    "Text": "Interview with Steve Paxton by June Johnston June Johnston: Steve, could you tell me what happened in the instant of innovation when you suddenly discovered you had something? Steve Paxton: (laughs) No, I couldn't. That instant began for me probably in 1961 and is still continuing. It's simply part of the process of exploration that dance work has been for me. There was not an instant. There were many, many years of classes, compiling of material from different movement forms. There was a time when several of us in v ermont who were working on this form decided to name it. I was actively looking for a name for an '.it' that we· obviously were all involved with. June: Could you say what that 'it' was? Steve: Well, Contact Improvisation was chosen as a name because it expresses it well. It's a strange name, I think, but it it hasn't seemed to have hampered it at all because it is accurate. It is definitely a physical art and you deal with the other person physically but there's also all the other aspects of person that are contacting each other. Volume 4 1979 CQICI Sourcebook 1"

    "Abstract": "This article provides a brief history of Contact Improvisation, tracing its origins from Steve Paxton's work in 1972 to the formation of ReUnion and the establishment of Contact Quarterly.",
    "Text": "A SHORT HISTORY During a Grand Union residency at Oberlin College in January 1972, Steve Paxton made a work for 11 men in which they threw, caught, flung, collided and fell among one another continuously for l 0 minutes. Then they stood for a few minutes. The dance was called 'Magnesium'. That spring, while teaching at Bennington College, Steve met with two studentsLeon Felder and Nita Little-who had been stimulated by a similar curiosity with the physical forces that effect motion, experimenting with lifting, falling and exchanging weight with mutual support. In June 1972, with funding from Change, Inc., Steve gathered about 15 \"of the best athletes that I had run into in the course of a year or two of teaching,\" both men and women, to explore the principles and potential of communication first evident in 'Magnesium'. The first week was spent in rehearsal. The 2nd week was a public showing of the working process, 5 hours daily, at the Weber Gallery in NYC. This event was called Contact Improvisation. Among the participants were Laura Chapmen, Steve Christiansen (video), Barbara Dilley, Leon Felder, Mary Fulkerson, Danny Lepkoff, Nita Little, Alice Lusterman, Curt Siddall, Nancy Stark Smith, Nancy Topf and David Woodberry. Inspired by this event, the work continued. A tour in early 1973 brought Steve Paxton, Curt Siddall, Nancy Stark Smith, Nita Little and Karen Radler to the West Coast, performing and leading workshops in Contact Improvisation under the name, 'You Come, We'll Show You What We Do'. The ambience of the work in performance continued to be informal: no music, special lighting or costume, audiences in the round, duets and trios interspersed with solo dancing. In June 1973, Steve brought a group to Europe for the first time to perform Contact at L' Attico Gallery in Rome. By 1974, Nita, Curt and Nancy were in the San Francisco Bay Area teaching the form to others, creating more dance-mates and developing a context for the work's expansion. Joined by Steve Paxton, in 1975 they formed ReUnion, the first formal Contact Improvisation company, meeting once a year to tour the West Coast with performances and classes. The continuing dialogue concerning Contact's development soon included hundreds of other individuals and groups. The Contact Newsletter (now Contact Quarterly) was initiated by ReUnion in 1975, edited and produced by Nancy Stark Smith, to foster communication among the geographically dispersed teachers, performers and practitioners of Contact. Inspired by the work, the work continues. ~ Lisa Nelson & Nancy Stark Smith 2 CQ/CI Sourcebook Susan Milani and Alan Gardner Volume 5 1979-80"

I want to drum up this spirit. In teaching Contact I feel two things: 1. That I know and understand the form but in order to convey the spirit through the form I must find a something to teach which is not outside to myself but is me 2. I've come here to Missoula and I feel that the form \"Contact\" is pretty much com man knowledge or thought to be by .._, alot of people and there are lots of expectations to what it is \"Get out the mats do a round robin\" So I think in order to teach the spirit of contact I cannot teach Contact. I want to create a situation in which free play FREE PLAY can happen Where a certain concentration is going with a certain practice and nothing happens until something is happening I want to create a situation where 1 nothing happens (an exhausted state) AND 2 (when you dont know whats gonna happen is happening) SO TEACH A CLASS IN WHICH YOU REACH A STATE WHERE NOTHING IS HAPPENING BUT POSSIBILITIES ARE OPEN THATS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO ------SURPRISES -VOICE WORK --SHOUT A WORD TO EACH OTHER---GO OUT AND TAKE A WALK AROUND THE ROOM-----Volume 1 1975-76 CQICI Sourcebook 3"

    "Abstract": "Steve Paxton discusses the connection between Mary Fulkerson's Anatomical Release work and Contact Improvisation, noting the ease with which Fulkerson's students assimilate Contact due to her focus on anatomical awareness and efficient movement patterns.",
    "Text": "DARTINGTON MARCH: Images. Spent time with Mary Fulkerson, teaching and taking classes. Several of our number [contacters] have studied with Mary, and she has spent time in Contact, though she prefers her own work as a basis from which to teach. However, the continuing juxtaposition of her Anatomical Release work and Contact has provoked a headful of thought; her students in England and those from Rochester, N.Y. take to Contact with remarkable ease compared to other groups in the U.S. This ease of assimilation is of interest. While the students are lying down, crawling, walking or running, Mary Fulkerson speaks ritually, encouraging greater sensitivity to alignment and efficient patterns in the body. The manner of presentation tends to by-pass the though~ of the listener. The listener is preoccupied with moving or relaxing at the time, and the ritualization has a lulling effect, soothing in tone and timing. The images she provides are simplified anatomical 'cartoons' of functioning anatomy as opposed to intellectual or visual anatomy. These images describe .sensations their location in the body and possible directions in which they might move. The students then assimilate material directly from their own sensations, culled from releasing unnecessary tension, work, strain. Mary Fulkerson finds a rare balance of authority and humility which gives fundamental weight to her voice without usurping the motivation of the student and avoiding their rebellion or fascination. Nor does her voice question the integrity of the sensations unique to each student. Their confidence in the process gathers momentum with the growth of awareness of the functional anatomy, and soon, non-anatomical images can be simply physicalized. Earlier in the process however, before these channels become clear, an illogical image would more likely provoke bewilderment, scorn, or intellectual interest, than movement. The parallel is with the Contact 'stand': The mind of the listener is encouraged to become a receiving instrument. Fulkerson's images further provide guidance to sensations which improve function. The stand in Contact isused to remove the habitual masking of the forces-that-be by relaxing the listener into states of mind where time, gravity, mass and inertia are apparent, where balance is seen as subtle movement, and social expectations in partnering can be dropped; it is possible to talk directly to the body~ and for the listener to listen directly with the body. Each person can hone and direct real physical sensations into their own most direct & efficient dance. As Mary Fulkerson is currently presenting her work at Dartingtim College (Devon, England) it is used as a first step providing the student with a map into private anatomical sensations and improvements. Great care has been given to the anatomical propriety of the images, because in this work, the idea each person's mind holds of their body is seen as crucial to the awareness each develops. Beyond Mary Fulkerson's work there is a question for the student at Dartington. What to do with the vocabulary they have sensed and the improvements they find in their use of the body? Many possibilities exist, and one path, that of Contact, seems quite compatible; moving from the interior of one's functioning anatomy, to functioning with another. I hope in the coming years more of us have an opportunity to sample this connection. STEVE PAXTON 4 CQ/CI Sourcebook Volume 1 1975-76"

    "Abstract": "Nancy Stark Smith introduces the Contact Quarterly, explaining its voluntary nature, the collaborative spirit of Free Association, and the shared experiential knowledge of Contact Improvisation that unites its contributors.",
    "Text": "Welcome. Yes; you're in the right place. The Contact Newsletter has moved on to become the Contact Quarterly a publication put out voluntarily by Free Association four times a year (seasonally). Free Association isn't an official name for those of us behind the Quarterly, but a term that catches the spirit of our collaboration. Our personnel shifts with each issue depending on (1) which coast is hosting the production, and (2) the availability and interest of local contacters for work on the production. Our common center is a working and experiential knowledge of Contact Improvisation. So far, everyone who has 'freely associated' on any of the Newsletter/Quarterly publications has had some experience with this new, now almost five-year-old, dance-movement-meditation-art-sport-event-piece. On that basic ground we 'stand', and from that stand we swing out into our overlapping worlds to collect material and enthusiasm to channel back through the center and out as far as it travels. Arriving safely and with news. Contact is interface. And though there are only certain faces you've seen before, there are many more where they came from. Parallel transparencies. Two people inventing electricity within days of each other on opposite sides of the globe. Coincidence? Yes, Co-Incidence. And in a likewise but less dramatic manner, we find more of each other every day. Contact Improvisation has the unique quality of being believed whether admired, respected, scorned, berated, inflated or ignored. Yes real time. Yes real bodies. Yes real people. This particular credibility allows Contact Improvisation and those involved in it, to run tangent to many worlds relating deeply in to those worlds without either becoming distracted or dilute. In fact, the communication which we continue to develop among ourselves and articulate in our dancing serves us well outside our immediate numbers. It is what creates our access to the unfamiliar faces, the rapidly surfacing and the as-yet unsurfaced numbers of people who are working with the material of their lives in just such a direct manner as we attempt in our teaching, performing and writing of Contact Improvisation. We 'stand' together at the ring of a watering hole; our weight brings the water up, our bodies, the weight down. So, that's where we come from. And here is where we are."

    "Text": "The image I had for the last issue (Winter 1976) was the water hole. The place where we collect to drink. A circle where everyone who comes fits in. All those cows bent to the water, the lines of their backs, helped me re-invent the wheel. At the watering hole we stood in order to bring our weight down; our weight brought the water up. We came full circle. This time we started again with nothing. New moon. We collected ourselves. As the last light left, we arranged ourselves in a blind configuration; (blackout on stage, the lights come up and the performers arc all in place). We started. Then the crescent moon we seemed to use the light as it grew, filling in the implied circle. Journal entry, March 24: \"   Musing new directions, transition at its most spread out point, as entropy of possibilities peaks.\" The moon, a new image to fill, and we, in as much detail as possible, articulate the filling. Learning the ropes means knowing how far they can take you; how much weight they can hold. One day, the arc of the rope's swing is predictable and suddenly short. There is another side; the side just outside your reach. But is your reach the rope's, or, if you can find a vehicle with a larger range should you ride it. \"Limits are what any of us are inside of,\" Charles Olson said in a talk that was recorded. In ReUnion's Contact classes we often talk during the warm up. Not necessarily to suggest specific activities, exercises or structures, but to create an environment, to supply images that may call out a particular awareness. We talk to the body as it experiences sensation. We say, \"You know that place when you stretch, the place where the muscle has eased out to its limit, that place on the edge of stress, on the edge of pain.\" We say, \"Work there, spend some time there, on this side of the edge.\" \"The edge is home,\" Lee Breuer said during a radio interview in Washington, D.C. in 1975. But it seems the edge is moveable that by sensing the limit, respecting it, you encourage it to open. A push comes to a shove. But if you go only as far as you are welcome, you are invited back. What has this got to do with the Contact Quarterly. Not sure, only that I sat down to present the image I was having for this process. How we stand. How we stand still, and keep moving. Palm Sunday. Full Moon. Lunar Eclipse."

    "Text": "Contact Improvisation is a way for people to come together and interact on a purely physical level. Fostering a healthy interaction is the important concern. In coming to a dance one must be ready to engage in a constant effort to focus on the physical sensations of weighted movement, balance and stillness. It is not the issue to identify through any conscious thought process what the sensations are; you need not know \"what physical sensations you are experiencing,\" you must know how to focus with constant effort. It is. the strength and purity of this effort which will foster a healthy interaction in dancing with another. The simplicity of the form Contact Improvisation is a gift. Its value is that it Is A Way for you and I to dance together. To befriend the forces of gravity and momentum is to dance with a sense of humor and constant humility, is to discover one's being self, is to discover true communion. The essence of this dancing is the concentration and focus one brings as a dancer, it is only through this constant effort that our dancing will continue to be.

    "Abstract": "Danny Lepkoff reflects on the profound impact of Contact Improvisation on his life, emphasizing the importance of communion, responsibility, and the shift from student to teacher, while envisioning Contact's growth as a social function for communal reinforcement and healthier daily interactions.",
    "Text": "The work I have done in Contact Improvisation has, needless to say, had a powerful eff~ct in my life. In the late spring of 1972 Steve told me of a piece he wanted to do in N.Y.C., and I went down there to rehearse and perform a dance called Contact Improvisation. The work that was done for that performance and subsequent gatherings for intense periods of dancing was larger and affected more levels of my being than I was aware of at the time. Most forceably I was struck by the simple yet overwhelming experience of communion with another person achieved through the dancing, and the freedom as well as discipline found within that communi~n. I remember feeling literally transported to another world when dancing, a world in which I was able to become a stronger self than I lived with day to day. I don't think, in that first performance, anyone fully realized the power of the forces brought into play among us. Many injuries, pulled, sore, and knotted muscles were the physical result of irresponsibility in the face of those forces. I became impressed with a sense of responsibility to myself and those I was dancing with to create a healthy interaction. The work done during that concert became not something I could forget. The realm of Contact Improvisation I realized was not \"dance\" but living, the forces at play between two people dancing are those forces which exist day to day, the strong self I had experienced was nothing but myself. I was left with the ever present challenge to realize my strong self in day to day living as well as the responsibility of achieving a healthy and true communion with those people I meet day to day. I suppose this task is universal for all living beings, however I have received a lot of strength and focused energy specifically from the work I have done with Contact Improvisation. I realize now that in order to continue this work I must be involved in the process of transmission. lt'seems that with understanding and experience of the forces at play in Contact Improvisation, receiving becomes transmitting, student becomes teacher, dancing becomes giving. It seems very natural, and I do not hesitate to think that any one who has had enough experience with Contact will feel this shift of role. It is no wonder there are now many teachers of Contact Improvisation. The dancing is just beginning to expand on a social level, into our society. What will be the direction of this expansion? Contact was created in the context of the dance art world. This is a good place, however the traditions of possession and ownership among artists are unhealthy for Contact Improvisation. My dream is that Contact will grow to become a social function. Periodically people living in the same area will gather for a day or week of dancing, for the sole function of communally reinforcing and acknowledging the strong self inside each person in the face of those one lives with. Walking down the street and greeting someone, buying groceries in a store, and all the daily interactions of people will be on a truer more realistic footing, and a general climate of health may be achieved. This may seem far fetched but I feel the beginning is at hand and in view of this direction it is obvious that we need to: continue dancing and deepening our experience and familiarity with the forces at play in Contact Improvisation keep lines of communication open, i.e. this newsletter, and cooperatively give and share the experiences and information gleaned from dancing and teaching. The class I tried to start in Bennington this summer did not work out. I am trying again this fall to get some people together to dance. I think I will be picking apples this fall. The seasons are changing here, color on the trees and colder nights and shorter days, new feelings emerge and don't fit comfortably yet. Hope to see some of you again, maybe hit the west coast again this year. Hello to All"

    "Abstract": "This article describes Contact Improvisation as an expression of sensitivity, involving two bodies in contact, communicating through impulses, weight, and momentum, and emphasizing yielding to the present moment and organic transitions.",
    "Text": "As a performer I have often been approached . by members of the audience who are in wonder about the phenomenon of Contact Improvisation. A 170-pound man is dancing with a 120-pound woman, rolling up and down her back and over her shoulders, or being carried by her. Is it a skill of gymnastic trickery? Not at all. Contact Improvisation is an expression of sensitivity in both the physical and emotional realms. It demands, above all, the ability to yield to the present moment. On a descriptive level, Contact Improvisation . is a new movement form, improvisational in nat.ure, involving two bodies in contact. Impulses, weight and momentum are communicated through a point of physical contact that continually rolls across and around the bodies of the dancers. Take two human bodies standing face to face. Each one has a center of gravity within the body somewhere in the vicinity of the navel, the exact location depending on the proportions of the individual. If they lean towards each other and support each other simultaneously, they then create a weight/mass system that ttas a center of gravity in space somewhere between their na~els. Like boleroes, fluid and eccentrically weighted, the dancing bodies swing, bounce, roll, swim and fly through and with the the common center of gravity. As the participants move, this center moves. The original format for conducting contact sessions is a \"round robin.\" As the participants· circle around the space a dynamic environment is created; in response to this environment, the dancers allow certain beginnings to occur. In· tention and forcefulness have nothing to do with all of this: The dance is ever changing, never the same. A series of events takes place as uninterrupted, pure transition from a beginning to an end. Working with Contact Improvisation is discovering how it feels to let this transition take place organically. In each individual duet it becomes apparent when an ending needs to happen. The dancers are obligated by the form to let these endings occur. Like any discipline, Contact Improvisation requires serious work to gain proficiency. As in learning a new language, the movement and concepts feel awkward at first, but with practice one is able to find a personal range of expression. Participation is not limited to \"dancers,\" but rather to anyone who wants to develop new skills in movement. The technique is most influenced by the disciplines of aikido, hatha and pranayama yoga and gymnastics, all of which teach us tt1at energy is conserved if the body knows how to flow along"

    "Abstract": "Ernst von Glasersfeld reflects on Contact Improvisation from an observer's perspective, suggesting that it involves not two but four entities: the two selves of the dancers, each striving to maintain contact while being both subject and object of the other's actions.",
    "Text": "In ordinary, every-day situations, to make contact there have to be two. That seems a commonplace and we simply take it for granted. Watching Contact Improvisation, however, is a strange experience at first. The making, keeping, and stretching of contact, there, does not easily fit the accustomed conceptual schema. It takes quite a while to discover the reason: Its contacts involve not two but four. In the world of our experience, what we call our \"self\" is no more and no less than what we experience of ourselves. In terms of our senses, our \"self\" is composed of what we perceive of ourselves, visually and tactually for the most part, plus what we internally sense about the states of , our muscles and organs. This \"self\" is necessarily very different from what we are in the experiential world of another person who, visually and tactually, experiences us from a wholly different point of view. In Contact Improvisation, therefore, there are two selves, each striving to maintain contact with another person. Both are constantly the acting subject of their own actions, and at the same time they are the object of the other's actions. And since the possibilities of making and maintaining contact are nearly always many, the coordination of motion of the one dancer that perceives the other and the other that perceives the one, is threatened at every moment. There is a perpetual struggle to neutralize inherent discrepancies and to preserve a reciprocally invariant relationship of contact. Seen from the outside, this becomes a powerful and at times shattering allegory of the precariousness of any harmony in human relations. If this is not too idiosyncratic an interpretation, it must raise the question: Will Contact Improvisation really remain a moment-to-moment improvisation or will it gradually develop regularities, fixed sequences, and rules? Contact of two independent agents can be maintained only to the extent to which one can foresee the motions of the other. (That goes for ALL relationships, and that is why we always need some rules and conventions). To IMPROVE in the art of Contact Improvisation (or in the art of relating to others)"

It emphasizes releasing muscular tension and embracing natural movement possibilities like rolling, falling, and being upside down, leading to free duet dancing and the expression of one's essential energy.",
    "Text": "Contact Improvisation is a duet movement form. Two people move together, in contact, maintaining a spontaneous physical dialogue through the kinesthetic sensual signals of shared weight and common or counterpoised momentum. The body, in order to open to the sensations of momentum, weight, and balance, must learn to release excess muscular tension and abandon a certain amount of willful volition to .the natural flow of movement at hand. Skills such as rolling, falling, and being upside down are explored:, guiding the body to an awareness of its own natural movement possibilities. Simple and direct duet exercises allow couples to explore and focus on specific relationships which come up in free improvisation i.e. supporting or taking someone's body weight, giving your own weight, jumping on someone, rolling off of someone. Once certain simple exercises and sensations are introduced the realm of organic body movement becomes very accessible to the body, and a great deal of one's essential energy can be expressed. It becomes important to develop a state of alertness, the senses so poised, that one may work in an energetic state of physical disorientation with safety, trusting one's basic survival instincts. All the work leads to free duet dancing: together with a partner one freely explores movement possibilities, an experiment, a time to ·play, a time to dance togetherness, a time to be and speak through your body. Contact Improvisation deals fundamentally with organic body movement. Organic body movement is motion manifest in activity directly dealing with the physical forces of the environment, gravity being the major influence, ~ovemc:nt in which the body and senses are engaged in the effort of survival.· Sports and games develop the body's organic movement possibilities to a peak. \"Contact\" has been called an art-sport. Contact Improvisation speaks for the belief that the realm of organic body movement is limitless and rich in the possibilities for expression of one's self, one's being. ••••••••••a"

It explores the needs fulfilled by contact improvisation, the potential for it to break down power imbalances, and the relationship between the contact community and the larger society, including questions of accessibility and elitism.",
    "Text": "On Saturday afternoon August 20, 1977, some thirty participants and teachers of FOCUS 8/77 gathered to talk about the Politics of Contact. The issue was as much one of defining the question or concern as it was coming up with an answer. The discussion began with a minimal definition of politics: awareness of and concern for the power relationships in a given interaction or situation, particularly those relationships which are unacknowledged. or assumed and unquestioned. From this beginning the discussion was wide-ranging, spirited and largely unstructured. Going back over a ta pc-recording of the seminar a month later, I have selected out and arranged (without regard to original sequence) representative and provocative comments to share with the larger contact community. To my knowledge this discussion was the first attempt to look at our work from this perspective and clearly it is only one small step, but an important one. In retrospect, I saw our talk centering around two issues.· The first was seldom defined as a focus but kept surfacing in people's comments: what kind of needs are filled by contact improvisation'? Consuelo: I was interested in figuring out why it's come down that because of privilege like the $125 privilege and the class background privilege, why it is that this environment has developed around contact; but I don't see that contact itself is this white cultural kind of   John: I'm not sure I agree with that, for one thing it's demonstrating the needs   contact like anything else is fulfilling certain needs. Eleva: That's what I was going to say earlier, perhaps it's the white middle class that needs to get in touch with their bodies. Tom: What I see it gets down to is am I willing to go into the world receptively and attentively to what's happening around me and to be in touch with my needs in a particular situation and other people's needs. I really think it is something about the reason we're here is because we need to be here, else we wouldn't be here, to learn whatever we're getting from this, and I see it very much in spiritual terms   this group of people is here to get what we're getting and I think a lot of people don't need it or are doing it in another form. Elizabeth: The same kinds of things that happen in contact are things that I think have happened to other kinds of people in other situations, like in work situations where men do heavy physical work together and might have to use their bodies in the same kind of cooperation and same kind of sensitivity to each other   but different than a dance situation   which comes with a different kind of awareness. Broni: Its purpose is different too. Mark: This may relate to why this kind of event is strictly one ethnic group or one social class. I'm concerned in society all over the country how it seems there's a great gap between this kind of situation of workshops and focusing on a specific kind of dance and what I would call the masses   their desire to move and to socialize and be part of something which is being generally exploited. For those people who are not coming to studio spaces and being part of something, the whole word dance means to them Friday night and swallowing a six pack of beer and going to a bar or disco; I think it's exploitative and I really feel there's a gap between that space and this space and it's really tough to breach. jerry: Contact has a lot in common with folk art and we are a folk   we invent it as we go along, we make it out of what we've got and the fact that what we've got is a college education, and money, and attractive healthy bodies, and good teeth, you know, is different from having a bunch of mahogany trees and a couple of rocks   Contact improvisation has roots in dance, it was found by dancers, and it has gone away from being a dance thing; it is a movement form. There are people here who are not primarily dancers and the form is reaching out toward those people the way some people seem to think we should be reaching out toward different classes of society or different ethnic groups. Mark: I feel that there are some aspects of this kind of dance that are slightly different than any kind of particular outlet that supplies the needs for any particular ethnic group. I really feel that there are some aspects of contact that are evolutionary .. I can't think, unless somebody can fill the space, of other kinds of dance in the past which have been this free with sharing and this much touch and connections .. I think this kind of dance is more significant in specific kinds of problems, like sexual politics, for example, men dancing with men   and even in the sense that it doesn't rely upon other forms like music goes right to an essence or centering   This form of dance crosses a few more bridges than others have. Consuelo: You mean in the sense that it is kind of like a future vision of how people can relate to each other in terms of sensitivity and activity? Jon: In terms of sexual politics we're still dealing with one on one, two people getting together, and contact gives you metaphors for expanding that to three or four or ten or twenty or whatever and that should be explored too. · Keriac: Watching a ballet that gets into these boy.girl things, I don't get much metaphor for my life from those; whereas I really find the material in contact, the interpersenal stuff that's happening in contact, is a really useful sophisticated metaphor for what I'm experiencing. · Consuelo: Right now I feel really committed to art for change. It's really not enough to do a contact performance for me, it really isn't. I feel like I want to know more what's going to come out and deliver a message; and I don't mean just whatever message is there but I mean pretty specific messages. Kris: There's something about pure energy that gets exchanged between people, we become something of everything we are around, and when I see a performance I become those performers; and it means a lot to me and it's the strongest and most pure learning experience I have and it's devoid of content. It's not statements. Consuelo: Well, that sounds like a pretty powerful statement. I see that most of these needs in relation to contact have to do with the desire to break down the uneven power of the various roles that people assume in relating to one another, be it male to male, dancer to nondancer, or performer to audience. Contact improvisation as a political process can thus be seen as a means for bringing people together in a way that prevents or at least discourages the assumption of roles and inequalities of power which roles so often establish. There seemed to be agreement that, on an immediate personal level, contact achieved this aim if the integrity of the physical form was respected. The second issue of the discussion seemed to center around the kind of relationship the contact community and the contact form is establishing with the larger society. Does and will this relationship maintain the same freedom from inequalities in power and thus allow all people access to the vital (role-less?) movement relationships which are contact improvisation? Karen: The way to deal with it is to work on both levels one is on the normal ground level of literally dealing, believing that change takes place and revolution takes place within my own body first and then at the same time being aware of where my body is: is it in the studio, in Cat's Paw, and that door is closed unless I have $125, and then what do I do about that; and I think there are two different issues and both are necessary. Brent: But we made this experience available for ourselves   at least I did. Karen: Because it is within your program in life to be able to do that. We're talking about a whole part of the world where it isn't part of the program it's not there   so is art going to be something we're talking about, an eclectic thing that stays where it is, or can this particular art form go out because it doesn't have to have all that professional dilettantism that other forms have. Can it just be a way of reaching people on another basis? Laurie: Not right now. john: This is a white middle class trip and other people out of that might not necessarily want to have it. Laurie: And they might and they can't because they can't afford to. John: That's not true. Laurie: If one person wants to and can't   John: There have been set up free situations for people to study this and it is only taken by white upper class people. ' Ernie: Sometimes it becomes a real trip that we are laying on them because we don't have the sensitivity to know what they need. Mark: What is the balance between being crusaders for contact and making it an available form for those that are interested? John: It is a manifestation I think in many ways of class differences and therefore class problems that we should deal with; solutions are tough. Evelyn: Most of the arts are a social   I mean there's a certain class of people that do them. For a long time they were a very elitest thing. Ernie: But is it elitist? That word really blows my mind cause it's a power term. It assumes that if we develop a dance form, it is automatically elitist. It's a dance form!   something that came out of our culture. Our culture may be elitist in a lot of ways money and social structures generally, but that doesn't mean the dance form is elitist. Laurie: But it reflects the society. Karen: I am forever grateful in one way, in an aesthetic sense, and in other ways, for things that have come out of formalized, in a sense elitist, art forms and I value them. Then I hear what we're saying on the other side. Now is there room for both ways to be? Keriac: If you are thinking of contact as a folk art and experiencing it, it is quite a different setup than if you are thinking of it as a performing art or a spectator thing. Like Karen was talking about, how can we have both of these things, that they both enrich our lives? I think that it is facetious to say that it is a folk art so that we can all rest our minds about that, you know, that we don't have to be concerned about   that we're clean; this is a folk art, it's ok. One can use contact lots of other ways the relative morality, the rightness or wrongness or whether it fits into your value system should be examined. Ernie: If you take something like contact   and you can make it into where you're more sensitive to life in general, the balances and flux of life in general, then it becomes evolutionary; but if you take it and it becomes another package, then that's what it is, another package. Some questions arc asked. concerns expressed and a dialogue begins. I hope the excerpts above may have provoked thoughts in you and that you will share them with others. It is part of the dance.

I believe this work and other explorations compatible with Contact always involve the element of risk, whether we are rolling along air-born arcs or standing still. As flow does not mean slow, receptivity needn't be measured by passivity. 'Listening' is one of my favorite words in describing the force behind transition.

Besides the basic sense of too much or not enough (alternately, I've been told by students how there is excessive technical input or a frustration due to a casual and modest directive), we learn to use the word if it fits. Of course there is still much more to say.

It was a logical organic progression. The body was the teacher.

Watch babies. They have much to teach about how to teach and learn. In teaching/learning contact improvisation, what are the first steps? What are the basic experiences needed for the next step and the next? Perhaps it would be helpful to remember, to retrace, the first year of contact improvisation. What is the last thing you learned?

    "Abstract": "This article explores the value of discomfort and imperfection in Contact Improvisation, suggesting that the \"bad dancing\" on the edge of the circle can be a rich source of learning and growth. It emphasizes the importance of embracing the fear of opening and finding companionship in the ever-present indications of what is possible.",
    "Text": "I learn from knowing I am uncomfortable, and going ahead; and the going ahead being the letting-go-ahead. So the discomfort is to be appreciated. It is an environment from which springs an opening. Contact embraces this fear of itself. this seminal verge. We are concerned with where the dancing originates. At times it appears to me that the important thing is not the dancing in the center of the circle. but the experience on the edge of the circle, the often disquieting dance on the verge. This view, which might be seen as antithetical to the work. is also necessarily part of its premise. The invitation to feel the dread of opening is an inherent part of the total occurrence. Dances in which both bodies ride a shared wave of truly unleashed rise and falling are rare. Yet the dances which abound halting, starting repeatedly, responding to impulses a fraction of a second too slow to flow, doubting one's perceptions are rich with valuable information, honest manifestation of fluctuation between positive and negative response. We fear surrender. make our homes in the almost, and venture into readiness only when we must. The discomfort at the verge serves by intensifying the contrast: the darks get darker, the lights lighter, and the picture gets easier to see. I value this work not only for the rare glimpses of in-touch, in-time, in-tune. but for the companionship of the ever-present indications of what is possible. The form itself, if one exists beyond the instances of attempts to experience it. is none other than the existence of the possibility of a dance in which wills. instincts. and verges merge. Emergency, emerge, merge. It amounts to having to believe in a possibility which one may never have . experienced. All this to say I am devoted to something which I rarely feel, the possibility of which I never leave. We extend to ourselves an invitation which we rarely accept. but the extension of it is what matters. Living for so long on the verge of that acceptance, I figure it's time to call it home. o0 Christina Svane CHRISTl:\\A SVA'.\\:E :s a dancer·poet·teacher·video artist living in New York City."

It discusses the evolution of a language within the form and the challenges of communicating its principles to diverse audiences.",
    "Text": "By arranging and rebalancing our scrutiny and our relaxation of focus in our daily routine we find ways to our appropriate redemptions. The constant prayer that leads the pilgrim, Saint Therese's \"little way\", the yogi's systems of breathing, and the mover's attention to the body as it washes, waits for the bus, cleans out the catbox or ties a shoelace are among ways we focus our being towards whatever unexpectable or hoped-for visionary experience waits gracefully for us. Verbal languages and body languages both present regions of articulation, regions of common understanding, and regions of the unknown. By looking at \"what we know\" we approach the fascinating places of \"the unknown\". Historically, Contact Improvisation began with everything unknown and in the recent handful of years, a body of knowledge, perhaps a grammar of words and motions, has been evolving. We know we belong to the same tribe because we understand each other; we share a context. flexibility active bounce round robin circle breath play partner attention gravity momentum pathways floor honest dialogue wave trust weight float stillness skeleton mood glide interfacing contact rise skin center (This example is a random selection from lists of \"words related to Contact improvisation\" made during a writing seminar led by Nancy Stark Smith in Seattle, January 1979.) By now, hundreds and hundreds of people have had some exposure to the form and its language, through classes, workshops, performances, reviews, magazines, and photographs. People from all walks of life have attempted to describe, analyze, teach Contact in terms of their own vocabularies, which range from the scientifically spare to the wildly rhapsodic. Meeting changes and development within the practice of the form and colliding, assimilating, and crossing with words from other contexts, the language of Contact Improvisation attempts to stay clear, direct, and as immediate as the movement itself. The very obvious and the very subtle are always present in any utterance, pose, or figuration. Understanding the shapes and shades of meaning and of momentum is as easy and as dif ficult as understanding music or the weather. Embodying a concept may or may not use words before, during, and/ or after; when we seek discourse, the universe of words enters the picture. While a woman rolls in a wavelike motion across the floor, another woman waves to her, waving her hand. (Homonym phenomenon.) During \"the stand\", a condition of vertical rest, in which the skeleton is balanced so the muscles don't have to work to hold the body up, small adjustments and rebalancings were noted to go on involuntarily. When the accumulating jiggles and twitches were seen to be a continuity, there had to be something to call it, and it is \"the small dance\". This happened in the old days. Also in the old days, so many experimental movements were attempted that they were. given numbers. These days the only one that is called by its number is \"the 58\". \"58\" is a vault pivoting off the partner's thighs, around hip-to-hip, rolling over an arc across the partner's back, finally rolling off into the air or someplace else. Influx and innovation occur in oi.tr lingo through borrowings like aikido rolls, t' ai chi stepping; forward rolls; from physics and metaphysics we adapt and adopt referent points like counterbalance, chakra, yoga asanas, field .energies, ma.gnetism. Innovative word-invention can produce terms immediately understandable, for example, Simone Forti's use of \"artsport\" soon swept the Contact village and one feels again how perfect a word it is coming upon the ungainly \"sportart\" in a newspaper clipping. Other terms like \"blotto dance\" never quite caught on. \"Finger ouija\" may or may not be current. Obviously Contact's language functions among practitioners-only groups, and in mixed groups which include non-contactors. In the former case, assumptions are frequently taken for granted, based on common experience. Just as you can tell at once if your partner is really in kinetic dialogue with you, when verbal conversation flows the words are subsidiary to the moment, suppor-tive of the meaning. In the case of the latter, often contactors find ourselves making wild analogies with rock-climbing or talus-running (which we may not have done a whole lot of ourselves), trying to clarify concepts without having to demonstrate at cocktails just what a 58 is. When we are faced with a reporter, our mother, a dance teacher, a baseball fan, or a child who sees us doing it in the park, what words do we call up?

If you look the term up in a physics book, you find about half a page; they seem to think that it's so simple as not to be worth discussing a lot. But the concept is pretty deep when you think about it and use it to look at movement. Here I will be talking about center of gravity in the same physical sense that a physicist would use the term. I will leave aside meanings such as \"center from which you move\" or \"spiritual center,\" and try to show the richness of the simply physical interpretation. However, I am emphatically not saying that dance is \"nothing but physics\" more about that later. First I will explain and define the center of gravity for a rigid body, and then talk about the more interesting cases when the body changes shape and the center of gravity changes.

That we, like the joggers, therefore feel free to choose any direction for our practice ysical interaction that doesn't intentionally injure you or ow broad an activity can be before it has no parameters at all and call life, or in this case, human experience. When, in 1977, Steve ied, \"Just the pleasure of using your body is, I think, maybe the main an unplanned and spontaneous way, where you're free to invent and they're free to invent and you're e other-that's a very pleasant social form.\" However, it was by first establishing priorities that Contact was able to provide its particular kind of pleasure. Contact can be seen as a means for communicating through physical contact. Dialogue proceeds, using the exchange of weight between partners to tune them to the physical forces that effect their motion and to tune them to each other. At the outset of Contact Improvisation, a choice was made to minimize the social content of the contact and to work, initially, with the physical elements involved in the exchange. Stated or by example implied, this choice along with others brought depth to the practice of Contact by limiting its scope. By narrowing the focus of the activity, subtle information was made visible: the experience of gravity; the \"small dance\" of the skeleton balancing erect; the flow of weight through the body as it rolls across the floor; the exchange of weight between partners during lifting, throwing and catching; the sensation of sharing a dynamic center of balance with another mover. It has been 8 years since the decision to work with these specific physical elements. In this time, practice has revealed many principles that, serving as anchors, allowed the scope of partner exchange to widen. The practice of CI continues to suggest ways in which its principles and skills can be applied. Following these suggestions leads to fascinating work in dance, theatre, therapy and education. As the concern with physical contact and weight exchange becomes less of a focus in their work, many Contactors wonder whether they are still doing \"Contact Improvisation\". Others continue their studies regardless, not caring one way or the other what it is called. Contact, as an evolving system, tends to attract the forces that work to open what is fixed, change what is static. Ever since its formation as the Contact Newsletter in 1975, Contact Quarterly has reflected this eagerness to find relevance in a broad range of sources. In considering the direction of our interests, as editors we ask ourselves, 'What does shooting guns have to do with Contact Improvisation?' In shooting, one tests the accuracy with which a message of energy (power) can be delivered to a distant point (moving or still). As a 'vehicle for moving ideas', Contact Quarterly shares that aim.

    "Abstract": "This editorial reflects on the experience of falling in Contact Improvisation and life. It explores the concept of a 'blind spot' during a fall, and how staying awake and aware can transform falling into a dynamic balance and a state of grace.",
    "Text": "\"There is a bit of insanity in dancing that does everybody a great deal of good.\" Edward Denby Letters Editor Note When I first started falling by choice, I noticed a blind spot. Somewhere after the beginning and before the end of the fall, there was darkness. And then the floor. Luckily, there were mats at first. Soon I learned that the end of the fall was the beginning of another move, usually a roll. That gave me somewhere to go. So I rolled. At the end of that roll was another roll, and at the end of that, another. Then, I noticed another blind spot. Somewhere after the beginning and before the end of the roll, there was darkness. In that darkness, however, I noticed a body moving, a body that knew just where to go. The blind spot in the fall is the moment when the fall and the faller lose synch. The faller falls asleep and her body falls without guidance to the floor. Truly lost in space. Ever fall asleep at the wheel? You 're so tired your eyelids stick together each time you blink ·until they pop wide open as you realize you've just been driving 60 mph on the highway with your eyes closed, for how long? The same sensation occurs while falling. You wake up shortly before reaching the floor, just in time to hastily steer yourself to safety. Adrenalin makes your hair stand up. The more I fell, the more familiar the sensation of dropping through space became, the less disoriented I was during the fall. Staying awake from the first moment of balance-loss, I found that falling was in itself a dynamic balance. One in which the forces at play-gravity, momentum and mass-were all operating in their natural order and if my mind was with me I could gently guide that fall toward a smooth landing. Confidence came with experience and soon enjoyment took the place of fear and disorientation. In the course of a Contact Improvisation duet, I found myself taking every possible option to fall. I would slip out unexpectedly from under my partner just to take the ride: head first, feet first, horizontally, diagonally; falling became irresistible. It has become clear; there is no where we can stay put. Even standing, we execute a continuous fall. The expression, 'fall from grace,' becomes an impossible statement when falling is itself experienced as a state of grace. This is not to say that disorientation, confusion and dis-ease have no place in the geometry of balance. They, in fact, stimulate the balancing mechanism. Stimulate us to ask questions: what is dis-ease, what does healthy mean, how do we recognize and maintain it? How can we stay awake during the fall; this is the healing issue.

Healthy, however, means 'to be whole'' and is linked to the words \"holy\" and \"beauty\" (the Greek word for health is \"koilo\" meaning beautiful). An unhealthy person is damaged, not whole. A holy person is a whole being. So, the meaning of health expands beyond the physical aspect. Being healthy involves the dynamic integration of body, mind and soul in a process of creative self-expression   we are healthy to the degree that we are manifesting our possibilities. Our culture seems to be overly rational and intellectual-separating mind and body. I know, for example, that most architects live in their heads and experience with their eyes.

    "Text": "Dear Contact Quarterly, Coming from a background of psychology and movement therapy, I am intrigued by the similarities between what I have experienced in Contact Improvisation and my experience in psychological therapies. The following is a brief synopsis of the psychological theories I have looked at in this way. Gestalt Therapy-focuses on \"being in the now.\" By paying attention to our inner needs in each moment, we relinquish the avoidances in our lives and commit ourselves to confronting, and living in the present. Jungian Approach to Therapybased on Carl Jung's belief in the existence of the feminine and masculine in each of us regardless of our gender. The essence of the work in Jungian therapy is to balance out, and come to a resolution of the imbalanced or conflicted opposites within us. Various theories of Group Dynamics-predictable behavior patterns inherent in the development of a group which evolve out of the unfolding of contact and intimacy amongst the members of a group. Theme of rejection-a common denominator to most therapies. Based on denial of a human being's primary need for love and acceptance, usually going back to one's early relationship with parents. The building of trusting and honest relationships is a key factor in any mode of therapy to help counteract feelings of unworthiness, and the fear of rejection. Some thoughts: I am wondering if more attention should be paid to Volume 5 1979-80 Contact Improvisation as a healing art by bringing psychological consciousness to Contact classes, jams, and workshops? And if so, how do we do this? (Also, has it been, or is it presently being done by anyone?) Will doing this change Contact Improvisation from an educational to a psychological process, and if so, do we want to do this? So, to sum up, can (and how can) an exploration of psychological theories and techniques shed some light on to the psychological framework within Contact Improvisation in order to open up greater potentiality for the teaching and dancing experience of Contact Improvisation? Would love to have an exchange of ideas on this by contacters who have experience and expertise within the field of psychology. Toward growth and wholeness, Deborah Goldberg Greenfield, Mass."

    "Text": "CONTACT IMPROVISATION is an evolving system of movement based on the communication between two moving bodies and their combined relationship to the physical laws that govern their motion-gravity, momentum, inertia. The body, in order to open to these sensations, must learn to release excess muscular tension and abandon a certain quality of willfulness to experience the natural flow of movement. Practice includes rolling, falling, being upside down, supporting and giving weight to a partner. Alertness is developed in order to work in an energetic state of physical disorientation, trusting in one's basic survival instincts. It is a free play with balance, self-correcting the wrong moves and reinforcing the right ones, bringing forth a physical/emotional truth about a shared moment of movement that leaves the participants informed, centered, and enlivened."

    "Abstract": "Daniel Lepkoff argues for the inclusion of Contact Improvisation in college dance and theater programs, citing its value in developing physical skills, presence, trust, and challenging traditional sexual roles.",
    "Text": "This statement was submitted to tbe Educational Policies Committee of Hampshire College, Amherst, Mass. on November 29, 1979. Contact improvisation is a movement technique. Though much younger than ballet or modern dance, it proves to be as rich and dee~. It ei_nbodies a progression of physical skills which can be used to train the beginner as well as challenge the virtuoso. Students of contact improvisation acquire access to a large realm of movement very quickly and begm to make significant changes in their movement patterns, strength, and sensitivity within three or four classes. This makes the technique particularly desirable for the theater student and non-dancer. The skills acquired in contact improvisation are by no means limited to the form itself. A deep understanding of weight, movement flow, and use of strength greatly aid anybody who desires to study ballet, modern dance, or other physical disciplines. The extensive exposure to the physical and mental states involved in improvising and discovering movement can help choreographers in their attempts to gather material for their set work. Contact improvisation directly strengthens one's presence. Just as one can become aware of the eyes seeing, the ears hearing, and the skin feeling, one can become aware of the mind sensing. Through practice of this dance form one becomes able to experience and observe the state of one's nervous system particularly when in an intimate physical relationship with another. This spawns an element of control over one's perceptual reality. This control and ability to focus is training in developing power. Personal power and strength of presence is essential in any performing situation as well as in daily life. Contact improvisation nurtures a basic physical trust between two people and among a group. The form demands a care and consideration of one's partner and towards this end seeks to develop sensitivity and confidence. This trust and the freedom which ensues kindles a rich and fertile environment for working creatively with another person. Knowledge and experience of this environment aids in any situation where people are working together, actors on stage doing a scene, or dancers performing a piece. The working relationships which develop in this form cross the boundaries created by sexual roles; men dance with men, women with women, and men with women alike. I do not know of anv artistic discipline in which non-~exual, deep, and honest physical contact is explored with_ total equality relative to sex. In this form women lift men as often as men lift women. Women learn to exercise a kind of strength which often has never been encouraged, likewise men learn to allow themselves a soft, responsive, and non-competitive posture. It is a revelation to both partners that a one hundred and eighty pound man can be easily & completely supported by a one hundred pound woman. Again, the trust derived from freeing the traditional sexual roles creates a more comfortable and fluid atmosphere among any group of artists seeking to work together. Contact improvisation seems to be of particular value for the college age person. College students find themselves in an intense period of transition. They are coming to grips with the image and reality of themselves as adults. Thev are intently exploring the psychological politics of sexual relationships. This form offers them a grounded, simple, and clear opportunity to interact deeply and honestly with each other. It seems to serve as a reference point or forum for experiencing oneself in relationship with others in an unthreatening environment and without the need to formulate consciouslv or to talk about what is going on. The strongest evidence for the emotional supportive value of this work is the very real attraction students have for this form. They want to experiment and expand. This form gives them the opportunity to go ahead. In and of itself contact improvisation has become a significant movement within the dance world, recognized bv audiences and critics as a fascinating and evocative performance experience. Many up and coming dancers and actors are using the skills they've acquired through practice of this form to advance themselves in their artistic work. Considering its value as a supportive discipline for the actor studying theater or the dancer studying traditional techniques, as well as its presence as a new and viable dance form, I feel no hesitation in recommending to any college or university that contact improvisation be a permanent part of the curriculum of any program in dance or theater. ~"

    "Text": "reprinted from Contact Newsletter, Vol I No 5, Summer 1976 ] ack Wada (Sensei) Aikido instructor at [the University of California at Santa Cruz] gave a demonstration during the Contact Improvisation workshop 19 April [1976]. Aikido is a ] apanese Martial Art developed early this century by M. Uyeshiba, then a master of the extant martial arts. Aikido has valuable information for those who have eyes to see. Wadasensei did much to make the forces visible; spirals and curves to meet the pro-forma aggression of his 3 ukis, the energy of easy blending, guiding, leading and directing attack energy to its own neutered completion. Most valuable to me was Wada-sensei's unvarying unromanticized unstressed concentration. Seeing him react was information in deed. The martial arts are the arts of war. They have each been forged in the heat of life or death, and have matured through a lineage of survivors. Aikido is of particular interest due to breadth of vision of the situation of war. It does not stress the vs. but the non-polar 'we'. The intense realization which death brings to activity has graced the martial arts including Aikido with efficiency. This elegance of means is based on profound (because essential) information of body mechanics, training procedures, and physical possibilities. Here is infor· mation embodied in a seamless flow. The concentration which cannot bend. The accommodating winning maneuver. Contact Improvisation is not a martial art. It is perhaps an art sport if it is defined by the context in which it currently operates. The means of teaching are not those of life or death confrontation but life to life confrontation. The teaching philosophy is that of mildness, supposing that learning can be joyous, that the danger of finding is a pleasure in depth. Con• tact as a means has produced a community of particular information, an 'it' against which other things can be assessed, by which 'it' 'itself' can be gauged in living manifestation. It is time to question: What is the result? Is the fire hot enough to forge the solid concentration? ls mildness means enough to calm the seeker and show the teacher and the student a calm balanced center, to obliterate a hierarchical I (invitation to war, Atlas vs. Heracles) and to expose the We of us and the forces? Or is it a cheap thrill, placator, builder of influence for those with the sweets, waste of time spent in orgy of sensation? Compassionate teachers? Balanced teachers? Concentrating teachers? What will it be? The current generation is the test animal. Contact will always be reflected in our karma. Contact is serene. We think we know: the forces in play. 'It' /us are on the line. Things are always life or death. ~"

    "Abstract": "A conversation between Peter Ryan, Dena Davida, Ellen Nayduch, and Roger Neece discussing the practical and ethical considerations of organizing and promoting Contact Improvisation workshops and performances, including financial arrangements, competition, and community impact.",
    "Text": "Ellen: We're discussing the business of Contact-How to be a business manager or how not to be. What are the primary ingredients in putting on a performance? We came up with: a mailing list, space (size and location), scheduling, organizing. Are you doing it for a friend or, as Dena called it, are you taking a cut? What kind of expectations did you have as the organizer? Were they shared by the performer? Peter: I think that as a promoter you have to maintain your integrity. The fact is that we are part of the Contact community that stretches from coast to coast. There are times when people are bringing in someone they know only from reputation. There is a danger that you may get in over your head. You have to be able to say, \"no\" even though you want the workshop to happen, \"I'm sorry, I can't guarantee this amount of money or this number of students.\" You must be clear as to what you can generate and let the artist make the decision. Dena: Concerning integrity, there have been inklings and rumblings of competition for markets, like \"don't touch Oregon, it's mine.\" The Bay Area Contact Network in San Francisco, initiated bv Alan Ptashek and others [see CQ Vol IV No 3/4] is a model we can think about in the future to help us cooperate instead of compete. Isn't that the philosophy of our dance form? Ellen: In terms of competition among producers, the four of us mentioned that we hadn't been \"doing it\" lately, so someone else is obviously \"doing it\" instead. Dena: The first year that I sponsored people, I did it \"as a gift\", to help myself learn and to support contact in my community. I've grown to understand that it is important to take a percentage so that you don't feel that your energy is exploited. Roger: I've always thought that management is just as much of an art as the dancing. Ellen: On the East Coast Tour in 1978, it was suggested that the managers and the performers all take an equal cut. In this instance we were seen as equal partners. Roger: In actual fact, this arrange·· ment never happened. Dena: In Montr(al, we've never offered a guaranteed fee to the performer because we are not producers and have no money to back the performance. On the other hand, I've worked for the Muse\"e des beaux-arts de Montr~al which can produce the performance and take the risk of losing money. Ellen: What we're talking about is two styles, one where you are the manager and have all the responsibility and another where you broker the services of an institution. Clearly if you can broker these services it takes the risk, time, and frustration out of your hands to some degree. If you're going on your own, the failure or success is all yours. The expectation of a good performance can be crushed totally when no one shows up and there is no money to pay anybody, including yourself. a conversation between Peter Ryan, Dena Davida, Ellen Nayduch and Roger Neece at Current Exchange 1979 Peter: Dena's letter in the Contact Quarterly last year requested that people not take it for granted that if they gCJ on tour they're going to be able to get sponsors in each city. Again, if you are planning a tour, please be sensitive and respect the people who live there; they rely on their community for their livelihood. So, if you come in as a high profile performer you are going to milk the market. If you are on the road a lot or want to be on the road a lot, consider the fact that we are a limited market. You are placing a great burden upon your promotor to go beyond his/her neighborhood and dance community to generate that extra revenue for you. Roger: The easiest way to organize something is to affiliate yourself with a local dance studio that does modern or experimental work. You can use their mailing list, studio, facilities, etc. to piggyback with your own personal resources instead of taking on all the organizing yourself. A financial guideline: if you co-sponsor with someone (and they provide the postage and mailing, box office and publicity) the standard split is 50150. One situation or avenue that has been very successful in New York City is affiliation with galleries. The Paula Cooper Gallery has hosted three sets of performances, and the Holly Solomon Gallery sponsored one. In some cases they guarantee the performers a small fee, but usually they furnish only the space. Donations are requested. Peter: Vancouver is not a visual arts center, and galleries have not been a good alternative here. ._, Dena: In Montr~al, we've worked in three settings: Studio Catpoto, universities, local studios. Luckily we have always had our\"own work space and, given enough time, we can free it up for a week. We usually get it for a bargain price since we are the major renters, say 100 dollars for the week (and free classes for our landlords). Concordia University recently hired Andrew Harwood to teach, and Universit€ de Qufbec hired me-and paid us on guest teacher salaries. Occasionally Studio Nouvelle Aire has co-sponsored someone with us. Peter: If you can do it, get an institution to back you. Look for the museums, the community colleges, libraries, churches, public buildings with downtown plazas, art councils. Roger: It is also important to know your local area and what can and can't be done there. It's one thing to organize a workshop for ten people with a teacher who is your friend; it's another thing to plan a series of workshops, two or three performances and guarantee a fee of $500. You have to know beforehand what you're going to be able to handle. Dena: Getting very practical, I think about all the expenses. There's the airfare, fee for the space, poster design and printing, office supplies, postage, telephone, housing and food (in Montreal we usually bed and board the artist with us). Sometimes there are additional costs such as video, lighting equipment, tech personnel. Ellen: Listening to Dena's list of expenses and how they are or are not paid for, I would describe this process as \"grass roots\". If one looks at the actual costs to produce a concert, it can be quite expensive. It seems that in the Contact community we are relying much more on volunteer human resources, than financial resources. Dena: I find we're designing a new business context. I've also been involved with the National Endowment for the Arts touring program, and I see that contacters are working on a totally different basis (day to day survival, maybe?) Peter: In the winter of 1978, I sponsored Beth Goren and Danny Lepkoff. The workshops were each a week long and the fee was $ 50. There were 10 to 15 people per workshop so there was a healthy amount of money. The costs were not that great because airfare was not included. Ellen: So out of this gross income of $500 how much money did you make and how much time did you put in? Peter: I put in a lot of time, I did a lot of groundwork and I haven't even thought about the percentage. I had a separate bank account for all money I made as a sponsor and did not break it down for each individual project, but I probably made about$ 75 for each, about 20%. Ellen: One question that comes up in terms of percentages is the amount you take as the manager. I've also taken from 10 to 20 percent, depending on my experience at the time. Dena: The workshop classes have been the real money-making part of each residency. The performances have brought in a minor amount in every case. Ellen: Production costs are usually high compared to performance revenue. Whereas in a workshop, the overhead is low, the fees are high for the participants, and you're paying only one or two teachers. Dena: The cost is infinitely greater for five people. It's much easier to do a successful duet tour. Roger: One of the biggest problems has been finding a suitable space (large enough and with resilient floors), and then having to pay $ 5 or $10 an hour for many hours of classes. Peter: Sometimes it's difficult to negotiate a reasonable fee for a week of classes. In Vancouver, I've rented the Western Front and made arrangements to cover the cost of the space. I included that in the fee for the workshops. We don't work on a percentage basis either. Dena: In Montreal, we've always offered a flat rate for space, not by the hour or by a percentage. Ellen: Another thing you might consider, especially if you are in a learning phase, is bartering. Maybe you want to take the workshops for free in exchange for your services. Be clear from the beginning with yourself and the performer that that's all you want out of it. I think you'll find the amount of time it takes to produce a residency is much greater than you ever think it is. Dena: At Catpoto, we four (now six) help each other plan residencies, though one person takes the major responsibility (we alternate). We have a video person, and we all translate into French, in exchange for taking the classes. Ellen: Keep a clear, accurate record of expenses and make out a projected budget of income and expenses. And contracts. I highly recommend contracts even if you are promoting a friend. It's good business to make out a contract signed by both parties stating the exact requirements. It's not something you write up when the person arrives, it's something you agree on beforehand. Roger: Before you begin, it's also a good idea to talk with your local dance studios and find out what their experience has been in sponsoring other artists. You may get some idea of how receptive the non-contact community might be. Dena: Know your community and find out the schedule of other arts organizations (even a psychology convention could conflict). Don't overlap with other important events. Ellen: Time is another consideration. You need to accommodate both day and evening workers. Planning during college vacations is not a good idea. But no matter what schedule you make, someone is going to be unavailable or disappointed. Also, think about the location of the space. If transportation is not good or the locaheard of him. People were totally going on my say-so that this was going to be a good class. Peter: Essentially, the issue you are raising is that of selling the person. Some people do not have to be sold, their names are already commodities. Dena: Montreal is different because the commodity in the workshops I have sponsored has been Contact Improvisation itself, not the reputation of the teacher. The large T'ai Chi community and those interested in dance improvisation always come. Roger: Boston and New York City that's of vital interest to a lot of people in general, so with that in mind I put out information to the dance community, to doctors, to the athletic community, and to special interest groups. It's also a good idea to contact people in neighboring cities so you don't have to generate the whole market from your one area. You can collaborate in terms of a series of workshops or one big wor:kshop for several cities. Ellen: It also cuts transportation costs for teachers. Dena: In one case a \"special interest\" group saved us from a disaster when \"' ~ ..c u 0 0 ..c 0. tion is not safe, people who might be interested in the work may not come. A high profile place attracts more students/audiences. How much do people in your area know contact and the particular person you are sponsoring? When Steve Paxton came to Boston there was a real interest not only from Contact people but from people who were interested in dance in general. Whereas, when Andrew Harwood came, although I knew he was a great teacher, no one had ever are much different. The Contact community is very small relative to the dance community. So for the sponsor it's really a matter of reaching out to the public and selling the teacher. Peter: You have to go beyond the Contact people to those not regularly engaged. For example, when Beth Goren came, she did a workshop called \"Balancing the Body/Mind\". Now Andrew Harwood and Mangrove \\vere following on each other's tails. What we thought of, with Mangrove in town for only three days, was to have them teach a men's class and tap the gay and \"masculinist\" communitv.

We've relied mainlv on word-of-mouth among the dancer~. other fringe artists, psychologists, and friends of friends of friends.

    "Text": "Beyond the Rambling Rolling Rut by Kris Wheeler The following is a collection of scores designed to encourage range and skill with creative process while involved in contact improvisation. Creative process is the essence of improvisational artistry. It taps the intuition and is therefore able to embrace great quantities of information, and to perceive simultanegusly patterns and relationships of many dimensions-rhythm, poetry, design, imagery   Dancers, especially those with no other movement training than contact improvisation, seem to limit their movement material and restrict their contact dance to a narrow range of possibilities. Rather than shut out the reception of info~ation we can allow our intuition to absorb and play with choices of a wide variety of dimensions. When first becoming aware of and expanding the range of our moment to moment choices, we can find ourselves intellectually deciding the · future. This interferes with the intuitive choice process. Let it be a phase to pass through and emerge with more awareness and greater participation with the totality of the moment. The Content of the Dance, the Emerging Elements Two people beginning in physical contact, dance. (Later they can begin out of contact.) When either one notices an emerging idea, it is announced and both explore it as the source of their dance. It needn't take longer than one minute to announce an idea and it can be anything from the specific to the abstract, (e.g. slow, in and out of contact, balancing, bubbling, I support as you fly, \"Rock a bye Baby,\" spinning   ). The dance should be at least a five minute exploration of the idea. If the other dancer doesn't understand what was said, or doesn't see how it fits, that person says, \"I don't get it\" and the dance continues until another idea is announced. This is to keep from trying to recreate what is already in the past. and the circle can announce what is perceived as the movement idea to be used as a source. Each time a new dancer joins a new idea is announced. (It is interesting to hear the circle's observation of your movement.) With time, more depth and subtlety will develop in observation and vocabu• lary-at about this stage dancers are quick to perceive the potential of their movement material and the announcement will be superfluous. Stillness: to Clear the Space and Frame the Dance, or Beginning and Ending First work with short solos-1 to 3 seconds in length! Clearly establish both the beginning and the ending. Ask for feedback from observers about their perceptions of exactly when ~d with which part of the body the dance began and ended. Two people work together, starting out of contact, finding their own individual beginning, spending some time in physical contact and then finding their own individual ending with whatever seems appropriate. It is important to recognize and stay committed to the ending moment. Eventually the dancers become more perceptive of each other and their interface so that the dance seems to determine the beginning and ending. The Line The part of the dance between the beginning and the ending can be thought of as the line. The line represents the flow of the dance; anything from the sometimes local develop• ment of an idea to a series of chaotic and random events. Some improvisational lines work and some don't (and some work for some people and not for others). The point is to be aware of the line, or the flow of the dance, in order to more fully participate in it. In a round robin, both the dancers In groups of 3, two dance and one watches. A short dance at first, 2 to S minutes with clear beginning and ending. Eventually work toward much longer dances that hold together as a whole. After each dance spend some time with feedback and discussion. How did it hang together? Did it end too soon, chopping off the line? Did it ramble and not utilize the opportunities?   Uniqueness of each Dancer After dancers have grown more sensitive to their partner, their sensitivity can be interwoven with their own unique creative process: Two dancers start individually-simultaneous solos, time to gain a sense of their own dance; at some point they come into contact and work with maintaining their own individual line as well as creating the duet. Eventually they leave physical contact to find an individual ending. ~"

    "Text": "DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IN CONTACT by Keriac Until I wrote this article, I hadn't realized how many different directions I've gone with Contact in the past year. All of these experiences are united by one personal goal: I'd like to contribute to the development of Contact as a folk art, a meaningful art activity which ordinary people do for pure enjoyment in the normal course of their lives. I wantto be a dance teacher/performer within a community of people who may have chosen not to dance full-time, but still retain a sense of the dancer in themselves. I've been reaching out to people who might not otherwise think of getting into Contact dancing, even if they should have heard of it. I've been contacting: with Seniors   I did a Contact workshop with SAGE, a senior citizens group in Oakland, California. When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find all the senior citizens and social workers lying on the floor of a plushly carpeted living room, each with their head on someone else's belly, laughing hysterically. Naturally, I immediately joined the fun. As I led the group through contact exercises, I noticed a nervousness in myself. I feared being out of touch with the stamina and flexibility of older bodies and the degree of risk appropriate to older people. The possibility of injuries floated up into my mind. However, this group responded to the same exercises that I use in my regular classes with only slight modification, and I soon felt at ease. I stayed primarily with exercises that did not take the participant very far off center, but by the end of the session, we had even gotten into weight taking, and the only person who had dropped out was an 83 year old woman who had recently broken her ankle. As the two hour session was coming to an end, I found myself doing active-passive duets (I was the active one) with one person after another. Everyone around me began claiming, \"I'm next!\" \"I'm next!\" It was fun. Every single person danced a duet with me, even the woman with the broken ankle. These older men and women let me balance them in the air on my hip or back without clutching or showing any signs of fear. They melted into the floor and took my weight with just the right amount of active-passive involvement. I was amazed-we were really doing contact! At our final hug, everyone was incredibly high, including myself-despite my sweaty exhaustion. As I left, I overheard them saying that they wished the experience had been videotaped so that I could be shown at an upcoming Senior's conference in the Midwest. Gray power is powerful! with the Blind   I also taught a series of classes at the Lighthouse for the Blind this last year. There were six students, some were senior citizens. Within this particular group of blind people, there were multiple handicaps. Some were mentally retarded or psychologically disoriented, some had excessively tense, rigid bodies, one was obese, one had a fractured collar bone from a recent fall, others had arthritis, diabetes and other conditions which made them short of breath or easily dizzied. I altered my class goals, deciding to use contact as a movement therapy tool rather than as an end in itself. We spent about an hour on warm-up and relaxation, then spent the last hour on contact exercises. Since I couldn't just say \"Do it like this\" and then visually demonstrate the activity, I was forced to describe many sensations that I experience in Contact with precise language. This was a major challenge for me and I learned a lot about Contact in the process. Using Contact experiences to improve the student's real-life functioning increased my awareness of how really beneficial and healing Contact is. I feel incredibly enriched by the luxury of my present Contactor's lifestyle which includes so much touching, trusting, and ease of movement. Since classes at the Lighthouse have come to an end, one of the visually disabled students (without other impairments) is now attending my regular class where he is much in demand as a Contact partner among the other students. ~"

They explore the parallels between physical dynamics in Contact and psychological dynamics in relationships, highlighting the concepts of assertion, manipulation, and the \"rescuer-victim-persecutor\" triangle.",
    "Text": "with Therapists   Teaching workshops for therapists with my sister, Ilene Dillon,-who is a therapist with a private practice in Marin County, has also increased my vocabulary and awareness of Contact as a therapeutic tool. Ilene immediately recognizes principles of assertion at work in the dynamics of Contact interplay. Her theories on manipulation are amply illustrated in what makes a Contact duet work or not work. It seems that the same laws which are operating on a physical level in Contact activities are also operating on a psychological level in relationships. Vocabulary used to describe emotional realities has a very strong impact when one senses that it is also true on a literal level when one dances Contact, and vice versa. Bruce Dodson, a member of the \"Issues in Radical Therapy\" newspaper collective, and I co-led a Contact session at the Radical Psychiatry Summer Institute at Fort Mason this year. Here the language and emphasis differed slightly from Ilene's, but it seemed that Contact also fit in well with the Radical Psychiatry point of view. I found it easy to communicate the notion of giving body surface to case a falling person's descent (rather than grab them to try to keep them from harm) to people who were already familiar with the concepts of the \"rescuer-victim-persecutor\" triangle (when a person tries to 'help' someone by 'taking care' of them, they create a victim who will later resent\"-persecute] them for it.) In other words, the person with the problem should have control of solving it. My communal family and I attended the Summer Institute together. We have started using Radical Psychiatry techniques in our emotional sharing meetings and our personal lives. It has helped us achieve more intimacy as a group, and a better clarity in resolving conflicts. It feels good to sense the harmony between the principles used in my family and emotional life and in my dancing."

    "Text": "with Communes   The Communal Grapevine, (a network of communes in the S.F. East Bay) invited me to lead a Contact session at their monthly potluck gathering. Over 40 communal houses belong to the network. It seemed like all 40 of the households were in attendance. The very large living room of the host commune was filled to the brim with people ready to experience their first Contact session, and beyond their heads I could see many others pouring in the front door. This was a greatly diverse group, ranging from early teens to seniors, and encompassing a wide variety of lifestyles. For some, it was clear that Contact teetered on the edge of what was sane and/or respectable behavior. But an \"I'll try anything once\" attitude prevailed. About a quarter of the group was still dancing two hours later after hungrier companions drifted off to sample the temptations of the pot luck. By then we were involved in pretty athletic movement and the decrease in density gave us room to move safely. At the end, the diners and dancers re-grouped and discussed values of interdependent, cooperative, trusting, and responsible interaction held in common by Contact Improvisation and communal living. Several communal houses invited me to come to their regular house meetings to lead their family in an evening of Contact sharing. I accepted. For some houses, this meant the first breaking of an unspoken taboo against physical contact among the house members, and caused a mixture of anticipatory excitement and apprehension. So far I have not heard of any resulting orgies fulfilling anybody's worst (or best?) fears after indulging in the communal contact sessions I have led. Some of the communards in the East Bay wanted more Contact than a one-shot family meeting. At the time, no one was teaching Contact in the East Bay, so I started a class which was held at Berkeley Moving Arts and then later at the Dwight House commune. It was attended primarily by members of three communes although publicity eventually opened it up to others as well. (Historical note: I began teaching Contact more than two years ago in much the same series of events. First, just a weekly sharing session with my communal family in our living room. Then my family began bringing their friends, the friends brought their friends, and soon I was putting up posters and teaching four classes a week in the Walkabout studio in San Francisco.)"

    "Text": "in Community performances   This summer, a small loose group of contactors calling ourselves \"Public Works\" met informally on Sundays in Golden Gate Park and performed outdoors for the crowds lined up waiting to get into the King Tut exhibition. I initiated this project, modeling the structure on a street performance group of which I was a member five years ago. \"Public Works\" differed from the earlier group in that we used props rather than white face to provoke curiosity and we did Contact Improvisation rather than theater. Wearing construction worker hats and bright orange T-shirts, and surrounded by our props, which included road crew pylons and flags, plus two sawhorses stenciled with the \"Public Works\" logo over the bright orange stripes, we evoked the image of workers doing street repair. The dancing started with high energy jumps and lifts, and the contact duet movement was amplified with hand-held road crew flags. This was the most effective way we found to attract attention and gather an audience. \"Public Works\" participants agreed it was an interesting experiment. We plan to revise and recycle it after the rainy season is over. This fall, I've continued my exploration of Contact as a performance form with the advanced students in my regular classes. ] oe Dowling, Robin Snyder and I recently gave a Contact demonstration and performance at the Noe Valley Public Library. Conditions were difficult: a cold, linoleum covered concrete floor in a small room with low ceilings. A party with a live band was going on in the room above us, and our space was the only access route to the building bathrooms. However, we had a capacity crowd of enthusiastic people who joined us in an hour of Contact experiences, watched our Contact performance, and then eagerly participated in the question and answer period. The physical limitations • had not prevented us from turning people onto Contact.

    "Text": "Q &A by Steve Paxton \"What is Contact Improvisation?\" That the question is asked reveals either that the term is investigated by people with no opportunity to see performances or jams by contactors; no recourse to social dancing, a friendly wrestling match; or, as in my case, too much exposure to the above. When, in 1972, a group of dancers began work on Contact Improvisation, it was a study of the way communication was possible through touch. My own background was mostly the Modern Dance, which may be seen as a study by individuals in physical isolation, usually within a group. In classes of this sort one maintains a sphere of isolation from other students to avoid belaboring them with battements. Crossing the floor, it is customary to move serially, enabling the instructor to see each student as they pass. From this background the communication possible through touching was, and still is, a profound experience. Likewise the movement which resulted from contact improvising-a non-rationalized, intuitive movement leading to unforeseen phrasing, positions and gambits-was a relief from years of willful technical applications. Although improvisation has long been a sophisticated approach to music and, more recently, to drama in the U.S., in my background it didn't exist. Although there were many references to improvisation as an impor.tant factor in the development of modern dance (Isadora Duncan and Rudolf Laban,) by the time I came to study, Modern Dance seemed in a period of codification. From the many 'mainline' modern dancers with whom I studied, I can recall only classes full of rote exercises. This state of affairs is so contrary to the spirit of Duncan or the ideas of Laban that one might suppose Modern Dance had been born and died during the first half of the 20th Century. Yet the term 'Modern Dance' holds promise of renewal: it seems less useful to limit ~"

He emphasizes that it is not a form of set movement phrases but an approach to movement driven by reflex and intuition, warning against a purely technical approach that can hinder the dancer's evolution.",
    "Text": "LETTER FROM STEVE PAXTON TO THE CRITICS in England Totnes, Devon March '80 the phrase to a particular period than to presume that the name, phoenix-like, can rise from the ashes and become again applicable. In this interpretation it becomes an umbrella for avant-garde efforts of any sort, which is more or less the situation I encountered. From this perspective, basing movement upon intimate communication (rather than aesthetic dictates) was appealing. It spoke to my body, which had been in isolatiori for many years. Having found the phenomena, the next step was to select ingredients in preparation for the extremes of movement the communication could produce. Aikido, gymnastic and meditation techniques were included, and material gleaned from the contact improvisation itself. It was here, I think, in the effort to create a technical approach to insure greater safety, that misunderstanding of the form was born. Many folk who are drawn to Contact Improvisation to explore their physicality, will begin the practice willfully, trying to 'understand' and move intellectually (as is their habit) instead of exploring willingly. For some of these students, the techniques suggested by the teacher become doctrine. They 'know' what Contact Improvisation is because they remember the words and perform the techniques. I believe there is no form of dance for which this approach will liberate the dancer. Certainly not Contact Improvisation which is not a form of set movement phrases but an approach to movement in which the student moves from the motivations of reflex and intuition. There is a contradiction in a technical approach to improvisation. While one is aiming for a freedom from rationalized movement, one is still studying movement from the example and words of a teacher. Ideally, each student would move at their own rate, developing physical skills appropriate to their own improvisational explorations.

    "Abstract": "This article reflects on the Judson Dance Theater Reconstructions and the early days of Contact Improvisation, highlighting the resistance to solidification and the importance of ambiguity in keeping the art form alive.",
    "Text": "Seven days after the Judson Dance Theater Reconstructions at St. Mark's Church and the event seems a thing of the past. More so, even, than the original events done in the '60s. It was a little bit like seeing an old family photo of an event that is indelibly etched in your memory, but when viewed directly seems very far away. The event is more clearly gone, but even so, the memory remains current. Maybe that's because a memory, as it's carried through time, can change, and adapt to the new time. Though memories tend to slip away when they're no longer relevant, fixing them extinguishes their fire much sooner. I'd never been to Judson, and I was glad to see the 17 reconstructed works, but I was not nearly as filled with the spirit of Judson in the '60s as I had anticipated. I feel the spirit of those times best in the sense of humor, support, and challenge that I've witnessed between artists whose friendships were forged in that period-the permission to undermine one another, in fact the hope that if one got too comfortable, someone would pull the rug out from under you and set you spinning again. And so it is ten years since the first public performances of Contact Improvisation. People are talking now of producing historical Contact Improvisation events, writing books about Contact, and this issue of Contact Quarterly is Cl's 10th anniversary issue. At least one baton that seems to have been passed from the Judson world of the '60s to Contact in the '70s is a resistance to being solidified-the sense that to stay in one place too long is to freeze there. But whether you stay or go further, a \"place\" has inevitably been cleared by your passing, and that point of reference exists. Every day more trails are blazed to, from, through and around that place, with other landmarks forming along the way; and so it becomes increasingly difficult and in fact pointless to fix its outer limits. There does seem, however, to be a center-a downtown, as it were-to this sprawling Contact metropolis. But that center isn't exactly on the map. It's more implied than stated, suggested by the overlapping spheres of experience that the work produces. The activity of Contact itself is remarkably straightforward and recognizable, but the experience of it is relative. An atmosphere of curiosity has made the work a currency of exchange rather than a place to go-awkward for those who had expected to someday arrive somewhere. The way is the going itself; we remember what we are left with, but not always where we left from. One night at the Vermont Movement Workshop in Putney a few summers ago, about 50 people gathered for a discussion about Contact. No particular subject was slated. So, we started from scratch and asked, What is this thing called Contact Improvisation that people are so hot to do?, What is it? Some people said it was about communication, a code of sorts; others said it was about sharing weight, getting a rigorous workout, acquiring new skills, and others said it was about developing sensitivity. And the list went on. After the discussion, on our way back to our rooms, a few of us were walking past a cabin where some of the students were living and I heard through an open window as we walked past, \"They know what it is, but they just won't tell. That Steve Paxton has passed on a legacy of ambiguity that keeps everyone from saying what it is, but they know.\" I laughed when I heard her, but I've thought about what she said a lot since then. And I think she's right. Not only did Steve offer a dance, but a built-in way of keeping it alive. Thanks, Steve, for that one. Nancy Stark Smith April 25, 1982"

    "Abstract": "This article, reprinted from 1975, discusses the early days of teaching Contact Improvisation, emphasizing the importance of communication, generosity, and responsibility in passing the form along to others.",
    "Text": "[C.Q. Vol I No 2] Stinson Beach, California, 1975. I began a fall series of classes (\"Contact Improvisation-The Art of Controlled Abandon\") September 1st [1975] at Cat's Paw Palace in Berkeley, meeting twice a week for 21h hours in the evenings. Only now are things really starting to click, ideas and relationships popping into perspective. Contact Improvisation is an awareness, internal, and of the immediate environment/situation, but that's only half the story-rapport and communication follow. Hence this letter and the newsletter it is contained in. But there's more to it than just communication, with only that it's boring. It's the giving behind it that catches people's interest, the generosity that allows them to give too. That's the form \"give weight\", \"take weight\"; sharing is it. We have been throwing back and forth in the \"core group\" talk of people who wish to teach contact before we feel they are ready, and what to do about the situation. Obviously communication is the first answer and this newsletter the first solution. But in the future, to take a serious responsibility for the Form (Contact), to see that it is passed along to others well, we need to be more generous of ourselves, in terms of time and involvement so that our students can·be fully immersed in contact for a good solid period of time and realize the responsibility before being carried away with the desire to teach. Possessiveness with the form only causes people to go off and do it themselves or \"teach\" their friends. I also feel the need for developing some kind of cross-pollination between the major groups in this area (Bay Area). Some students just can't get enough, so if one person isn't teaching or not frequently enough we can refer over to another class. We need to provide enough \"Contact\" situations for people who are really hungry, to be immersed in it for a good amount of time. I have finally accepted the idea that the only way to be accountable for the form is not to be possessive of it and try to control it but to be generous and open, with the form, showing a sense of unity between us core people, rather than having/ showing. A lot of this has come out of long discussions with Nita [Little], and Nancy [Stark Smith] in the last month. Also I have talked it over extensively with Margaret Fish~r, and tonight I had a long talk with Byron Brown who I invited over for dinner. . Concerning my class it has been going well. I've been learning at least as much as my students, and that's a lot. The beginners were really beginners, and the form has a lot of material to work with. The class over the last two months has been 95% women and not as consistent attendancewise as I would like. I feel that familiarity and friendship/committment amongst the group is a very important factor. I guess that's the way it is here in the city. The biggest challenge has been working with people who aren't very aware to begin with of how they feel or how a duet feels to them, the challenge is to get them to feel something and to talk about it. For the most part sessions are energizing and time goes very fast for all involved. I look forward to more sharing and work and accept· ance among the core contactors. Sincerely Love, Curt (Siddall)"

    "Abstract": "This article presents a discussion between Keriac and Mark Pritchard about the values and political implications of Contact Improvisation, including its relationship to the white counterculture, its emphasis on equality and self-responsibility, and its potential as a folk art form.",
    "Text": "Values KERIAC: Someone at the seminar on politics in FOCUS '78 in Berkeley, my first Contact Intensive, postulated that perhaps Contact is what we white liberals need to make ourselves whole: it balances us. Other cultures have not deprived themselves of touch and the rest that Contact provides, so they don't need it as much; they need other things. MARK: In what ways does Contact fit in with tbe values and needs of the white counterculture? K: Contact is concerned with intuition, aesthetics, physi· cality, \"being present in the flow.\" That's definitely \"counter\" to the mainstream culture's emphasis on rationality, intellect, status, and achievement. I'm a third generation Contactor: I learned about Contact not from the originators, but from their students. I keep thinking of questions I'd like to ask the originators, because I'd like to know if some of the political implications that I see in Contact are just my own projections, or were the values of my teachers, or actually came from the originators themselves and were consciously intended to be a part of the work. For instance: why was this form named Contact Improvisation and not Steve Paxton Tech· nique? In the entire modern dance world, every new approach except Contact is based on a cult of personality: Graham technique, Cunningham technique, Hawkins technique, etc. The Contact originators probably proceeded into this name very naturally, without even think· ing about it. But to me, that name is revolutionary-it reflects a whole new value system in dance. M: What was this value system? K: A notion of equality among people working together, without stars. I understand that Paxton was a teacher at Bennington at the time he began exploring Contact, and that his co-workers were mostly students. And yet, if two people try to do Contact while maintaining the typical student-teacher relationship, I think those two wouldn't end up doing much Contact at all. Both the name and the form itself assume that Contact is a collective creation that is bigger than individuals. There is a letting go of ego, and a letting go of traditional role expectations, that is unprecedented in dance. Effort-Shape work is another approach to dance that is not called by the originator's name. But Effort-Shape is based on an amazingly thorough and rigorous analysis of movement by Rudolph Laban. Laban's contribution was essentially intellectual, and the dancers who made use of his theories contributed the physical application that is now referred to as \"Effort-Shape\". Contact is essentially a physical manifestation. Have you ever struggled to define Contact? Every time someone asks me \"What is Contact Improvisation?\" my mind goes blank, even though I have carefully read and studied many written definitions of CI trying to prepare for this inevitable occasion. I invariably end up demonstrating physically. I think the best definition of Contact is \"that which happens when you do Contact.\" We can extrapolate theories from Contact, but what we have been given is a physical legacy. l remember that Laban's theories had a similar impact on my dance work as Contact has had. It was a joyful release from the mind-set: \"the correct way to study dance is to memorize and duplicate the movements of a famous dancer.\" This method does give you the advantage of learning someone else's lifetime of bodily insights, but whose body? Laban's work outlined the basic principles of dance design much as the Bauhaus has outlined the principles of visual and three-dimensional design for visual artists. It gives the dancer a choice of the whole universe of dance material, not just the iota that one famous person has dedicated his or her life to. That way, each person can choose the iota that best suits his or her own temperament, which is likely to produce a much more deeply felt commitment to their work. The result of freeing dancers from the master-apprentice model will be a lot more diversitv and creativity in dance. Contact also frees dance from 'the master-apprentice model. A maxim I picked up from my Contact teachers: \"The dance (Contact) is the teacher.\" M: In what other specific ways does Contact reflect a new value system? K: Well, take the notion of taking responsibility for yourself, which is a big lesson to be learned in Contact. In Transactional Analysis there is a concept called \"the rescue triangle\", containing the roles of the victim, the prosecutor and the rescuer. According to this schema, when a person tries to \"help\" someone else by \"taking care of her'', they create a victim who will later resent and persecute them for it. The way to avoid this dynamic is by not doing more than 50 percent of the work. To do more is \"taking over\" someone else's problem, and laying a subtle power tnp. In a Contact duet, you only do 50 percent of the work: you 're simply responsible for yourself. You are empathetic with your partner, in some situations you even extend help to your partner, but you do so in a way that doesn't take over the duet or solve what is basically your partner's problem. Giving body surface to ease your partner's fall, rather than grabbing your partner to \"save him\" is a prime example. In a Contact duet, each partner takes assertive actions, but each does so in a way that leaves choices open to the partner. When you jump on a contact dancer, she may roll out from under you; she may choose not to take your weight in the way you predicted, and that's part of the dance. Contact makes an important political statement about relationships-about what is my responsibility, my territory, my decision making power; and what is yours. n with Keriac and Mark Pritchard San Francisco, Summer 1979 Folk Art & State Art K: I have a pet theory I'd like to throw out, based on Curt Sach's book World History of the Dance: Art can be divided into \"Folk Art\" and \"State Art\". When ballet began, it went like this: all through Europe there was folk dancing; each village had its own dance. Dance had a real function in the ordinary lives of ordinary people; it was for weddings, funerals, religious festivals. It was for marking passages in individual lives and for coalescing a community spirit. It was inherently participatory. Political power in Europe was scattered in fiefdoms among many nobles. Then one of those nobles became more powerful than his neighbors, took over the lands around him and became king of that land. The King brought the disenfranchised nobles to his court, and absorbed their power. At court, the nobles didn't have anything useful to do; society life took over-dances, parties, social events. For entertainment, peasants were brought in from the country to demonstrate their dances. The nobles watched, the peasants danced. The nobles applauded the highest jumps, the fanciest turns, the flashiest costumes. Technique and showmanship became the content of the dance; Dance became a performance art. When the dancing was over, the peasants were given a good meal and sent back to resume their work on the land. One or two peasants, the ones who had been the most amusing to the audience, were asked to remain at court. These few spent their days refining their technique, giving performances and teaching dance (it became fashionable for nobles to learn the peasant dances.) The art of the King's dancers gave the King power over others, in the same way that the King's stable of fine horses added to his status and power over others. As long as their ballet continued to awe the audience, the dancers did not work at crafts or till the soil; they ate at the King's table. They were professional dancers. I have told this story as though \"State Art\" only arose in Europe, but I believe it has happened all over the world. \"State Art\" is characterized by an emphasis on technique which is mastered by a dedicated few, who then are watched by an audience. It is inherently elitist-a few talented people are given the resources necessary to support their artistic growth on a full-time basis; their achievements are then used to enhance and increase the status and power of the aristocratic patron who has the wealth to pay the bill. It is characterized by competition between artists and between patrons, by separation of performer from audience, by its emphasis on style rather than spirit. \"Folk Art\" is characterized by its accessibility to all people-the steps are simple, the spirit in which you do it is more important than virtuosity. It is non-professionalyou kick your heels in the village festival, and then go back to your survival support~ng work t?e next day. It is participatory-it's your weddmg, your life happenmg through the dance. You do not dance because you have to, you do not dance for someone else's pleasure, according to someone else's standards. You dance by your own choice, for your own satisfaction and because it co~nects you with others. There is no applause, the reward ts the dancing itself. Contact as Folk Art K: I see Contact as a folk art, with folk art values inherent in the work. Its basis is kinesthetic, rather than visual. The dance unfolds from giving primary attention to the bodily sensations of the dancer rather th:in from atte~ding to how it will look to the vi~wer. I~ ts a cooperative, connecting-to-others form. While dancmg Cont~c~, y_ou exist in the present, from moment to moment-it ts literally your life in the act of living. The context chosen for Contact activities at its onset reflected folk art values: no stage lights, no costumes, no proscenium stage, \"performers\" would grunt, groan, talk casually to each other, talk to the audience, quit dancing abruptly. Conta.ct \"performances\" frequently seen:ed like. a commumty gathering in witness of an event m the lives of the performers rather than an entertainment for the audience. The weh-established phenomenon of the Contact Jam is unique among modern dance activities: the jam is n~t a class to learn better technique, not a performance to impress . . others, it is dancing for its own sake, and a way to socialize with your community. M: That may be the way Contact was performed and practiced at the beg~nning, bu_t th~t doesn't seem too descriptive of what is happening right now. [Note date of interview-Eds.] K: True. Contact performance groups are showing a trend toward incorporating \"State Art\" values into the work. Take Mangrove as an example. They s~ill perform. most of the time with simple lights, no proscemum stage, mformal atmosphere. These are all anti-elitist elements. H~wever, Mangrove has steadily increased the!r use of the~tncal elements blended into the contact, which makes this essentially participatory form more \"performance. orie~ted\". Now they are blending choreographed material wit~ contact as well, and also including modern dance techmque and \"theater courses as part of their workshop classes. M: What political implications does this have? K: Bringing folk art values int~ a perform~nce situation and making it work is a revolut10nary act, m my book. It not only re-defines what is possible to be performed, but also fundamentally alters our perceptions of interpersonal and power relationships. Are we (as audie~ce member~) stand-ins for our aristocratic predecessors, mtent on bemg entertained; are we stand-ins for our peasant predecessors, witnessing a community ritual; o~ is this new perfo~mance mode actually building a new societal structure which does not presume class division? Traditions M: There are now individuals and groups doing Contact who not only perform for money but who are supported by grants. K: Right. They're doing a form which is anathema to \"State Art\" values, yet they're plugging in to state support. Revolutions are not necessarily what will earn a living. My intuition is that Mangrove and _other grou~s like them will have to make some concess10ns to traditional values in order to survive professionally. If you try to make your living as a performing group, there is pressure to fit into the traditional _mold. The pressure. does not only come from the outside, but al.so f!o~ within. As performers, we naturally w~nt to ~amtam ht~h standards and communicate effectively wtth our audience. Our internalized sense of what is \"good quality performance\" is largely based on the previous model availabl~ to us-\"State Art\". This model has also shaped the audience's expectations to such an extent th~t the public may not be able to perceive your work at all if you do not conform to tl}e assumptions and values expected. M: It seems as if there is a set of considerations, in traditional art, that people think validate their dance, such as working with a teacher, preferably a well-~nown one, or an established choreographer, or an established ~ompany. Also: working on specifically choreographed pieces. Doing performances that resemble traditional ones. Going on tour. Doing publicity. Applying for grants. K: All those things validate your dance. But what di:> they validate? Your technical competence, not your creative skill. My technique was always lousy, and I w~s more interested in creative work. I wanted to create first, then develop my technique to get under it. But th_e oppos"

    "Abstract": "Steve Paxton reflects on the principles and techniques of Contact Improvisation, particularly the act of falling and adapting to variables of distance, position, and direction. He emphasizes the importance of timing, preparation, and trust in the body and the earth, as well as the role of muscle memory and open-mindedness in navigating physical interactions.",
    "Text": "I am examining the passage from up to down. I look at the range of the passage, from the small dance of standing, to the linked falls of walking, to swoops and dives from high points on other bodies. With experience, the act of falling has come to include an ability to adapt my body to the variables of distance, position, and direction and to intuit which part of my body will take the first moment of impact. The first part of my body that touches the ground I can use as a lever. By extending to that part, I can unify limbs and torso to prepare a sequence through which to smoothly transmit the energy of the fall, and my weight, into the floor. Within the brief freedom of the fall, my body can convert a sudden accident into a controlled descent. The result of so many changes in spatial and kinesthetic orientation in a short time has caused me to perceive space as spherical. The sphere is an accumulated image gathered from several senses-vision being one. As if quickly looking in all directions gives me an image of what it might be like to have a visual surface all over my body, instead of skin. The skin is the best source for the image, because it works in all directions at once. If we could turn the skin off, we would appreciate it much more. But the skin works most of the time on automatic pilot. The conscious mind is alerted if unusual stimulation appears on the surface of the body, but, I don't notice the touch of my clothes or my weight in a chair most of the time. In Contact Improvisation, however, I find I am hanging by my skin. And relying on its information to protect me, to warn me, to feed back to me the data to which I am responding. We are looking at material from 1972, training for the first performance of Contact Improvisation, at the John Weber Gallery. It was a hot New York City day, but everyone seemed game. What can be learned by catching a hurtling body? The importance of timing. That there is such a thing as a correct preparation. That understanding the technique with the mind is different than understanding with the body. That momentum can be extended and used once the initial impact is absorbed or deflected. Or that the seemingly impossible juxtaposition of a small woman catching a large man has possibilities-most of them leading to the floor. But that is reasonable. Trying to stop or hold too much weight is dangerous. The idea is to discover what is simplest to do. In a state of trust of the body and the earth, we believed we could learn to handle the forces involved in physical interactions between two people who permit each other the freedom to improvise. The first instant of any fall is crucial. At that point a roll may be prepared. If the preparation isn't made at the first moment, falling takes place without guidance from the faller. What can a body do to be safe? Commitment to something which isn't happening is a barrier between me and my body's circumstance. Memory of past judgements tells me that prejudging is not secure. And memory cannot function consciously because at these speeds I can't think my way to safety. If thinking is too slow, is an open state of mind useful? Seems to be. I remember deciding to learn falling skills, which have become muscle memories. I figured my chances of survival were greater with these skills than without-an assessment of things to come. In this way, prejudgement and memory do play a part in what is happening now. Although adults and children fall at the same velocity, adults are more liable to injure themselves because their mass is greater in proportion to structural strength. It is possible to develop responses to deal with this safely. Slides, rolls or full surface landings, which spread the impact of landing over as much of the muscle area as possible, are useful in Contact Improvisation as they are in the martial arts of Japan. I am concerned with the possibilities of guiding the momentum of the fall away from collision with the floor or partner. A body could endure for decades. I don't want to injure joints. On the other hand, shouldn't focus on doom. Can't exclude fear. Efficient falls tend to turn into slides or rolls, transforming vertical momentum into horizontal travel. I may find a last minute leverage from my partner to enable me to land upon my feet. My fall might be guided so it spirals around the body of my partner. Thus, a fall starting on the downward path can be guided into a circle orbiting my partner, and finally, its momentum used to aid in regaining a high perch. Contractive energy or tensions overpower the sensing of subtle movement, and so gravity is masked. Relaxed is almost right; but, flaccid is wrong. In exploring the small dance of skeletal alignment while standing, I am sensing subtle falls of parts of the skeleton. One thing is clear. I have little memory, muscular or mental, of what I've danced. The specific movements my body executes when I improvise do not register consciously, and I can't reconstitute them. I feel transparent in the action. Causing it only a little, and holding no residuals. ~"

    "Abstract": "Randy Warshaw discusses the evolution of Contact Improvisation techniques, emphasizing the importance of physical safety and sensory education for students. He reflects on the balance between teaching specific skills and fostering personal exchange and improvisation in the dance form.",
    "Text": "As the sixties gave birth to new ideas, the techniques of the seventies evolved to provide tools for applying and teaching those discoveries. When Steve Paxton invited that first group of people to perform contact improvisation in 1972, he had no technique for showing them what they would be doing, or how they would do it safely; but he did have a group of gifted athletes, people with strong physical backgrounds, that could do potentially dangerous movement with minimal risk of injury. Starting with that solid physical base, they developed a movement form that was at once both spectacular and imaginative. As contact began to be taught, physical surity could not be assumed. Over the last decade, a comprehensive technique has evolved whereby students can very gently be introduced to the range of physical states encountered in the dancing. Moments from the dancing can be extracted and introduced to students in a controlled and structured setting. Because of this, it has been possible to teach people of greatly varying physical abilities complex physical maneuvers. The capacity to teach skills and develop physical range and confidence has made contact improvisation highly accessible and attractive. It's provided the necessary and important function of laying a solid foundation for full and open improvising. In contact improvisation, the senses need to be educated. Disorientation must become an acceptable sensation. A released body, supported in length, can be developed. Trust, patiently nurtured through confidence and familiarity, prepares the way for diversity. Through trust, awkward, uncomfortable moments of vulnerability and powerful moments of virtuosity become equally rich. When I began teaching contact, I wanted to pass on to others the simplicity and accessibility of the form. As teaching material, I chose those skills which I had been taught and felt confident and competent in. I found it possible to teach others to do them also. I got a lot of satisfaction in seeing my students develop abilities to soften, to roll, to give and take weight in diverse situations. But after several years of teaching this way, I began to feel limited. I felt that in teaching skills I was operating within a very finite field of experience. Though I was approaching what I considered to be the heart of the dancing, I wasn't quite there. Who was it that said there were 87 million permutations in contact? Well, I felt up against those permutations. It might take a very long time to find and teach all those permutations, but all I would be teaching was permutations. It wasn't quite the dancing. \" It became burdensome to stay at least one step ahead of my students, each week coming up with new things to do. They were all learning lots of physical possibilities, types of physical moments, but.week to week I felt weighted by the task of finding new combinations for them to experience, weighted by the dependency that kind of teaching fostered . . Developing skills is a necessary part of teaching and le~rnmg contact. But there's a danger in making these skills overly precious. It's important to remember that skills are meant to introduce types of experiences that may be encountered in the dancing. What is found in that experience is the important thing. It's important that students notice their growing acceptance of disorientation, their a~areness of the body's ability to organize and take care of Itself, ~he trust and confidence they gain in themselves and their partners to stay with a moment, and meet the needs of each changing moment. Too often, though, stud~nts focus exclusively on mastery of maneuvers, challengmg themselves with more and more complex maneuvers as ~heir confidence increases. Mastery of maneuvers can be important in gaining confidence, but I think it's more important to take that confidence into the dancing than to take the maneuvers. It's the orientation towards a higher and higher refinement that runs the risk of distracting students from the opportunities for a more pers?nal exchange with their partner. The subtleties of any given moment can so easily be buried beneath the execution of that next move. When people like Steve Paxton, Lisa Nelson, Daniel Lepk?ff, and Nancy Stark Smith were performing and teachmg regularly, there seemed to consistently be new, good dancers emerging through contact. A couple of years ago a lot of g~od teaching and performing of contact dropped off (here m North America). Perhaps this was due to the fact that many of the early pioneers of contact had fo_und a fullness and maturity in their dancing that they wished to apply to other areas of interest. It seems natural to_ me t~at eight or so years of attention to any one thing will begm to call forth derivatives. Maybe, as contact had established itself fairly solidly at that point, a new freedom existed wherein they could let go of its nurturing. Also, as contact was just beginning to catch on in Europe, there was the need for teaching and performing there. In the absence of these dancers, I thought two things happened. First, many people who had been doing contact for awhile mistook these people's change for a change in contact imp"

STILL MOVING by Steve Paxton Cynthia Hedstrom is leaving Danspace (at St. Mark's Church, NYC). She has directed its use for three years and created a center in which the dance culture of Lower Manhattan moved and thrived. The space is one of the desirable venues for dances born in loft studios. The proportions are larger than the usual studio, but intimate enough to convey the sort of non-theatrical detail frequently laced through new dance work. The floor is hard and fast. The audience sits on carpeted steps under a balcony on three sides of the room. The upper area serves for lights and video/photo documentation. High above the floor, the ceiling vault is a great curve which caps the air lightly and elegantly. Susan Milani and Alan Gardner photos by Steve Paxton Carol Mullins does the lighting and Dan Froot coordinates other elements: sound, slides, films and sets. This team handled the many details, changes, complications of CONTACT AT 10th & 2nd with care and efficiency. It is something of a test to produce new works and improvisations because much remains unknown, untested or mutable right down to the wire. A tight, light, responsive system is invaluable for breaking new ground. However fine and airy the space itself may be, it is this team which made the house comfortable for the several dozen choreographers and performers who gathered there for 7 productions June 10, 11, 12 & 16, 17, 18, 19, 1983. The performers and choreographers had a great deal to pull together themselves. They arrived from England, California, Canada, the US, and from around Manhattan, with their concepts, improvisations and dancing bodies. They arranged themselves into the general format of Contact Improvisation or Choreographed/semi-set works with minimal ado. As (traffic) director of these events, I am eternally grateful for their grace under fire. • Contact Improvisation has been a performance form since its inception. Audiences and critics have challenged the appropriateness of this decision, and I think it true that the audienceperformer relationship may serve the performer here as much or more than the audience, certainly for those observers who require more explicit signalllng of intent in their audit. Their expectation is a rather fruitless approach to Contact Improvisation. It is, after all, improvisational. Intent and manifestation amount to the same thing. Further, any contact duet is a manifestation of a fraction of the possibilities of the form, so, audiences seeing a performance for the first time must be content with the specifics of that dance, if not the general idea. Much that is excellent in Contact Improvisation is the result of omissions-avoiding injury, for instance, yet allowing moments of instability while playing with powerful physical forces. Omit jarring the body, miscommunication, physical confusion, willful accomplishment. These omissions are about survival. Survival may be taken for granted by audiences. The performer of CI is not so phlegmatic. The notion that CI performance is 'ungenerous', as audiences have observed, results from CI performers paying close attention to life and limb. If the audience feels neglected due to lack of eye contact, for instance, they might consider that in CI training peripheral, non-focussed vision is employed. This is very awkward socially (try it at a party) but creates a state of mind in which vision is not paramount, for once, in the sensory spectrum of the performer. Mass is therefore more clearly sensed, as is positioning and change. Audiences of televised sports are accustomed to seeing athletes preparing for their tasks, and watching them work (play). These performers are primed to make unusual efforts and we watch the results of their play knowing what they are attempting to do, and, with some, we understand how they hope to do it-an empathy born of knowing the rules of the situation. I believe knowing the premises of CI creates a similar empathy, but the spectator must become used to the idea that a Form which is proposing to deal with improvisation formally, rather than being goal-oriented or aesthetically based, requires some other sort of empathy-perhaps that of the naturalist on a ramble. It is the mi.turalist who organizes the view into forms. The river will not speak of gravity n·or surface tension nor subsurface currents. These are attributes for the naturalist to infer. The birds signal their intent to the other birds. The naturalist is eavesdropping. Birds just bird. The naturalist must bird along. In short, theatrical forms rely mostly on contrast and conflict. CI depends on communication and cooperation. Sports rely on conflicting goals and 'plays'. CI has no point-system and the maneuvers are relatively unpredictable. Fred Holland & Ishmael Houston-Jones, June 1983 Dance has visual aesthetics, Cl has accepted a much more 'general look'. It just happens. Its subsurface currents must be inferred. I suppose we are asking audiences to look in unusual ways, but what of that? Every medium requires a shift of focus, every culture. Even every day. I would like an audience of Sherlock Holmeses who would discern the interpersonal currents, understand the dialogue, and maintain a stance of no blame, even in the face of the guilty performer who could not fulfill his own idea1s in performance. I gather from what I have written that I do not see the audience-performer relationship as one where the performer has a duty to the audience. I see it as a relationship where they have a relationship with each other, and if the audience may have expectations of the performer, well, so may the performer have expectations of the audience. You no doubt get the drift. \"It matters what you give an audience to do\" (Christie Svane). \"Art criticism is for artists as ornithology is for the birds\" (Barnett Newman). • Two works from CONT ACT AT 10th & 2nd, one of the semi-set variety, the second improvisational, remain especially vivid in my memory. Fred Holland and Ishmael Houston-} ones performed a gritty duet which segued seamlessly from contact to conflict to contest; through emotional areas into clear physical spaces; to sense-altering moments when the two bodies seemed to drag or claw through space; to events of high play, and casual conversation. Nothing settled as the dance progressed. It was one fevered long transition. It spoke of men, Blacks; they were at war at play at art at odds at one. The space was used darkly. A sound score of soulful mechanical grating and chugging added emphatic menace to some moments. The same sound, more frequent toward the end of the work, became a wash of rather loud pulsations, but were merely background noise when I perceived two men working in a factory. The throb of sound was hypnotic, and I had a feeling of falling back and forth through time, from the present moment of contact to several apparent references in their/our past: scrapings from old newsreels, late night TV wars, items in smoky bars. On the Saturday night of the second weekend, 5 folk who teach or perform contact in Lower Manhattan did an amazing thing which I have not heard brought up for discussion, though if there is orthodoxy in improvisation, this performance was a challengegauntlet down from the git-go. Looking the length of the space, I saw the lights come up on an Indianfile of performers facing right. The leader whirled and slapped the second across the face, which turned the second around to face the third; 2 slapped 3, 3 slapped 4, 4 slapped 5, who spun completely around and returned the com"

They describe a workshop they co-led, exploring how movement and physical interaction can help individuals understand and address psychological issues. They advocate for the use of Contact as a form of body therapy, particularly in cultures that tend to neglect the body.",
    "Text": "In July of 1980, Rita Ossi participated in a contact workshop with me in Venice, Italy, for rehabilitation therapists and others interested in Contact as a therapeutic matrix, and thus began a fruitful collaboration which continues to enrich our respective fields of interest. Rita was then doing psychotherapy for a public health service, helping long-term patients become autonomous and reintegrated into the society. What most preoccupied her about these patients was the sense of expropriation that their bodies had suffered, the lack of care for themselves physically, and their fear or inability to adequately relate to others. She found that only by direct means and experience-body work-was it possible to improve their self-concept. As Rita continued to study Contact with me in Rome, she found the concepts of Contact Improvisation startlingly powerful (even if some she had previously encountered in Reich, Lowen, Perls, and Feldenkrais): establish contact with yourself and others, turn yourself upside down, feel weight and energy, perceive and occupy space, give and receive weight (physically and psychologically!), understand where the fears knot up inside. Each of us from her own starting point was convinced of the therapeutic value of contact. So last summer in Treviso, we held a workshop together. Most participants said that their primary reason for wanting to experiment with Contact was to widen their movement experience. Little by little as we worked, we noted that everyone found the work psychically therapeutic also. The workshop begins. After a brief introduction, I start some Contact exercises: with the floor, with various body parts, with space, weight, with another's body (with and not against). It is for them both an exploration and a discovery, a putting into focus, a union and a clash with their own sensations and postural habits. We go on to balances, somersaults and other upside down movements, feeling weight and energy, trying active and passive roles. There are moments when people seem confused because they are feeling new sensations, coordinations never before explored, relationships up to this point barely recognized; and there are other magic moments in which the movement flows as dance and everyone perceives the fusion of mind and body. When someone in the group encounters an apparently insurmountable difficulty, we stop. I try diversi:: physical approaches. Rita mentions the symbolic significance the movement might express, the psychological valence of that individual or group difficulty. She tries not to be categorical but proposes various hypotheses, interpretations which each can then investigate for himself. She gives some examples: not being able to give one's own weight or take another's may mean lack of confidence, fearfulness, mistrustfulness of others, rigidity in relationships; holding the head and neck stiff perhaps means wanting to control everything rationally; holding the legs, especially in couple work, could mean fear of sexual invasion, etc   Memories of old traumas arise, consciousness of habits (postural and psychic) taken on at particular times in one's life, fears that have never been overcome. When, on the last day, we put together sound and movement-roaringthere is a moment of panic. Broken, held sounds come out and they suddenly realize that these sounds open a new realm of the body. Eagerly and at length they work on the impasse. At the end of every day, Rita and I discussed the work accomplished, in what manner each participant had shown us something of himself. We examined our impressions of their personalities, their problems. The following day I proposed exercises relating to what had emerged, integrating this work into the general development of the workshop. And so the workshop was guided by psychological as well as physical considerations. The therapeutic effect was confirmed by the participants themselves in our final discussion when they talked of their sense of well being and physical pleasure, and also of awareness, each at his own level, of \"dark areas\", of the lack of acceptance of parts of their bodies, and of the possibility of accepting those parts and better integrating them. Rita and I had decided not to comment specifically but generally, to allow the experience itself to bring eventual insights. Rita has been able to verify, even in other situations, that the discovery of certain personality disturbances, if it happens in the body, with its own reactions and sensations, is more quickly recognized and can provoke more radical changes than an analytic psychotherapy based exclusively on words which often mask, color, and dilute significance and change. Certainly Contact is a dance form, full of life and expression, but we maintain that it can be used also as an efficient psychotherapy, or better, as \"body therapy\". Both in Italy and America where present physical fads tend towards negation of the body rather than self-discovery, we would like to see Contact better known and used. f! I would be very interested to know if and what anyone else is doing with the therapeutic aspects of Contact work. Irina Harris, 516 Nordhoff Dr., Leonia, NJ 07605."

    "Text": "Time's up. Now words must reach the paper. Highlights. It's history-no fancy anybody's moving around like they owned the world. We owned the clock on the wall; we owned the gold in our teeth. The sun in the morning, the hot steam in the air, the hot sweat on our backs-we owned it. We owned the day before and the day after. We owned the color green and the color orange and all the blues and the color black. If my language offends you, forgive me. This is an ex-marxist speaking in tongues. Anybody home? It's good to get turned around, to get turned upside down because maybe for a little while you don't remember where you are ie. disorientation. I never counted who cares how many so many dances all different dances. I remember my black eye but not how I got it only that it felt (how should I say it)-earned. Not a day went by that I didn't refer to a poem I'd been working on. No matter how many times I tried to rewrite it, the beginning few lines always came up the same: Dance/ a million laughs for El Salvador/ for god's sake/ Someone dance. I'd started it many weeks before when someone I know was dying fast :ind was waiting on what? I a miracle. And really I had never thought much about miracles since, well, hebrew school in N.J. The light burning on Hannukkah was a miracle when one day's worth of oil in a burning lamp lasted an entire 8 days because someone with a fast horse and a few extra days to spare took a chance suspended his imagination and against all odds traveled to retrieve more oil. Before the jam, the poem had seemed vague and simple and incomplete. Five days later, without changing even one word it seemed to take root as a poem for the first time. Before the jam, my words seemed to belittle the very serious political and social aspects of the war in El Salvador but as I began to let go of the poem much in the same way as I began to let go in my dancing the actual meaning of the poetry became more clear. Dance/ a million laughs for El Salvador/ for god's sake/ Someone dance The current trend bespeaks the mood/ Bread and more bread/ and more bread Noone is alarmed at nature/ Midwives slap each grave image Sweat and muscle culminate beyond what waits A broomhandle blooms/ and winks"

They explore the concept of boundaries in body therapy, particularly with drug addicts, and pose questions about how contact dance can support psychotherapeutic processes.",
    "Text": "Dear CQ, After I read the article by Irina Harris and Rita Ossi, \"Contact as Therapy,\" in the last CQ [CQ IX 3, Fall 1984], I felt encouraged to write to you. This year I'm finishing my studies in psychology in Heidelberg and for 2'h years I've been doing contact improvisation and dance therapy. My interest is to integrate contact dance into my studies. Experiences you can have in this kind of dance, like flow of energy, weight exchange, the falling, trusting, flying,   will extend both your physical range of possibilities and your personal growth as well. At the moment I'm working on the conceptualization of boundaries/limitations in body therapy with drug addicts. First I'd like to introduce a little bit of the psychological thinking, which is very much based on Gestalt therapy, before I come to my questions about how contact dance might support a psychotherapeutic process. · From the psychological point of view, ego-boundaries are seen as constitutive [sic] for the ego, as a place where the identity of one's self manifests. Boundaries are the points of contact. It is like a membrane which allows a certain interaction between an organism and the environment, a point of contact where energy passes through constantly. Exploring your boundaries, your points of contact, you experience yourself, your ego, in relationship to the other. The ego is existent through the contact point and defines the boundary between the personal and the unpersonal space. Contact at the boundary creates a sense of independence and isolation, and at the same time it is contact and a possibility to share. This dualistic character of the contact at the boundary is necessary for the development and stabilization of what is called identity. Because of its importance for personal growth, you have to care about the very complex concept of boundaries in the psychological field. Sometimes you have to support people to build up (ego-) boundaries, sometimes you have to support them to become less rigid and more flexible at their boundaries or to rediscover the functions of contact, so that they can develop more ego-strength, autonomy and responsibility, etc. At this point, I'd like to find out how contact dance might support this psychotherapeutic work. In contact improvisation, the point of contact is a basic principle, first of all on a physical level, and for me, it always has to do with exploring and experiencing boundanes and limitations. The body 1s the pnmarv boundary between inner world and o~ter world ·and a manifestation, a personal system of what I am. I'd like to look at contact dance for a while in these terms and I'd appreciate very much, if anyone would like to respond to my following questions or share their experience in another way with me. I hope my GermanEnglish is understandable. Thanks a lot to Bob Rease and Robin Feld, who encouraged me during the August Summer Intensive in Heidelberg to come out with my interest. e What kind of boundaries do you experience doing contact dance? How do they manifest? • What kind of boundary-experiences do you have in relationship/interaction (in a duo, trio,   group)? -physical level -emotional level @ How do you experience contact at the boundary in terms of: -in between space (Zwischenraume) -surface-contact (Oberflachenkontakt) -full weight exchange (Gewichtsaustausch) What kinds of experiences do you have dealing with boundaries in terms of: -respecting boundaries/limitations -breaking through boundaries/ \" -protecting with boundaries/ \" -going beyond boundaries/ \" What kind of support   and   What kind of demands   do vou need (from the teacher, from the group or environment), to have boundary-experiences?   to be able to extend boundaries? • Other associations, thoughts, fantasies on this theme Best wishes, Gila Albers Kuhlhof 24 4450 Lingen/ Ems 1 W-Germany"

    "Text": "Dear Nancy, I appreciated your Editor Note last issue, \"Dealing with the Heat,\" {CQ IX 3, Fall 1984], because I too, have begun to see value in the friction of opposition. I have felt my tendency to harmon_ize conflict in so many aspects of my life, from social interaction to simply how I reside in my own tissue. And lately, I have been exploring in both my personal life and my dancing the parts of myself that I had dismissed by omitting 'no's, by resolving differences rather than feeling the heat of the friction. I perceive that there is so much ~o be gained in this exploration and thmk that it applies to much of what I have experienced with Contact Improvisation. To engage in conflict one must be willing to draw upon the passionate charge that emanates from one's \"guts'', tapping the heart of the matter. I am only beginning to appreciate the value of this juice. I have avoided it out of fear of sounding unreasonable or being too ego bound. Now I see it as a beautiful force that can orient me toward knowing-viscerally-my sense of purpose. I see the basic aesthetic of Contact as one of merging with natural forces, going with the flow, and experiencing union with both our partner and a process of engaging the physical laws of nature. Asserting control, saying n_o to this_ union, or establishing a distinct self m the dance is generally not done. As we continue to explore the mysterious beauties of the original aesthetic, I'm curious about how Contact will change if we bring more of ourselves to the dance, if our relationships include difference and separation as well as union, personal passion as well as the impersonal play of weight and balance. I see the orientation in Contact Improvisation toward harmony and process as an important voice on a leading edge of our culture, evidence of something more spontaneous and essential in dance and relationships than the superficial and goal oriented nature of much of our world. And I see the incorporation of conflict and passions as an important passage if Contact is going to continue to be a valuable social force. In order to discuss this point and to offer a perspective on Contact Improvisation in relation to our culture I'd like to share some of the work o'f Charley Johnston, M.D. He is a psychiatrist with a recently completed book, The Creative Imperative, about a model of all creative processes, from artistic endeavors to the process of developing a relationship, to developmental shifts over a lifetime, to cultural change and the creation of civilization . . . He sees similar structural shifts through all of ~hes_e processes as they grow. Although 1t will be unfortunately oversimplified, I'll describe the gist of this model in order to offer a point of view on Contact Improvisation's relationship to our current culture and on Contact's own development. . The basic pattern Dr.Johnston ~es m all creative process, all of life, is from formlessness/essence/mystery into form/manifestation/materialization and then into an integration process that eventually embraces both the structure and the essence. In other words, ~rom oneness into twoness, from unity ~nto separatwn, from what is archetypically fei:male mto archetypically male, from universal and spiritual into material and intellectual; and then into inte~ratio~. He _divides these three stages mto five which I'll call: 1) Pre-stage, 2) Early Stage, 3) Middle Stage, 4) Late Stage, 5) Integration. I'll describe each stage with exampl~s o~ developments in an art project, a ltfenme, and culture. It is important to note that each shift into the next stage reflects a transformation into an entirely different paradigm or system of values. And each transformation is a quantum leap into a larger capacity for experiencing aliveness, for being able to handle and even enjoy existing amongst unknowns. Pre-stage This is a gestalting time, a time of unity, before one is particularly aware of a cr.eative direction beginning to differen t1ate from this womb of possibility. In a lifetime, it is prenatal experience and early infancy, when the child bonds with parent. Culturally, it is the time when life is ordered by connection with nature-a powerful and mysterious ~orce. One lived within the unity of tnbe which was inseparable from nature and her cycles. CQ/CI Sourcebook 101 Early Stage . The early stage is the time df inspiration, the spontaneous possibility of essence taking form, the first notion of direction in creating a work of art. It is childhood, a time of fantasy. It is the time when cultures moved from tribal nature to the sophistication we associate with the early Greeks, the Aztecs, and Ancient Zimbawe. Basically, life is still experienced as a mysterious force of which we are in awe and by which we are totally influenced. Many of the special beauties of Contact Improvisation are reflections of this stage. We dance with spontaneity and participate in an often magical process that is larger than ourselves individually. Culturally, this is a spiritual time. Zen emerged from a culture at this stage. Not until the next stage do we become more personal, more passionate. Middle Stage As the first shapings of inspiration take enough form, they begin to challenge their source, their essence, for attention and belief. Here, distinction Integration The next stage, integration, is reflected by the leading edge of our culture. The essence of this stage is most apparent to me as I think of those people who, as they age, become sagelike. They come to gradually encompass all of the stages-they appreciate the mystery of life as well as the passions while maintaining facility with the intellectual and material aspects. With a work of art, this is when the work is complete and the artist becomes separate from it. Even though you may have created it, it will be quite a while before it is understood. Now it becomes a distinct entity with the capacity to teach even you who created it. I see Contact Improvisation as an aspect of Western Culture's movement into integration. I think it emerged as a counterswing from the materialistic direction of our culture. It has served me well in this regard. It has given me a taste of community while all I had known was transience. It has taught me about shedding of ego to enjoy the dance beyond my control; there truly is something to be trusted as alive without willful effort to make it happen. These are rather foreign notions to the goal oriented lifestyle of America in the twentieth century. But what about the twenty-first century? Ultimately, integration is more than a counterswing. Contact rather successsfully synthesized the mysterious, the more unformed and core aspects of the early stage with the articulate, discerning, and mechanical aspects of the late stage. But in this time of overstated glory for the intellect, I see much more value in engaging the heat of difference than for ideological articulation. In the same way that revitalizing the teachings of ancient prophets has been so meaningful to expand our capacity for living sanely in these seemingly insane times, I think we have much to gain in reclaiming the personal juice that is a powerful part of the uniqueness of each of us. I am excited to experience the potential embodiment of the charge of passions in myself and in connection with Contact Improvisation as it grows with me and with all of us. What will these changes be? Thanks Nancy, for all of your work with the Quarterly and sharing your growing edge. Sincerely, Kris Wheeler Seattle, WA Sept. 21, 1984 drawing by Christina Svane becornes very important. But not for empirical insight-that comes in the late stage. Instead, attention goes to distinguishing right from wrong, good from bad. As a work of art moves into more formedness, the original source acts as a sort of quality control continually questioning the integrity of the emerging form. At the same time, the urge to form must continuallly forge ahead or it will be swallowed by doubt. In a lifetime, it is the time of adolescence. In the polarization of forces arises a personal and even moral charge, a strength to know your position and stand up for it. (Sound familiar?) In Western Culture, the middle stage began at the birth of monotheism and continued through the middle ages. A result of that time was the creation of polarized social roles, e.g.: aristocracy and peasantry, male and female differentiation, and Christians and heretics. If we create a context in our Contact Improvisation gatherings that encourages people to engage in polarized relationships, then I'd say that the development of Contact as a whole is moving from the early stage into the middle stage. In my recent past, I have felt that emotional tension was a problem in a Contact class or Jam. It is useful to me to see the value of this stage rather than worry about conflicts shattering the unified foundation we have built. Actually, participation in this realm can create a capacity to meet one another in more ways. Late Stage In creating a work of art, the late stage is the time when attention goes to detailing the form and polishing the surface, now that the original source has taken satisfactory shape. In a lifetime, it is early adulthood when one is more oriented toward establishing oneself materialistically in culture. With the age of reason and into the industrial revolution, Western Culture shifted into the late stage. The forces of nature no longer appeared as a threat as we separated ourselves and focused on our capacity to control our environment. We have developed elaborate structures both materially and intellectually. We live in a culture that is in the midst of this stage. Aspects of Con· tact certainly reflect it: we have a highly articulate language for addressing the skills of Contact-a surprisinglly mechanical language of weights and levers, when actually the essence of Contact is union with natural forces and diminishing our effort to control. 102 CQ;CJ Sourcebook"

    "Abstract": "Steve Paxton's \"Solo Dancing\" explores the interconnectedness of dancers with the floor and each other in Contact Improvisation, emphasizing mutual freedom, reliance, and a state of present-moment awareness.",
    "Text": "by Steve Paxton reprinted from Contact Quarterly, Volume II no. 3, Spring 1977. Solo dancing does not exist: the dancer dances with the floor: add another dancer and you have a quartet: each dancer with the other and each with the floor. In the United States recently a form of dancing has arisen which treats each dancer as a surface to be played upon as is the floor. Named CONT ACT IMPROVISATION, it resembles wrestling, the jitterbug, fucking, tumbling and juggling; yet none of these quite describes the other; and none quite describes this dancing. The physical part is best pictured in terms of spectrums of potentials: two people freely improvising movement using the floor and each other as surface rely on gravity as a constant; inertia into momentum as a variable; adamant (the floor) to yielding (skin-muscle-bone-total mass) as surface features; and the variables of Program from the 1973 Contact performances at L' Attico Gallery in Rome, Italy. give and take, ruled not by set roles for each dancer but by the understanding that each may change from give to take at any time. This brings us to the non-physical part of this dancing; the state of being or mind permitting mutual freedom, with mutual reliance. The mind is kept empty of preconceptions and memories; it is in the present moments only, meditating on the potentials and on the easiest paths in the energy construct which are available to both dancers: it is a state of abandon; trust in the self and in each other must be total. The ability to help each other and one's self must be ever ready: through constant movement one pursues mutual ease in constant mutual change. The dancer's weight is only his tq give; not to possess. The final factor here considered is time. The division of time into minutes and seconds perhaps clouds the view of time-as-flow: but in this dancing where units of time are defined by the velocities of independent and semi-indepen• dent masses involved in movement of and upon the two bodies, time moves as quickly as the dancers move: given a state of constant falling, the glands react as in those falls wherein time apparently stands still, and the dancers shift from our pedestrian concepts into a time sense allowing some controls in the endless chain of accidents they have provoked: that is the improvisation in which they make contact. 1:!"

    "Abstract": "Nancy Stark Smith reflects on an experience of \"doing\" her partner's movements in Contact Improvisation, leading to a realization of the limitations in her own movement vocabulary and the potential for exploring new aspects of time and personality in dance.",
    "Text": "Seven years ago, while doing a Contact Improvisation duet, I was stopped short by a movement I made that wasn't mine. \"Hey Lisa,\" I called to her from across the studio, \"I just did your movement.\" \"Let's see,\" she said, as I rewound my sensations and ' tried to do it again. Recognizing her idiosyncratic timing, she laughed and suggested I keep \"doing her.\" My partner was willing, so we continued as I tried to put myself in Lisa's skin, in her nervous system, and dance. Instead of my usual moderated flow, I jerked and flinched, turning abruptly, plummeting halfway to the floor and stopping, pulling my arms back like a chicken and making tiny darting birdlike movements at unexpected moments. \"Whoa,\" I said, wanting to stop, \"this is too weird.\" What made me stop was the eery sensation of being in someone else's body and in their time. My choices, reactions, directions and timings were totallly foreign to me, but at the same time very familiar. I learned them from dancing with Lisa. There are many ways to learn someone's dance. In this case, I learned it through the skin. Dancing in physical contact with a partner is a lot like putting your ear to a wall and having a conversation with someone on the other side of it. Like the sounds in the next room, your movements and your partner's are amplified by the contact, and very little goes unregistered, even if unconsciously. In Contact, skin to skin, weight to weight, you're moved by your partner's movements and in this way able to feel their reflexes, the rush and pause of their time, first hand. In Alexander Neascu's article in this issue, he talks of a new kind of time called 'internal time' recently identified by postmodern physicists. I think it might be this kind of time-one that moves according to its own intrinsic logic and phrasing, not according to the standard clock-time divisions-that is communicated during Contact Improvisation. In \"doing Lisa\" I was further struck by the fact that although these were all movements I could physically do, they were not ones I would ordinarily choose. I had been under the assumption that in improvising I was calling on any and every movement I could possibly make, but now I realized I was in fact doing a very limited and consistent range of movements, textures and timings. That I was, in fact, always \"doing myself.\" I found this a rather humbling and revealing discovery. Volume 11 1986 Looking back from here, the oddest part to me is how disappointed I was to realize I was only \"doing myself\" when I danced-as if I should have been able to do more. What more was there to do, one might ask. Well, Contact Improvisation for one thing. Obviously one can only do Contact, or anything else for that matter, in one's own way, but I was so busy looking at Contact Improvisation, I didn't notice myself doing it. I was too busy subjecting myself to \"the forces\"-of gravity, momentum, inertia, etc.-to notice what kind of subject I was. And I was taken aback to even consider it. Within the study of Contact, the experience of \"flow\" was soon recognized and highlighted in our dancing. It became one of my favorite practices and I proceeded to \"do flow\" for many years-challenging it, testing it: Could we flow through this pass? Could we squeak through that one, and keep going? I used to have a partner that I called the Flow Machine. His considerable mass streamed through the channels of movement, sometimes like a rushing brook, sometimes like molten lava, but always ongoing. I would get euphoric and giddy as the end of the phrase never arrived-always there was a new curve, and we'd bank off the edge of that one, going on and on. There is great pleasure in this. And it is in large measure through establishing and maintaining Volume 11 1986 photo: Bill Arnold a mutual flow that the trust is formed between partners which supports further risk-taking, as from this baseline one can quickly sense changes in the flow as they occur-changes in direction, modulations in timing-and be ready to adapt to them. The kinetic pleasures and soothing rhythms of time-in-flow can be hypnotic and often go unchallenged in Contact. Why rock the boat now that we've finally gotten it steadied? As I've said, I've always loved \"doing flow\" and still do, but the time came when I began to wonder what else was possible. What other kinds of time could be played out in the dancing, and where might that take us? What I'm finding is that it is there, in the departures from the established time frame, that new aspects of the dancers' personalities emerge and new risks are taken. Taking the lid off the flow container, time can move in new ways, reflecting not only the dancers' mutuality but their singularity, in time, and in space. Challenging any established order is a risk, and can come with a fair amount of disorientation and awkwardness. But Contact trains us so well in spatial disorientation-with all its whirling about, off-center and falling~surely our practice can welcome a little confusion in time as well.

    "Abstract": "The author reflects on teaching Contact Improvisation and the challenge of transitioning students from clock time to an internal sense of expanded time, emphasizing the importance of relaxation and absorption in the moment.",
    "Text": "For the last month I've been going down to Wesleyan University on Fridays to teach two l '12 hour classes in Contact Improvisation. Though I've been liking the students a great deal, I've been grumbling a lot during the week about the classes being too short. But now the grumbling is bothering me more than the shortness of the classes, so it's time to look into the whole ordeal. The whole ordeal is about time, not enough of it, or more specifically, not enough of a certain kind of it. When I teach beginning Contact Improvisation, there are a few principles I come back to over and over-some for safety reasons, others for flavor. Some have to do with expanding one's orientation to space-experiencing space as spherical, dealing with disorientation, being able to fall, roll, and ride momentum, alone and in physical contact with another mover. I suppose this could be called spatial conditioning. Then there's time conditioning, which I'm just beginning to take particular notice of. A lot of the meditations on physical sensation (e.g. Paxton's \"small dance\") that have always been a part of Contact training are actually as much about inducing an experience of expanded time as they are about the physical sensations they point up. This sense of expanded time is a subjective state, one where time feels mutable and there are slippages-where a 45 minute dance can feel like 5 minutes, while a 2 second fall can feel luxuriously long. It is a relaxed state, one where time seems to have been released from its inexorable unit-to-unit march and allowed to roam in an open field with wide horizons and no fences, a time whose divisions and textures vary according to the moods and perceptions of the people moving through it. As with spatial training, this new temporal experience may be puzzling at first. All too often you lose your place in the dancing, but you find out through experience that if you just hang on a few seconds longer (those seconds feel like hours!) your place will come floating up under you like 106 CQICI Sourcebook a pair of lost footprints. You come to trust and in fact look forward to those gaps because in them you 're as vulnerable and available as you can be, and from there come new perceptions and some of the more surprising and refreshing movement material. But how do we get there from here? Especially when we 're coming in to the studio from Chemistry or Shakespeare or Ballet or a 65 mile drive. The transition from clock time to internal time can begin during the personal warmup-a period of time often given at the beginning of class to relax and \"arrive,\" to get ready physically and mentally to dance with others. It deepens during the periods of extended duet improvising. Absorption in the moment expands the feeling of time and you come out of it enlivened no matter where you've been. It's this state of absorption and enlivening that I aim for in my own dancing and teaching. I spent the first few weeks at Wesleyan searching in vain for a quick passage, a trap door into this state. But how could I hope to transmit the spaciousness, mutability, and mystery of time when I myself was rushing to get in as much dancing, skills, improvising, sensitizing, etc. as possible in the 'short' time available? Exhausted from my struggle with time, I gave up and found that simply by relaxing I created more time. It felt like practicing Aikido, where one redirects an opposing force by first blending with it, not resisting it. Meanwhile, of course, as I was internally wrestling with all this, the students were rolling, giggling, getting dizzy, getting strong, confused, inspired, thinking it was silly, feeling it was profound and in general doing Contact Improvisation. As has often been said, the dancing teaches itself, if the teacher can only get out of the way long enough to let everyone dance   P.S. After all this, I still think an hour and a half is too short for a Conta"

    "Text": "SATURDAY begins with spontaneous warming up and dancing. The teaching exchange started with a discussion of areas where people wanted to work-personal experiments, ideas, difficulties, etc. We soon became involved in the subject of being in the air. . The initial question was how to use the force which takes you away from center (centrifugal force) to meet your partner again, and transfer that force into weight exchange? Here is an excerpt from the ensuing discussion: Nancy: Maybe there's another way to approach from the air that asks the other person to join your force-how do you join it, how do you read it so that you can work with it? To me it has to do with reading the movement before it gets to you so you can join with it. So coming through the air from different places, poses different problems to solve in terms of forces, momentum. Suzanne: How to stay flexible and open, to be able to read that movement when it comes with so mu-ch forc;e? Nancy: How to keep dancing in the air? People sometimes throw themselves in the air, and then lose their sensitivity while their partner just works with them. They are trying to hold themselves together in the air and that makes it heavy. They are not really there, they just want to get llld CQ/C/ Sourcebook down. Karen: The place where you are being supported is a little bit small, it's not like the floor   Mark: What about big men, I'm not used to relaxing in that position. Nancy: A lot of it has to do with if you're willing and ready to fall frum any height, because if you 're completely dependent on your partner or passive, you're in a funny position anyway. Karen: It takes time when you're up there to get used to that, too, and to try to fall, in different directions. Nancy: Also, when you're lifting someone who is big, to feel that it's okay to let them go, that you can start and follow through somehow without feeling that you have to hold them up there-otherwise you don't even stlut, cause you think it's too much. Moniek: One step before this   what kind of easy exercises can stimulate this process-like rolling-for people who don't have much experience? Nancy: Falling is good, because falling is moving through the air with gravity, and if people get comfortable with falling, on the other side of the fall is something that comes up. Falling gives you a force in an upward direction. It also makes you unafraid to go down. The down goes up and the up goes down, so if you can get the down part   Jaap: I'm interested in the problems of big men dancing with small women. When I'm going up I often feel the support collapses. Elinor: It's usually the men that don't want to give their weight to the women. They think they are too heavy. Nancy: Sometimes I find with heavier people who are afraid to give their weight, that they don't give their center. The center is off to the side so I can't get under it to support it and then they think, \"Yeah, see? Well they can't support me\" and so   they just keep the problem going. There are some men who are really quite large, and they give their center and the weight stays alive and even if it's a lot of weight you really can work with it a little bit. And they feel secure and you feel secure, which leads to less tension and thus more 'levity.' There's an exercise I do sometimes, it's a climbing exercise and if it goes slow enough you can feel and find your skeletal support. There's no momentum involved and it's not particularly light, it's quite heavy. But in the heaviness you find where the weight can be supported and how it feels. Then later when there's a little momentum it's lighter and you know where the places are, where you can go to support the weight (or be supported well). Mark: Even if I go up, it's already become a habit that I don't stay very long, so I never hang out there. Jaap: I'm finding out that it's not the point to stay very long, it's not the point that you're going up, the point is that you're moving and you happen to be up. Mark: But I'm talking about a technical level, as far as knowing what that is, to be suspended in the air. I know much less about it than you guys. Nancy: Maybe something to do is just hang out up there for one extra second. Again, it's like working with any --'* Volume 11 1986 limit-because it's a rhythm, up and down, up and down .. so you're just stretching or,opening the limit a little bit instead of 'how can I really stay so long' but just two more seconds and see what happens. Jaap: But there's one point-like when I'm dancing with Jaana for example, she's small, and when she's on me I have a lot of places for support, and when I'm on her she is really so small!! Nancy: People who are good supports really know how to use the movement continually for support as well as surfaces. There's really very little that the person up there has to do because there's so much riding the movement that's happening-with the little shifts to get around the shoulders, etc. Sometimes I really feel juggled by people. It's not 'cause they're strong but it's all the little stuff that they're doing. I want to learn to do that more. (To Karen) You work with a man about your size so you 're quite equal in your weight support, which is a great opportunity, because sometimes women don't lift small women either for very long, because they're not used to having someone up there very long. In the afternoon we had the actual teaching exchange. The mats were out and first Karen had us practicing Aikido breakfalls. Then Nancy led us in some light disorientation practice and we went on to jumping on people who were posts, approaching from the air and reaching your partner while still in that light state. During this session one question came up which seems essential to Contact teaching: When working on skills, does teaching specific movements or exercises have the same result as teaching a principle and improvising within that principle? How can you teach people to improvise if not by letting them find their own forms and ways to do things? Later on, Mark led a class which encompassed focussed duets as well as a dynamic group dance with brief and changing encounters. Focus: dancing with different people while still maintaining awareness of your original partner's center, then coming back to dancing with the original partner with an awareness of the group. Suzanne led an experiment which was about accumulating energy and force during a common stillness in the dance, while still in physical contact   until the accumulated force releases into movement through space. Later, watching \"Magnesium\" and \"Chute\" videos evokes a sense of history. Post-dinner networking discussion brings us to the publication of a European Newsletter and the setting up of a European Jam."

    "Abstract": "This article discusses the reasons for networking in the Contact Improvisation community, including sharing information about classes, workshops, and performances, organizing jams, and exchanging ideas about teaching and research. It also covers organizational agreements for a European Newsletter.",
    "Text": "What is the reason for networking? Needs, desires could be divided in: • To keep informed about the places where Contact is being developed: classes, workshops, performances, addresses, dates. • To know possibilities to meet and to dance with other Contact dancers. Includes: knowing places and dates where and when Contact is going on; organizing Jams in Europe. Mark Tompkins reported about the experiences with the first European Jam in summer 1982 in the countryside of Southern France, organized by L'Atelier Contact. Important points were the necessity of good space and sleeping accomodations; costs (admission fee to cover space and organization, then there's room and board, and travel cost at the individual's expense!). Suzanne, Jean and Joanna offered to set up a Jam near Paris around the 1st of May. • To exchange about teaching and research in Contact. Possibilities: To invite another teacher to your studio. To continue with this Conference once a year. Important considerations: Who will organize the next one? The necessity of good housing. Costs as mentioned above plus possibly the fee for inviting a special teacher (the presence, guidance and knowledge of Nancy was very inspiring and supporting). The length of this conference was generally considered too short. To deal with these aspects brought up the idea of starting a Newsletter. We should be clear about its aims: If it should be to inform each other in a central way; or if it should be a way of sharing experiences and exchanging ways of working. We ~ecided to choose for the way to inform each other, and to leave the sharing of the work to the Contact Quarterly. Organizational agreements: • Type your own letter (one page) with information about your teaching and up-coming events in your area. • Each time there should be a coordinator. • Two issues a year to coordinate with CQ deadline so it can be a part of the magazine. • Send money to the next coordinator if you'd like to receive a copy (or else it cannot be made and sent). We finished the conference realizing the NETWORK IS A FACT! -tt [More news from this Newsletter and deadline information for the next one can be found in the CQ Newsletter in this issue./"

It describes the feeling of being centered and steady amidst movement, and the importance of recognizing and accepting the truth of a situation to achieve control.",
    "Text": "I am in a form. A form of discipline. Focused outwards and inwards. Making connections, which make me to dance. I'm a mover alright. Eventually I'm moving the walls and the space between the walls. Me, as a centering organ, as a source of strength. (One powerful enough command and I would fly up, straight to the ceiling.) What I really do is hard to explain. I'm the centre of the space around me alright, and also of everything else, moving in that space. And it sometimes feels like it's me who makes it to move. I know of course, it's me who's moving, but something inside my skull stays steady, in one place, never shoving out of place   however much I'm going upside down, through whatever angles. In fact, the more angles I'm making, the more steady th is one part of me becomes. And the more steady this observing part of me is, the better I can make the world around me move. It's an interesting discovery. My body no longer distracted, because my organs no longer protest against every leap I make. There is an adjustment which makes it possible for my mind to follow the body, and for my body to follow the mind. Moving around I'm getting closer. Moving around I'm opening up. Getting aware of other people in the same space. Getting aware of other bodies (like mine, but different) moving around (but telling a different tale). Getting aware I'm actually moving in space which is shared by all the other bodies in the very same time. And by sharing this space, I'm sharing a conception. I'm sharing a movement, with every echo of it rolling between the walls of the space, wherein my body is responding, like a boat on the water. Effecting and being effected: my mind, with images. Mildly changing, disturbing changing, or however. My body, in the space. And some of the bodies around me, dancing. With the same mild flow or strangeness or confusion. However these waves in this stretch of time flow. And however much a mind is willing to allow changes to happen. My steady me is observing this. This part of me is the only part which doesn't let go. It's the part which must lay hidden in layers there are in my brains. It's a part which comes out on those moments/in those movements, when everything else is swimming in the stream. Comprehension. Understanding. Not the detail. Not the current. Not the face that expresses and reveals, but a sort of silent memo. A sentence like: \"I was still, no movement at all.\" Which is nothing more than recognizing a situation and accepting the absolute truth of it. Which means that on that moment, there is a balance of forces, focused on the moving body. And the observation of such is the key of control. Then my steady part falls back inside its hidingplace and there are only all of my senses left, sprawling in the dance. Dancing with other bodies, all in the same room. Space, time separating. An improvisation about survival. Going around somebody's back, falling down, head first towards the floor, rolling, jumping up. Waiting, out of balance. Being out of balance all the time. That's the essence of this dance form. Trying to cope with that which moves around you. Trying to grasp a shift of weight. Feeling the floor move away and around. Focusing eyes, sensing ears, balancing feet, flexing spine. Finding a way to the end of that rope. Landing on hands and feet. Feeling the ground getting to rest, while sitting. Waiting for echos to finally fade. Walls becoming walls and bodies becoming personal objects. A sense of distance restored once more  "

    "Text": "Today is my birthday and I'm sitting in my car, parked, with the engine running, outside our building, watching the shadow of the building rise on a high pile of snow as the sun goes down behind the building. Maybe sitting here facing this blank page is the closest I'll be able to get in writing to the feeling of improvising. Because how can you describe something that isn't there yet? I want to be able to write from inside the movements of an improvisation and tell from there how things look, how they feel, how they're going. But I keep finding myself back here walking the line, on the page, trying to make pens pirouette, words walk and ideas bounce and split open, like dancing can do. I'm impressed and informed by all the efforts evident in this issue of people putting a finger on what isn't there. It's like talking about a hole. In this issue, we're trying to say what shapes the hole from within. In the early '70s, when I was first getting immersed in the world of practicing and performing dance improvisation, I spent a lot of time watching the Grand Union• perform. For hours, I would see material surface on shaky ground, get nourished, worked, referred to, developed, and I'd see it begin to strengthen, come into its own, and become the ground for what would happen next. I saw material be given life or death (which in itself could become the next material), and I learned that there was, in practice, no inherent hierarchy of material. Every move had equal potential to unify, clarify, destroy, or transform what was going on. It was not just the material itself but how and when it was delivered that gave it depth and power. Where you are when you don't know where you are is one of the most precious spots offered by improvisation. It is a place from which more directions are possible than anywhere else. I call this place the Gap. The more I im• A Dance Theater improvisation group including Yvonne Rainer, David Gordon, Steve Paxton, Trisha Brown, Barbara (Lloyd) Dilley, Nancy (Green) Lewis, and Douglas Dunn. Volume 12 1987 Volume 12 1987 provise, the more I'm convinced that it is through the medium of these gaps-this momentary suspension of reference point-that comes the unexpected and much sought after 'original' material. It's 'original' because its origin is in the current moment and because it comes from outside our usual frame of reference. When Katie Duck teaches improvisation, as she has many times as a guest teacher at the Theaterschool in Amsterdam, she often tells people not to use their first impulse, but instead to wait for maybe the second or third before taking action. This ability to wait and not follow the impulse is a lot like learning how to break a habit. Holding the moment open a few seconds longer widens the gap where the old behavior/idea/movement/thought/ feeling would have gone. And maybe you have nothing to put in its stead. So you put in nothing. On January 28th, it was a year since I stopped smoking (and, coincidentally, a year since the space shuttle Challenger exploded). I never stopped before and the change feels enormous. Every time I want a cigarette and don't have one I'm creating a gap. Moments that once were easily and automatically filled, have become uneasily and consciously unfilled. By leaving them unfilled, I'm not only breaking a 'momentum of being', a pattern of behavior, but I'm bringing attention and charge to a moment that would have passed without remark. One of the things that improvising and stopping smoking have in common is that they both require an appetite for learning. Both have the capacity to take you to new ground. Both are about unconscious pulls and conscious choices, about reckoning with habitual perspectives and behaviors. Being in a gap is iike being in a fall before you touch bottom. You're suspended-in time as well as space-and you don't really know how long it'll take to get 'back'. And then, when you do finally get back, no one even noticed you were gone. Nancy Stark Smith"

    "Abstract": "This article explores the importance of awareness in Contact Improvisation, focusing on the \"Ready State\" and the process of deepening inner space to enhance outer expression. It discusses the stages of getting into the body, deepening quality, tuning sensitivity, and moving into exchange with a partner, emphasizing the need to be present and comfortable with change.",
    "Text": "by Chris Mathias The state or space created in the workshop setting decreases the stimuli of the outside world so that the internal impulses of our dancing can be felt, seen and acted upon. Once the outer arrangement has less of an influence, then the inner space becomes fuller, more alive and its range of possibilities become wider. The awareness of change in the inner space becomes vivid so that when the outer space of our world increases its influence, we do not lose the ground we have gained from the inner world. These statements were gleaned from a month's worth of writings, thoughts and discussions I participated in at Naropa Institute Summer 1986. However vague and general, they seem to apply to the state of mind we reach when awareness is brought to our dancing. During the course of the four weeks of Contact Improvisation classes taught by Nancy Stark Smith, we talked a lot about the \"Ready State,\" never actually defining it, but nevertheless knowing when it had occurred. There never seemed to be a standard way of preparing the body to dance, but one ingredient was always required. Awareness of body sensation, movement and body/mind states. Once in the \"Ready State,\" every part of our being participates actively. When not ready, some part of us hangs back, watches, refusing to participate, creating a rift within our own dancing and between us and our partner. 114 CQ/CI Sourcebook It seems that awareness implies action, and if this is true, then in the \"Ready State\" of Contact Improvisation we must actively know our sensations, movement and mind states. To know actively, or to bring awareness to dancing allows expression; the exchange of one body of knowledge with anoth· er. In my ignorance, I seemed to think that the \"Ready State\" was something to be achieved. A way of doing this was to identify the stages one might go through to reach the \"Ready Stire.\" They came as follows: 1. Getting into the body-requires a shifting of mind into bodily terms, i.e., sensation, imagery and movement quality. 2. Body time-now in the body, the action is of deepening quality. 3. Body Sensitivity---,body sensation and states of mind become finely tuned. The sensitivity to and awareness of body sensation and body minds is increased. 4. Body Expression and Exchangemoving out of inner sensation and into exchange with a partner. The body becomes the mode from which I relate. Although these stages offered some insight into the process, they also told me something about my ambition to achieve something that I thought was necessary. The \"Ready State\" requires only to be where you are, not where you think you should be. This slight shift means bringing an awareness to the changes happening in our dancing; changing and guiding the changes as well, so that the dancing becomes an exchange between the inner and outer impulses. This awareness is full bodied, the mind responds to the body and the body responds to the mind. It is a way of being with change. Being comfortable with frustration, ambiguity and basically not knowing what comes next. A way of being which begins without expectations of what will come, freeing you to be with whatever is occurring. In looking back at the time spent at Naropa, I see that we seemed to create a space for ourselves that aimed for freedom from distraction. We cleared and prepared ourselves to dance in the most honest way we knew how. The discipline of Contact Improvisation requires this clarity of body, mind and spirit, so that the person can deepen within the form and of equal importance, enjoy their dancing.{::{"

The quality of movement can range from light and feathery to heavy and nurturing, eventually bringing the puppet to the floor.",
    "Text": "Jonathan Smith I started the class off with unstructured solo warm up, asking for people to soften, and to move without working at it, and then continue in this mode into a slow duet warm up dance with the same qualities. The material that I presented was what I call the puppet-puppeteer motif. I developed this style of movement out of an image from a Robin Feld class working with manipulations. She was dressed in black and was moving a colorfully dressed person. I asked people to start off with a light touch, suggesting working the puppet by the upper body from behind, using the puppet's upper arms, or by pulling and leading from in front. The puppeteer does all the initiation; the puppet can follow through but not initiate. For example, the puppeteer can move the puppet's arm up and the puppet's arm can then slowly float down like a feather. Then the quality can get heavier, the puppeteer can bring the puppet into his or her center, taking more weight, nurturing and caring for the puppet; finally bringing the puppet to the floor, rocking it and putting it to sleep. I used this motif in a section of a dance that I created and performed in New York, June 1985, called \"The River of Cause (because because because because because).\""

In this setting the work was given range, depth, and focus-we experienced it as a vehicle of personal expression and development and as an influence in the structure of today's society.

    "Abstract": "Paul Langland reflects on his introduction to contact improvisation and its impact on his artistic development, comparing it to sculpture and highlighting its emphasis on process and democratic interaction.",
    "Text": "This piece was written in 1979. We discovered it in our files and found the issues in it still very much alive. We talked with Paul about it and be agreed. He also noted that shortly after this period, performances of improvisation in New York City seemed to disappear for several years. [Eds.] I suspect there are many people presently involved in moving art forms who, except for exposure to contact improvisation, would not have entered the field. My experience is a case in point. As an art major in college, I enjoyed creating large sculptural environments for the body. The weight and awkwardness of the materials, plywood, two-by-fours, and other construction hardware, turned building a piece into a physical work-out. Sculpting was an arranging dance, using the whole body. During this time (1973), Curt Siddall, Nita Little, Steve Paxton, Nancy Stark Smith, and someone whom I remember well except for her name [Karen Radler] came to perform and teach contact on the west coast for the first time. I danced some and watched a lot. The idea of people presenting natural movement as a performance was a pleasant jolt to me. The democratic give and take between partners was appealing. Improvising dance, creating while performing was, for me, a revelation. And my personality was more comfortable with the social circumstances of dancing than the solitude of sculpture. My first dancing was suffused with comparisons between sculpture and contact. It was as if the four-by-eight plywood sheets I had been building with developed power steering, and could even lift me off the ground. photo© 1978 Leslie Cerier The three-dimensional experience of sculpture became four-dimensional, the fourth dimension being the time of the dance. I was no longer the manipulator. For every impulse of mine, there was another independent nervous system deciding what was happening as well. I saw that contact is very purely about process. In terms of sculpture, that meant showing how fascinating it is to make a piece, rather than showing a finished piece. Through performing, I like letting others in on the creating side of the work, the side most interesting to me. Since that time, I've performed in many different situations; contact, other improvised structures, and set pieces. In watching dance or performing it, I'm drawn to dancing which doesn't impose a style on the people who dance. This may partly be a hangover from art training which encourages students to find an individual vision from the start of training. I'm glad this idea has a lot of credence in the dance world now. Improvisation is one way of working individualistically either in a group or solo. A problem is that improvisation and performance are sometimes friends. We all know of our on nights and our off nights. Those who perform improvisation have decided that the pluses outweigh the minuses. The pluses are that the dancers are presenting a raw slice of life, uncut, uncooked. The audience's position is elevated because they are allowed to get in on the whole story as it happens for the first time. They aren't watching something which has been edited in rehearsal. Improvisation is risky and often rewarding for the performers. It is a way for performers to move on with work, not to stick with an image or sequence \"What did you think of what you saw, asked Miss Stein . .. Only that Picassos were rather awful and the others were not. Sure, she said, as Pablo once remarked, when you make a thing, it is so complicated making it that it is bound to be ugly, but those that do it after you they don't have to worry about making it and they can make it pretty, and so everybody can like it when the others make it.\" Gertrude Stein which must be repeated several times. The formal qualities of contact make it a focused and grounded improvisational technique. There is a basic agreement between performers which provides a continual springboard into the dance. A performer of contact has a lot of freedom. I'm sitting here writing about how good a performance improvisation makes, and resisting tooth and nail the detractions. However, there are some. There is no overall structure to control the impact of the performance. It's like having several small dances linked together. Dull repetition can be a problem. When this happens, it's like watching the same rehearsed dance several times in one piece. This is one of the main limitations in previous dance work which many of us are trying to avoid by investigating improvisation. An ideal piece has few seams showing. There are a lot of ways to approach this, but they mostly have to do with pre-planning. It's difficult to achieve in an improvised performance. There also are some beautiful possibilities in pre-setting a piece; it can have long sections of synchronized movement, it can be a story, it can have special timing, or it can deal with the personae and not the personality of the performer. The search for these qualities is improvised but their presentation is, for the most part, set. Safety is important in contact. This results in contact being playful, game-like, and positive. There is a utopian communal quality to contacta great experience but not the whole picture. This one-keyed quality can be limiting for an audience, and make performing frustrating. There is little room to explore subjects like discord, tragedy, or events which are fantastic or grotesque. Sometimes I want to entertain/be entertained with these rich images. Sometimes I want the purity and abstraction of contact. When I perform contact, I like to feel that we, the performers, are sharing the performance with the audience. Among the most satisfying performances in this respect was a series done at the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York City [1978). We performed in the afternoon for three days, three hours per day. The audience was free to come and go. Those who stayed wanted to be there. As the performance progressed, the size and closeness of the audience increased. Neither the audience nor the piece was set. There was a cumulative effect from performing for a long time for three days in a row. Our dancing became very sure, and many audience members returned two or three times to watch. By the end of the third day we all felt like good friends. We felt like the home team. In the last year, I've been doing contact wearing different costumes. The costumes put a context into the dancing. Nina Martin and I did costumed contact as part of a living sculpture exhibit at the Susan Caldwell Gallery. Every half-hour or so, we changed clothes. We danced in pajamas, swimming suits, winter clothes, formal attire, and disco polyester. The costumes interest me because they provide a lasting image, however weird, of what the dancing is about. A subliminal story unfolded with each change. (Paul and Nina went to the prom all dressed up. They felt good and started rolling on top of each other. Nina's hat got squashed, so she _,. threw it away while climbing on Paul's back. They both fell into the buffet table, pensively. When the music started, Paul rolled up Nina's body and she supported him upside down with his jacket wrapped around his head.) Someone else may be having other daydreams as they watch. Our only plan was to do contact after putting on the different clothes, not to inject the movement itself with any plot or meaning. The dancing did feel very different each time we changed, mostly because the physical sensations of each outfit were so different. Winter clothes to swimming suits was a big change. As at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the audience could come and go. We felt very connected to the audience that stayed with us. Long performances are satisfying. We had a long time to allow the dancing to grow and change. Where we got the stamina tq do a three hour duet, I don't know. Solo space is something I want to see and do more of. It's a way for individual eccentricities to come out. Voice work, props, or other movement forms are possible without being filtered through that great equalizer, the contact duet. Contact ideas have been used as parts of different dance performances very successfully. Often I think of contact as a technique, or resource, rather than the thing to be performed. Here are just a few of the ways I liked contact being incorporated. In Simone Forti's Planet,.Terry O'Reilly and David Taylor did a low, slow, slithering contact duet with intermittent pauses based on reptilian movement while other animal-inspired dancing was happening at the same time. In Meredith Monk/Ping Chong's Chacon, Eli Pollock did a contact solo as the basis for his role as a drunken or crazy villager. Mary Overlie's The Figure has a section of \"spatial contact\"; dancing mostly without touching, but reacting to external sensing, and developing a flow with a partner(s). Last year, at the Contact Quarterly benefit in New York City, about twenty different contact pieces were shown. The variety was tremendous. There was a lot of experimenting and potential. Contact is democratic. Performers have equal opportunities in performance which, for me, is one of its great attractions. This equality shows in performance. The round robin form, and the freedom to start and stop dancing when you want is politically healthy for us humans. All contactors have a decision-making role as they dance, becoming their own directors. I have performed frequently in companies with directors, especially with Meredith Monk. What the director/company situation offers is greater specificity and depth of vision. The work process in The House (Meredith's company) is interesting. She frequently sketches out what to work on. We improvise and then set the most suitable material during rehearsal. Then work is further edited, or expanded and arranged with the other material in the piece. There are often sections of structured improvisation. In creating and performing, each performer has some responsibility as author, director, and actor. My thoughts on performance are open ended. Performing contact is rewarding, and there is an audience for it. It's reminiscent of a sports event minus the competition; the focus is on the moment to moment interplay of individuals rather than the outcome. A set piece offers other possibilities, both as performer and viewer. The two don't exclude each other. I hope the' multiplicity of performing possibilities continues to thrive and cross-fertilize. 1:: drawing: Margit Weichert"

Contact Improvisation is determined by two people at once, who both improvise freely, trying not to impede the work of the other.

The reasons for the change in scale of movement or any other changes can be analyzed from emotional, physical or psychological levels. ?r many levels at once. The spectator 1s watching real people pressed by events and time. It is improvisation. Neither participant is totally in or out of control. The spectator does not look through the performers to a mind and its aesthetics. One looks squarely at the performers and their choices, reactions, and instincts, to what happens between them. What is revealed is mutual understanding, a basic system, a mode of communication. Touch. The fast and subtle skin processing masses, vectors, emotions, giving the muscles the information to correctly move the bones, so the duet can fall through the time and space of demonstration, neither partner hurt, hampered, subjected, objectified.

    "Abstract": "Andrew Clibanoff recounts his experience at the California Harbin Hot Springs Contact Jam, describing his initial unfamiliarity and eventual integration into the community through shared experiences and movement.",
    "Text": "The first CALIFORNIA HARBIN HOT SPRINGS CONTACT JAM was real good. I hod a nice time. A lot of people come from where /live-the Bay Area-but some from Chico, one from Boulder and a few from other West Coast towns. Being a newcomer to the contact community, I felt unfamiliar with what a jam was supposed to be. You know, I hod read some earlier issues of CQ, taken a couple classes from N. S. Smith at Wesleyan U., even did some Cl in NYC at PS122. But, going away for a long weekend with complete strangers to bathe in hot pools and dance didn't exactly make me feel at home, or at ease. What was the purpose of a jam, besides a reunion for those who hod already been practicing the form for awhile? I could tell there were some of us who were new to this kind of situation and didn't know precisely what was going on. This initial awkward time reminded me of my first high school dance. About everyone agreed that music and dance should be present (but separate some of the time) during the weekend. A lot of us, including myself, were interested in not setting particular times for dancing and drumming or even bedtime. Someone remarked that the time might be felt organically. At first, not a lot of time was spent collectively breathing or arriving. \"Plunging in\" is what seemed to be the desire of many. Maybe the hot springs pools provided the springboard for this desire. I couldn't join the flow, though, because plunging in is a fear of mine. I needed to toke time to sit and think and tune into myself for what I wanted from this jam. We were in a completely new world at Harbin, a rustic 7000 mile woodland, mountainous tree-lined areas volleying and rising oil around our enclosed dance shelter. A small brook ran by with clear water from the Napa Valley (wine country here in California). But with oil that beautiful natural environs, it was still troubling to me not knowing the jam boundaries. What were the rules of the game, as they soy? I sow possibilities in group sex, a homosexual and heterosexual couples' scene, raucous contact, soft-eye dancing, rolling and breathing. All this stuff I felt Friday night or so. Then, on Saturday morning, things opened up. Some of the senior members of the group taught half-hour mini-courses in Contoctesque basics and new discoveries. I went up to the pools in the afternoon. It wosn 't so bod there. It was softer and quieter than in the dance shelter. Hazy and lazy, strong and light, mole and female, folks were just chatting and healing. Four of us novice con· tocters huddled our arms together in the pool and floated around like a spinning wheel. We talked about what we sow Friday night. To my surprise, we shored a lot of common observations. Then, we steamed in the hottest tub. We walked out ofter\\·ords, my bones felt heavy and my muscles suspended around my bones. On Saturday night, .the jam got together in a circle to discuss the moi•ement of the weekend. While people talked, someone tossed small coloriul ploybolls bock and forth in the circle. It looked like a game of marbles. You would toss a boll into the center and someone would try to knock yours out of the center and onto the periphery. Then, I forget who rolled herself into the center as a human marble. People giggled and rolled her around. Others joined her. That beautiful stock of 64 pillows by the \\·all become the next marbles, and a huge and monstrous pillow fight ensued. Finale: a dive bombing affair. Pillow rumble, it was real good. A lot of heavy stuff. Straight, bold and big strides over obstacles into the pile of tossed pillows. The rest of the weekend was fun. I think we, as a group of disparate individuals, discoi·ered our challenge: a common ground. I think we also discovered a commitment: on organic message. To me, it was on unfurling of the foll, a movement outward and down across the floor. As I spoke with someone on Sunday afternoon on the trail bock from our lost dip in the pool, I felt a return.

    "Text": "translated by Leab Jacob It is roughly 5 years ago that in the curriculum of the Modern Dance Department of the Theaterschool (TMDD) in Amsterdam, Holland, the subject of composition was replaced, without too much discussion, with the concept of 'improvisation'. It was not just a matter of altering the name, but a conclusion brought about by the department's gradually changing vision of the function and content of the process of composition within dance education. In the department's eyes, the con. cept of 'composition' had become too static a hea:ding to apply to a subject that actually is at the core of its teaching-the search for new forms. As it had recently been taught in our school, 'composition' appeared to take for granted a correct and incorrect way, a belief that compositional truths already existed. Thus, for educators, it seemed artistically more interesting to busy oneself with the process that leads to a form than with the results of a process undergone by other people at other times. 'Improvisation' as a concept, it seemed, (though we were at that point unable to comprehend all the implications), had more to do with this ex· plorative organic approach. In fact, in the course of time, it came to embody a rich variety of aspects and possibilities, challenging the whole teaching field with its far-reaching influence. Mostly as a result of Pauline de Groot's work, the department takes as its starting point the view that developing into a dancer means developing into an artist. This creative development can in no way be set apart from the young dancer's growing physical capabilities. This premise means that in every movement class the student is being asked to arrive at a physical shape by tapping his/her own creative resources, even in those classes where the movement form is provided by the teacher. The idea of making use of the student's own potential is in fact a very obvious starting point, but it does demand a certain attitude from the student, a state of being that is open. Especially in this area of attaining a 'state of mind' enabling further physical and creative development, a variety of improvisational forms can play an important role in teaching. The department views as a cohesive whole the making of work, the training that leads to this, and the person's physical/creative development. It is a complex process of growth, with the achievement of form through essentiallly investigative methods of working as its continual starting point. It is also true, within the process of composition, that methods arising from moving are more efficient and achieve more logical results than most that stem from a more static and dogmatic view of composition. Improvisation represents an approach applicable to almost every aspect of teaching: it is investigative; allows, while practicing, an overview of what is possible; and teaches one to make choices. This weaving of improvisation methods through the whole of teaching-across a much wider area than simply compositional techniques-has, in a way, led to some confusion: which improvisation methods should be employed, when, and to what purpose? The TMDD has tried several times to plan more effectively by drawing up a list of approaches and goals. These arose on the one hand out of the various approaches to improvisation launched, in a somewhat intuitive way, by the department directors in their choice of certain teachers over that last fe"

    "Text": "2nd European Contact Teachers Conference November 18-21 , 1986 Theaters.chool, Modern Dance Department Amsterdam, Holland Participants: Meret Schlegel, Christine Goigg, Doniel Trenner, Lindo Forsman, Jacqueline de Vries, Wolfgang Grof, Mork Tompkins, Howard Sonenklor, Moniek van der Look, Doniel Lepkoff, Andrew Horwood, Pierre Riou, Bob Rease, Pauline de Groot, Pierre Serophin, Suzanne .Cotto, jean Bloch-Laroque, Stephen Crowford, Lucio Walker, Koren Nelson, Alita Alessi, Bruno Stefononi, Elinor Rodeff, Margot Rijven, Nancy Stork Smith, Kirstie Simson, Renate Muller, Wolter Weiler, Cathie Caraker, Gonne Kooy1 Nien Mari Chotz The first meeting on Tuesday evening was impressive. After introducing ourselves and talking about the schedule (prepared by Elinor, Renate and Cathie, who had organ· ized the conference), we came together for dancing. I was happy in the very plain meaning of the word. Happy, because I could dance with people without demonstrating anything in terms of teaching, without thinking about the next step in leading a class. There is this underlying structure I am dreaming of, there is this language spoken so well, that you can make poems. The room was filled with the atmosphere of light and easy dancing. We began the next morning with a warm· up led by Nancy, focusing on the questions: What do I need to get ready to dance with another person? How do I know what? Do I teach the other what I need? (The motivation for dancing: just a topic for teachers in their daily life.) The day got heavier, guided by a dense schedule we were not really able to fulfill. On the evening before, there had been at least ten people interested in teaching at this conference; now there was nobody. So, instead of co-teaching (which was set on the schedule), we gave brief personal reports of our work, one by one in the circle. Many issues were presented, but at that time we were not ready to pick them up for further discussions. (For example: falling as a need for giving up the image of yourself; realness of Contact; the help of aikido, tai-chi, meditation and body-work; to look what is beyond the form; relationship between ground and space.) The afternoon was spent with COTE ACHING: three people share the time (two hours) with or without connetting their material. It does not mean to find something new, but to give the chance to look at how other teachers teach. This time, Bruno worked with sounds leading to Contact. Pierre treated the left side of our bodies including our vision and ended up (surprisingly) with cart-wheels. Moniek then went from personal movement into group-improvisation, followed by open dance. People were kind of uneasy or ungrounded. Later we tried to find out why. Someone observed that we were \"bad\" students. We felt that we were confused by Pierre's sudden change of direction and by the different teachings. Moniek got nervous when she realized that her intentions did not work out. A small \"accident\" happened, but nobody was hurt, and the open dance was exciting to watch. {There was no \"feedback\" scheduled but we found time for it in the very last discussion on Friday, and got to some interesting points   One was the issue of how to deal with accidents in class: to pay attention to the hurt person, according to the situation;. to pay attention to the partner as well, because he might feel guilty; a teacher can get feedback for their teaching by remembering the energy in the room when an accident happened.) We left for dinner on the first day without a clear plan for the evening activitysomehow confused and very tired. Many people thought it was because of the talking (which was actually listening), or, because of the dense structure, or what? Some peo· pie began to already participate only parttime. Other people found this attitude disturbing. This evening almost nobody came. The second day began with co-teaching. Karen and Alito led the warm-up: first taking turns watching your partner's breath (who is lying on the floor), then doing a warm-up dance together and talking about it afterwards. Danny Trenner then led us through exercises where we sang contrapuntal jazz rhythms in two groups while doing contact, to learn to work with an external rhythm while improvising, without being disturbed by it. After tea-break, we started our first dis· cussion: the essence of teaching; different cultures; contact in performance; problems of teaching. The suggestion of splitting into smaller groups was made but not accepted: there was either no need to split at that moment, or, more likely, there was the fear of missing something being discussed else· where. We got into a constructive discussion about TEACHERS' AND STUDENTS' ROLES. Unlike the martial arts, where the master-role is very clear, the teacher-role in Contact Improvisation can be confusing. But, as a teacher, instead of being overwhelmed by a student's fantasies and projections, you can receive their energy and give it back. Also, if you don't take a student's aggression or resistance too personally, you can break the psychological cycle. On the other hand, you do have to find a way to work with difficult students. You cannot avoid conflicts. The whole psychological situation in a class can be like Contact Improvisation itself: give and receive weight and transform energy. The after-lunch co-teaching was done by Stephen, Mark, and Kirstie. In the begin· ning, Stephen worked with being absolutely dead and then responding to your partner's leading. Mark talked about one's habits {Do they work with this partner?) and how decisions are made in the dance. Kirstie had us centered and did some Ki-testing. At the end, they experimented with teaching their material simultaneously to the whole group, leaving us in a chaos. This evening, after having dinner together at the school, we went into the NETWORKING DISCUSSION, an important part of the conference. The discussion was dominated by finding a place and an organizer for the next conference. Will there be a next one? How do we prepare it? It was a hot discussion, at least for those who participated verbally. For many of us, the English was too fast and the statements were not related enough to each other. Some were interested in just a jam and others were not interested in open dancing at all. But to find out what was most important in a teachers conference for the whole group was just impossible. Some quarreling gathered around the question of how structured a conference should be in terms of prepared topics, etc. Looking back, I think that we somehow felt that the \"teaching exchange\" focus of this year's confe\"rence didn't really work, the co-teaching was not convenient to everybody, there was not enough open dancing, and not enough time to meet people personally, all at the same time. And the conference will be over within the next day! But we could see clearly that a group-process is a group-process and cannot be compressed into one evening of talking about the schedule, but has to take place. By a vote we defined: all want another conference, three-quarters want more un· scheduled time. We agreed on two days of jam to get to know each other and to arrive, and three days of conference. We define ourselves as a support-group, but we can deal with a technical conference too. Also, the spirit of a conference is dependent on the organizer. Another conflict arose because of Euro· peans and Americans discussing European networking. One difficulty of this mix {in other aspects quite constructive) is the dif· ferent ways of communicating: the strong output of American participants vs. the European's preference for listening. Moreover, we Europeans have to stay in our cities to keep something going on, (and are not travelling around Europe giving workshops as much). We are still relying on each other; we have to. This is why the next day we made a gathering of European teachers (people who are settled in Europe and teach here) to talk about practical network. In that meeting, we agreed that it had been necessary for the first two conferences to invite somebody (i.e. Nancy) who is very well known and experienced. Her most valuable function has not been so much her attraction to get people to the conference, but her catalyzing presence. Yet, we will try to make it without special invitations next time and try to share the responsibility equally among everyone. On the practical level, we decided to meet next year not in a city but in a house in the countryside, which means meeting in the summertime. Three people volunteered to take responsibility, to ensure a gathering would happen. [See 'Notices' in this Newsletter for details about next conference.] The networking was understood as a real supportive one, not only in terms of teaching, but also as an exchange of performances and projects, ideas. This is the formal structure, the rest of it has to be developed in personal relationships. The European communication is still arranged through the NEWSLETTER, coordinated each time by a different person. We ended the conference with a final round robin and a party. We felt we have awakened potential connections all over Europe, seen that teaching problems get less dramatic when discussing them, and inspired each other through our dance~. See you next year.

    "Text": "The first time I danced contact it was in a dream: filtered light, heaviness in my lungs, another's weight and breath rolling against my back, blood pulsing in my ears. Seven years later, my dream came true. Cold and shivering in the murky water of a small lagoon I dive and turn, hearing my breath in my ears, diaphragm constricted, straining to see a long grey form swimming lazpy below me. I come to the surface for air, my breath exploding in a burst. I breathe in deep and dive below again. After a few minutes of swimming I feel my skin beginning to warm. I stretch my limbs in the water, letting the physical movement calm me. The energy moves down out of my head and into my heart. I feel my heartbeat regulate and my breath softening. My attention turns to the sounds around me, mostly clicking and trilling. What I sense is that sound in the water has a great deal of movement. The noises bounce and vibrate below the surface. Suddenly I feel a nudge against the back of my knees, and turning I look into the eyes of a large smooth skinned dolphin. He opens his long mouth in a wide grin and the sound that comes from the blow hole on the top of his head is surprisingly like a human laugh. In turn I laugh back, amazed, and find myself with a mouthful of salty water. I surface again for air and quickly dive below again. Moving slowly towards him under the water I keep my arms at my sides to appear less threatening, and brush against his smooth back with my chest and belly. The dolphin gently grabs my arm in his.mouth. It is an odd sensation, having this huge mammal hold me between bis 88 teeth (same as a piano, but that's a different story). Knowing this is a sign of friendship I try and hold still until he releases me. His mouth feels like the grasp of a small child's fingers. Feeling like it is my turn to make a move I reach for the dorsal fin in the middle of his back and hold on tight to catch my first dolphin ride. The dorsal fin feels very firm. It is like a smooth, rubber covered, triangular shaped tree branch. It isn't slippery at all; on the contrary, my hand feels like it is touching a wet piece of solid rubber. We are side by side, under the surface, as the dolphin pulls me through the water. We both come up for air, dive again and then I notice on my other side a slightly smaller dolphin. I reach over with my free hand and grab the dorsal fin, arms extended, racing through the water I feel like I'm flying. Feeling the water's friction pulling against my skin I imitate the undulating motion of the dolphins. This second dolphin is a female, and she is happy to join us. We twist, dive, nudge and explore the similarities and differences ·in the way we move. When I first danced contact I dreamed about it often. At first I thought it was because I was learning something new and it was occupying my thoughts in my waking hours. As I remembered more of my dreams I realized dreaming contact was a way for me to dance contact without the usual limitations of a wakeful dance. I could move and dance in complete 3-dimensional space. In my contact dreams I had no horizon to limit or guide me. I feel this freedom in the water with these two lovely, graceful creatures. I am aware of a dream-like quality to our water dancing. We spin and chase, touqb and push, arching and tumbling, ignoring for once gravity and its constant demand. I feel an exhilarating freedom in this original and most basic liquid. They are home in it. I am just a visitor, very aware of my smaller lungs and lack of endurance, yet they welcome me and honor my limitations. I fill my lungs again and dive, following their shadowy forms swimming ahead of me. They turn and wait, and as I catch up they separate slightly so that I am in the middle between them. We all come up for air, and they stay, bobbing in the water next to me. My husband and daughter ca11 a greeting to me from the shore and I start to swim towards them. The male dolphin quickly moves in front of me, blocking my way, while his female friend nudges me back into deeper water. I am mostly surprised, a little frightened to find myself in a dolphin sandwich without a lot of movement possibilities. How do I convey Time-Out? Breathing deep I center my weight and push outwards with my arms as I duck below the surface and head out into the direction they were pushing me. They surface next to me, one in front and the other behind me. I tread water and laugh outloud. I'm incredulous and pleased that they want to keep me in the water. I feel like a dolphin play-thing. I reach out with my arms, twisting myself slightly, and grab bold of their dorsal fins. We all take a breath and we're off again, a dolphin on either side of me. We make a large circle of the lagoon and then they start towards shore. We are diving and surfacing, diving and surfacing, sunlight shining on the water, the salty breeze, my daughter laughing and clapping her little bands. Diving and surfacing, two dolphins and a woman making brief contact, making a dream-like dance. -ti rubber-stamp by Gottlieb-Clark"

And it seems that little is added to this initial picture in the adult popular mind. I have read newspaper articles about \"the 5 senses and the mysterious 6th sense\" just this year. I am not right up to date on the current material analyzing the senses into all their component bits, but they were up to about 25 separate senses (each with identifiable independent nerves) in the late 1970s, which is a much more interesting number. If you are interested in other models, read J. J. Gibson's The Senses Considered As Perceptual Systems, read Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's work on Developmental Movement Systems (in past CQs), investigate the premises of yoga, acupuncture, or any of the Oriental physical systems which have been imported into the U.S., and read the provocative and heart-moving The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat, by Oliver Sacks. I think we can't have too many models of the senses and their operation when considering a topic like improvisation. It is a bit self-referential to say that the model I'm working on in this essay is about the effect of models upon the mind, but I can't see any way around it. I should mention in this regard that Buddhist thinking includes the mind as one of the senses. I am fond of that thought for the questions which arise for the analysts (how fast do we sense our thought?). If this is an amusing poser to throw at the sensoral analysts, it is because most of their work on the senses relates to those of the surface, disregarding questions about our sense of gravity, our feeling of the muscles of the body when they are quiet, or the sense of 'being', if I may propose such a sense. Yet the analysts' labor to discover the special nerves for each sensoral aspect is of interest, if only to explain the mechanism which allows us to dance to music, a most popular form of improvisation. If we can bop at a party because our perception of sound is faster by 4 milliseconds than our perception of our limbs' relative positions, we may surmise something about how the brain interrelates the senses. We could also look at time itself as a thing modified by each of the senses, instead of being an objective measure of duration. In other words, in trying to describe the sensing of time, we must refer to the perception of times. These times then must be collated into how long we think an event took, which is a very complex computation involving which of the senses experienced the event. F9r instance, if we drop an object from a known height, we have the math to calculate how fast it will be moving when it hits the floor. This formula indicates that, barring air resistance, any object increases its rate of falling constantly. With this mathematical tool, we feel satisfied that we comprehend the event. It is objectively clear. However, if we drop a soapy dish and before it smashes on the floor, manage to catch it, we can appreciate the sensoral complexity and precision of another point of view-the subjective feeling of gravity's effect on the dish, which enables us to save it. We treasure this facility in sports-eye-hand-body coordination of time, space and posture getting you there to snag the pop fly. I was deeply impressed by seeing a blind woman drop and catch a plate she was washing. For once, the eyes didn't have it. It 'makes sense', as the phrase goes, that our bodies are completely attuned to the gravitic effectthat the rate a body falls is abundantly obvious to our own bodies; that any discussion of subjective time should mention the gravitic factor in tuning the human time senses. And we might as well put in right here yet another factor, the state of our endocrine system, which can speed up or retard our experience of these times-just to indicate how extraordinary a job the brain is doing and to get some glimpse of how quickly it does it. \"Quickly,\" compared to what? Ah, \"quickly\" compared to how long it would take for the conscious mind to do the job. (This is my conscious mind writing, and I just wish you knew how long it's taking me to describe the little I can deduce about what my unconscious mind is doing.) a word Language, a medium in its own right, is deployed to analyze experiences. Language is either written or spoken. It is either for the eye or ear, but finally it is intended to be sensed by portions of the brain which decode sounds or symbols into meanings. We rely extensively upon it to communicate what we feel and think. We use it to qualify, quantify, and confirm and in general to hold our societies together. It is the major medium, I would estimate. Julian Jaynes has speculated (in The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind), that consciousness itself arose with the advent of the written word. The link of language to consciousness suggests many avenues for speculation. (It might explain the relative slowness of conscious thought, for instance.) I think it is well understood that there is much we experience which language cannot touch and should not be used for, but it is such an extraordinary medium that we keep applying it to all sorts of things, in hopes, perhaps, of contriving a successful new formulation; bringing the unconscious, un'knowable', or unspeakable into literate consciousness. I would bet that no dancer ever reviewed, however positively, has ever felt their dance captured in print. Yet language, used to describe other arts, forms a very important part of what we think about a work of art. It can certainly influence our point of view and may even suggest what can be thought about-that is, limit our perception or experience to the forum encompassed by language. It does seem to me that if we spend much time communicating with others via language about a painting, music, or a dance, we accustom our minds to the language version of the experience. There are sensible reasons for this. Human societies deeply appreciate evaluations which, like mining for gold, mean eliminating dirt and concentrating on what is considered valuable. Our actual experience of something can include much that is irrelevant to its evaluation. An apt evaluation of a work will likely be repeated by others to their friends. The further it goes from the source of the experience to a verbal or printed version, the less recourse we have to elaborations or answers to our questions. We put such a rendered experience into our own version of a context. It is an idea we flesh out with our own images. As such, it has become a fictionalized picture, it has become un-true, but we do it continually. Much of what we know about ourselves is described to us via language. The very idea of the 'imagination', for instance. How did you learn it existed? In many such respects, we 'imagine' ourselves according to categories, descriptions, and names of aspects of whatever we are told (or read) it means to be a hu;nan being. I have a soul, in other words, because the Bible tells me so. I have an ego and an id thanks largely to the writings of Freud, and an anima and animus courtesy of Jung. Not to belabor the point, we (think we) are conditioned to a considerable degree by our language. Not that the particular names, categories and descriptions we apply to ourselves have always been the same nor will they be used always. They reflect a consensus and will change or vanish as that consensus changes. Jaynes is fascinating as he tries to describe the state of the human mind prior to consciousness. But wc don't have to reach into the past to grasp some idea of how arbitrary our notions about ourselves are, we can examine ideas of cultures paralleling our own and feel the disconcerting void of (our own) recognizable terms of existence. Language is not only prominent, but it can be coercive. We may opt to disregard experiences which don't work in language. Tom Wolfe wrote a scathing article called \"The Painted Word,\" wherein he suggests that painters in the NY School of abstract expressionism were in fact led by the writings of a few prominent critics to paint as they did. He seemed to feel that this was a degenerate situation which devalued the art produced. It could be said however that this was an exceptional case of painters and writers developing the ideas of a movement in concert-exceptional in that it was a very intimate scene with a mix of artists, musicians, dancers and critics in close communication, and with regular forums for discussion. Language could then be developed to account for the paintings at the moment of their creation. What Wolfe and the rest of us are accustomed to is a 5-to-10 year lag, to give time for critical language to be invented to describe the work. When this has been accomplished it has the effect Wolfe was describing: people learn to imagine in and with the new concepts, and artists and student artists elsewhere paint in the described manner. One medium may support another, rather like the sensoral model: one sense may support another. However, I have begun to think that one medium cannot accurately describe another. We are used to the attempt to make films of novels, and then read critiques in which, to no one's surprise, the film is found a more or (usually) less successful 'adaptation'. Films are now 'novelized' to similar effect. Critiques do not adequately portray the art, either: it all seems to boil down tCJ \"you had to be there.\" There are nothing like the real things, whatever version of 'real' we happen to start with. Analysis of perceptions shows us the realms of 'reality' we are able to tap with the senses. Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, imagining arc, to me, each so very different from each other, seen subjectively, that I am apt to think of them as sensoral dimensions. Again, we adapt one dimension to another; 'loud' colors, for instance, is an 'auralization' or a sight. But the point here is to notice how the sensoral dimensions are different, since we are so used to confirmations of events through their blending. Watch a carpenter drive nails at close range-eyes see and ears hear the hammer. Then, move into the distance-eyes see first   then ears hear. What we originally felt as one experience has been divided between the two senses. We are mildly bemused by the organic 'analysis' we experience. for somethiNG In the 1960s there arose an artistic movement called \"mixed media\" in which one saw dances, films, language, etc., used in the same work. Now that I understand the senses and the mind as 'mixed media', I am very surprised that the movement got this name. It seems to me that what was really going on was 'unmixed media', since the words usually did not relate to the dance or film which did not relate to each other in familiar ways. The audience was challenged with an event occurring in several sensoral dimensions, and the effect was similar to that of the lag between the visual and aural hammer-at-a-distance. The mind's habit of synthesizing perceptions was confounded. This was for me an agreeable aesthetic experience, because it illuminated ordinary perceptions a bit. It served to train the mind to examine different modes of sensing, and created in the midst of life a new game to play. As I recall, during that time no one mentioned that the theater, opera and dance were already 'mixed'. No one noticed that film had been mixed. Perhaps that was because people were excited over the possibilities for further mixes. Sounds emanated from sculptures. Words emanated from dancers. New mixes occurred even within the same media: for instance, Bach and Rock together within a dance performance. Paintings became 3-dimensional, sculptures were made with new materials such as cloth or compressed cars. Painters made happenings which were a kind of theater loaded with colors and shapes and textures and people and costumes and props; in fact, they were paintings moving freely into the 3rd and 4th dimensions, using 'in reality' what before would have been the models for 2-dimensionaf works. It was a period of radical interface. We were confronted with unaccustomed juxtapositions, and of course came to see things that way. It was rather different than our former way of seeing and from this contrast came little sparks of information. That is how I evaluate it anyway; or value it. When we have two things to contrast, it seems to cause one to notice, and to learn. It was difficult to appreciate exactly what we learned in the complex midst of a happening; I suppose it all got synthesized in the mind, and one began to notice things that had escaped notice previously. It led me to consider the process of learning, and I came to regard the overall experience as a rather powerful conceptual tool with which one could cause change in experienced reality. The question arises, why did we not notice media mixed before? That is what is so interesting. John Cage had been doing it for decades, and Duchamp's work suggested it decades before that. The surrealists seemed to be concocting mixed media images, and Picabia and Picasso began to collage-to contrast painted images and real objects, to sculpt images from found materials. that can't Perhaps the answer lies in language. Most folk couldn't 'get it' because they were still quite busy trying to 'get' what had happened in impressionism and pointilism. Cubism caused folk further consternation. And who could includemelting clocks or a urinal or a prepared piano or a bus ticket in the same conceptual frame? The critical thought and conceptual tools of the day were already busily employed elsewhere, and the media did not dispense images or rationales as quickly as they do now. The arts, in those days, had begun to change far more rapidly than our language could accomodate. During this century it became clear that changes were occurring on every level more rapidly than before. But this experience needed time to be finally understood, and those early examples, such as the more radical examples of Duchamp, were put aside to accumulate a kind of critical mass. By 1960, with enough hindsight, the times'-changing had provided us with the model for the mix, and many artists were at once ignited. By then the popular media and critical establishment were ready, and the mixed medium event was considered seriously and widely announced, after more than half a century gestation period. Apparently an object doesn't have a life of its own, an objective meaning, but is imbued with values by the way we, with our changing minds, evaluate it. For many people, an object such as Duchamp's birdcage filled with small white cubes of marble was not illuminating, but only absurd. The mix can appear quite empty and gratuitous unless the mind has some context in which to work with it. So during the 1960s when so many artists began to mix images, terms were arrived at to convey the impressions. Then the Duchamp objects were re-evaluated and it was possible to see them, not as obscure Dada jokes, but as objects with a particular luminosity, which operate in some other dimensions of the mind than the linguistic one. They resolutely resist meaning anything; and as it turned out, this quality became highly prized in that period of intense critical and artistic interchange. The laughter changed from dismissal to delight, and th<i last laugh was probably Duchamp's. The special gift of the mixed media was to provide a contrast to our conventional use of media and the senses. We had to admit that we did use conventions to convey our thoughts and feelings, and to run our society at large. The new mixes indicated that, once in place, conventions can dictate what the mind will allow itself to think. It seems to be the nature of the mind, the senses, the body, and of the society made up of these, to fall into habits, which are necessary for continuity, aids to individual survival and collective civilization. Individual habits and collective conventions prod us to adapt what we perceive into the most convenient shareable mental construct. From the music we are accustomed to hearing, we form an idea of the intervals between notes. As our ears become more educated, we can become quite accurate in reproducing these intervals. Confronted with music in a different scale than usual, however, this aural education works against accurate reproduction. The unfamiliar intervals will be 'adapted' to the nearest known intervals. This adjustment is so automatic and unconscious that the person attempting to reproduce the new intervals will probably not even realize their mistake. Given another level of training in the logic of different musical scales, reproduction becomes possible, if difficult. For those who don't have such training, being confronted with an unfamiliar system can lead to confusion. Indian music, for instance, may remain opaque and possibly even disturbing; the intervals will seem wrong compared to the scale we are familiar with. In addition, it will be very difficult for the person to say why it seems wrong. The result may be a kind of unease and possible retreat from the unfamiliar system, a sensation of being lost. Not just lost, but without knowledge of how we are lost, for there are many dimensions in music where it is possible to go astray. Under these conditions, a little information about the nature of the systems is very useful for re-orientation. However a very different sort of aid is an appreciation of the feeling of being lost. Getting lost is possibly the first step toward finding new systems. Finding parts of new systems can be one of the rewards for getting lost. With a few new systems, we discover we are oriented again, and can begin to use the cross pollination of one system with another to construct ways to move on. Getting lost is proceeding into the unknown. To reject the familiar, so rooted in our nervous system and minds, requires discipline. The difficulty is that we have to know so much to understand what it is we do and why we do it, in order to know what to avoid. We are not attempting to simply eliminate the known systems, but also to realize how we have adapted to those systems. It is the habits of adaptation which will keep us reproducing the system. The system itself is not the problem, but rather this human capacity to imprint unconsciously a new system upon our old system-or to embody the maps of our acquaintance, however tenuous. We are close to improvisation here. When lost, we will have to relate appropriately to unknown and changing conditions. The dictionary explains that improvisation means 'extemporare', or 'out of the time'. I suggest that we interpret \"out of the time\" in two contradictory ways. I suggest we discard all notions of clocks, and the half-life of cesium, or celestial mechanics, none of which are capable of improvisation, and equate time with human experience of duration, which is to say the experiences accumulated in life, so that \"the time\" will mean who we have become. \"Out of the time\" will mean that, out of experience (conscious or not) there is material for making something. Simultaneously, \"out of\" should be construed as 'aside from'. We have to use what we have become in such a way as to not be so controlled by it that it is automatically reproduced. Improvisation is a word for something which can't keep a name; if it does stick around long enough to acquire a name, it has begun to move toward fixity. Improvisation tends in that direction. Dance is the art of taking place. Improvisational dance finds the places. °\"' -to be continually continued."

Both artists take consciousness as their content, and in order to anastomose across the many levels of its structure, they must work with a multi-faceted mind. Joyce was often originally misunderstood as writing stream of consciousness while in a subconscious state; and Lisa can be similarly misinterpreted by one who thinks she is simply doing the next thing that comes along. But closer examination reveals distinct, unbroken threads of sensory perception, reactions, personal and cultural memory, imagery ranging from archetypal and hallucinogenic to geographical and anatomical, and the dialogue of selfquestioning and self-discovery. Lisa has the added challenge of weaving these elements into a multi-dimensional tapestry-with rhythm, cadence and echo-on the spot.

    "Title": "THE POLITICS OF IMPROVISATION",
    "Authors": [
      "Carol Horwitz"
    ],
    "Abstract": "This article discusses the political aspects of improvisation, particularly in dance, emphasizing its immediacy, decision-making, and collaborative nature. It presents the results of a survey on the use of improvisation in college and university dance programs, highlighting its benefits for students and the qualities of an ideal improvisation teacher.",
    "Text": "THE POLITICS OF IMPROVISATION Of all the dance forms, improvisation is probably the most political-because it contains the urgency of immediacy. Improvisation forces people to make decisions on their feet and to live with those decisions. It helps people to see how their decisions affect others. When done by groups of people, it has everything to do with learning to work with others-not competing but working with the idea of the total picture and the individual's small but significant place in that overall picture. When working in duet form, as in contact improvisation, one is forced to really listen to what the other body is saying. In contact, movement choices are based upon forces of nature such as gravity and the spiral plus a direct response to the movement of the partner's body. This ability means survival in the contact form. While improvising, we learn again and again that to listen to another's movement is to come to a shared meeting ground. This is the politics of improvisation. With this in mind, I conducted an informal survey in the fall of 1984 to see how improvisation was being used in colleges and universities throughout the United States. Because of financial constraints, I wrote only to dance programs which offered at least a masters degree in dance. There were 60 in all; 31 responded. Here follows the information gathered: 25 of the 31 schools who responded had improvisation courses. 5 schools offered it only as part of another course such as composition. 15 schools offered one level, 7 offered it at 2 levels, and 3 schools offered three levels. 10 schools awarded 1 credit, 9 schools awarded 2 credits, 4 awarded 3 credits and 2 awarded 4 credits. 27 of the 31 schools believed it should be a required course, 16 believed one semester was enough, 4 felt that 2 semesters sufficed, 2 thought 3 should be required and one believed 4 semesters should be required. 15 schools allowed it to be 132 CQ/Cl Sourcebook Volume 12 1987 repeated for credit. Accompaniment for class ranged from voice to sounds, to canned music, piano and percussion, the range generally found in technique classes. The music was primarily provided by the instructor with occasional visits by musicians. One college always had live accompaniment, but this was the exception. It was felt that a wide variety of movement experiences should be offered in improvisation classes. These should include experiences with an aural, visual and art emphasis. Students should be exposed to the elements of dance in their most fundamental forms: space, rhythm/time, dynamics, body articulation, effort qualities, line, emotional qualities, gesture, sound, texture, sensory awareness on all levels. Other important aspects to include were phrase development, chance [methods], environmental inspiration, examination of personal idioms, group dynamics, elements of contact work, awareness of inner/outer space. Through these experiences, students should show an improvement in performance skills, a greater ability to think on their feet, greater trust in themselves and in each other, have an improved ability to recall, and generally be able to view the total picture within the framework of the dance, and dance within the framework of the arts. Most of the schools had members of their full-time faculty teach the improvisation classes. The appropriate teacher just seemed to surface. Some of the notable improvisation teachers mentioned were Daniel Nagrin, Claudia Melrose, Kathryn Karipides, Irini Nadel [Rockwell] , Barbara Dilley, Shirley Ririe, Joan Woodbury, Loa Mangelson and Ann Riordan, among others. On only one occasion did a Teaching Assistant teach improvisation. Qualifications for the \"ideal\" improvisation teacher would also qualify a person for sainthood, things to which all dance teachers aspire. He or she should be experienced, sensitive, have an ability to work from a problem-solving base, be able to create an Volume 1 2 1987 environment safe for exploration, be constructive, kind, open, have a sense of humor, empathy, extensive experience in improvisation performance, be able to handle emotional blocks, have an ability to work with imagery, be able to create a group dynamic, be able to structure problems that lead to meaningful solutions and, probably most importantly, be able to change plans mid-stream. The effects of improvisation experience upon students were noticed in their ability to experiment, explore and develop bits of material. They had a wider movement vocabulary, improved creativity, were more in touch with their own movement sources, took greater risks, created more authentic, less stylistic work, had improved technique and became more sophisticated self-aware students. They were more comfortable dancing with others. Students often experienced an evolution from fear to delight and it was a turning point in many of their lives. It was felt that improvisation had value in and of itself. Besides the obvious benefit of helping students learn to choreograph, it is an aid in learning to see and understand dance movement as it relates to all the arts. It allows the uniqueness of the individual to be celebrated. It teaches students to consider the value of their own movements before setting judgments. Improvisation enhances creative thinking and problem-solving, heightens kinesthetic perception, creates an awareness of group dynamics, fosters a personal viewpoint about dance, deepens awareness of movement logic and helps students to live creatively. No one mentioned the importance of improvisation in preparing students to teach children or members of the \"very special\" population. Also, the use of improvisation in dance therapy was not mentioned. I was surprised by this omission as I feel that improvisation is the very basis for working with these groups, which many dancers will do at some point in their career. Improvisation is seen as an art form separate from more \"conventional\" dance. At one school, students have to perform a structured improvisation before they can receive their dance degree. It was felt that there are some who are brilliant at improvising and they should perform. There were mixed feelings about the way it should be presented. Many saw it as having an important place within conventional choreography or within structured choreographic works. Some felt that it shouldn't be mixed with traditional choreography. Some felt that it stood more strongly in an intimate setting. The University of Utah was one place that received recognition as a place to learn about improvisation. Naropa Institute was another. Some of the other schools mentioned were Ohio State University, UCLA, Arizona State University, University of Texas at Austin, Wesleyan University, University of Arizona at Tempe, Sarah Lawrence, NYU School of the Arts, and Southern Methodist University. I think it is obvious from this survey that improvisation plays an important role in the training of dancers. I know there is a place in dance for the highly competitive classes that train the super-tech dancers who are so popular today, but I feel this survey supports the belief that there is still more to being a dancer, and that it can be uncovered through · self-exploration. An improvisation class can become the laboratory for exploration of the form and of the self. It can be a forum for sharing, not competing. It can be a place to celebrate our differences while helping us to understand that we share the same roots. \"Self-exploration,\" \"nurturing,\" \"sharing,\" \"celebrating,\" \"lifeenhancing\"-to me, these words represent a very strong, positive politics. It's this approach that keeps dance vital and strong.~ CQICI Sourcebook 133"

It does take some physical skill and listening ability to communicate timing, impulse and subtlety of moving weight and support in order to accomplish the aerial lift. I'd say it's more like the ink than the signature. [Nelson] \"Why are complete beginners so beautiful to watch, and experienced Contact Improvisors often so boring?\"· Beginners' Luck-we are watching an exploration of totally new territory, the unknown. With experienced contact improvisors we see expanding knowledge of an infinite unknown. Yet often a stage of doing contact involves a kind of automatic response, everything seems predictable for the viewer and doer, even if it still feels great to do, it can be personally stagnating. Learning new senses of disorientation and new choices of improvisation is challenging to the imagination. \"Why is there a hierarchy of Contact skills?\" Safety; some semblance of order is useful. To engage the senses, gross and subtle, is an overwhelming field of discovery. A teacher's personal \"hierarchy\" of skills is probably something very alose to their own dancing of contact. P.S. What are yours? \"Why are so many of my advanced Contact students unconsciously resistant to learning? \"Why can someone become advanced in a form based on communication?\" How do you as a teacher read a person's unconscious? Is this an advanced form of communication? \"Why do I expect to get 'danced on 1 at Contact jams?\" Personal history. \"Why are Contact-based performances so devoid of vision and self-examination?\" Because it is an unprecedented performance form and a study of performance values doesn't come along with basic learning of and therefore showing of the work. It's a style of its own, still evolving. \"Why does the allure of gymnastics skills overshadow the exploration of making contact?\" Could be because everyone loves and marvels at the ability of gymnasts-like when you watch the Olympics-and it's exciting to see these tricks performed live. Maybe it stimulates childhood memories. \"Why do experienced Contact dancers get frustrated with beginners?\" Because beginners are better at not knowing what could come next. \"Why does a form rooted in the senses give rise to a generic look, when life itself is so varied?\" Why do human beings look alike, distinguishable from kangaroos? \"Why did I overhear an audience member say during a C.I. performance, 'How can adults do all of that and not seem to feel anything?'\" How can we make this incredibly rich and varied inner world of sensation visible to outside eyes? * KAREN NELSON is co-director of Joint Forces Dance Company which produces the annual CI JAM at Breitenbush in Oregon where she lives.

    "Text": "The Berlin Jam has now been in existence for over a year, and is showing no signs of coming to an end. Many of the problems encoun tered a year ago have vanished, and the Jam is entering a new stage. As it grows, new problems come to the surface, and with time these also will be replaced. At least three of the four teachers offering contact courses regularly here support the Jam by informing their students of its existence. As a result, there is a regular attendance of 12-16 people, and usually one or two are there for the first time. In return, information is exchanged in the Jam regarding the classes and workshops which are available. Furthermore, The Berlin Contact Ballet has been formed by participants of the Jam, and has three performance dates in the upcoming months. On the other side, many of the people who have taken contact courses since before the Jam began have never been to the Jam. I hear that they do not have time since Saturday is the only day during the week to take a day off from dance. Those of us who enjoy dancing on Saturday respect this, and appreciate it. I have also heard that some of the more advanced dancers would come if more of the other advanced dancers were there. Contact Hierarchy? The Berlin Jam is predominately male, with a ratio of 2: 1. This is not surprising in a city where 75% of the contact teachers are male. Last February I had the opportunity to spend a weekend in Cologne, where a jam was also organized. It was a pleasant change to encounter a jam with 10 women and 4 men. I also participated in a workshop in Brussells, in which I was the only male for the first two days, and one of three by the last day. Last December I participated in the European Contact Jam in Angers, France, where the proportions were about equal, something like 18:17, and I am not sure which gender had the majority. Now, in Angers, there was one woman who was as fascinated by the gender question as myself. She asked questions such as \"How does it feel, you men, to be dancers?\" and made statements such as \"I really like seeing two men dance together   It is such a different energy than when two women, or a man and a woman are dancing together.\" Being one of the men dancing at the time this last statement was uttered, I was brought abruptly to the realization that men and women are different. Well, of course I won't presume to say how we are different. I do not often have difficulties in telling men and women apart, and if there is any lingering doubt, I can always contrive to dance with the one in question and take a gender energy reading. But precisely what this difference is, eludes me. Have you ever been told by another dancer that he/she prefers dancing with men? Have you ever told another dancer that you prefer men? Have you ever told your parents that you prefer men? I hear this preference often these days, much more often than a decided preference for dancing with women. And generally, the assertion of a preference for women partners in Contact Improvisation is often accompanied with the assertion of a specific woman. I do not want to imply that this is a problem. It is not a problem, unless you are not one of the \"preferred dancers.\" After all, there are men, too, that I do not want to dance with. Many dance forms have been dominated by men. In Kabuki, and Keith Ormand & Andi Lucas in the Berlin Jam. Peking Opera, women are traditionally excluded. Although not a dance form, Shakespeare's company had no women on the stage. Contact is much more lenient. Although even in ballet, men acquire recognition more easily than women, actually, ballet is not a good comparison, since, in Contact a very good female dancer may be regarded as outstanding, while a good male dancer may be regarded as standard. I believe it is rather the opposite in ballet. And of course, I do not want to use Contact Improvisation as a metaphor for society. That is up to you. Actually, I am interested in heirarchy. Who is good enough to dance with? Who should be allowed to participate in special jams and conferences? Who should be excluded? At one point someone at the Berlin Jam said that we should not tell anyone else about the jam, because there might not be enough room, and we might not like the newcomers. He conceded that anybody who had the energy to fit the jam into their schedule probably would not be so disagreeable, and probably could find enough room to dance in. In Angers, the question of who should be allowed to participate in the jam, and in turn, in the conference, was not easily solved. Well, I know that there is nothing I hate more than being forced to dance with bad dancers, or listen to th~ opinions of unqualified, nonfeachers. (Of course I know that space is often a problem here, but I prefer to deal with the problem of exclusion which occurs when there is enough space.) When is a dancer good enough to go to jams? Over here, many people start contact in classes. But how do they know that they are good enough to go to a jam? How do they know that they have reached the point that they can participate in workshops for experienced dancers? If they are not part of the dance crowd, they may never know. When they come to the jam and find that none of the dance crowd from the classes is there regularly, they have no standard to measure their own progress until they have established themselves either in the jam, or in the class. It is easy to think, as a newcomer, that the really good dancers do not come to the jam because they do not want to dance with the people there. It is easy to come to the conclusion that the dancers in the jam are not as good as the dancers not at the jam. This may be why it is so easy to dance in the jam; no challenge. Is it that the good dancers find the jam not challenging enough? or are they afraid of being hurt by dancing with someone who is unexperienced? I have heard these excuses. But how can the beginning dancer get enough experience to dance with a good dancer so that he/she won't hurt him/her? Are we going to support the beginning dancers? or is it a justifiable aim to keep contact among ourselves, now that there are so many of us. It would be safer, perhaps, to dance only with people we know. There may still be a little room here for taking risks. Or maybe you take risks by offering classes to beginners. Are your students good enough to go to a jam? Contact is in no danger of dying out, but is there any possibility for growth? In Berlin, the space problem is left alone, but we keep a careful eye on the quality problem. When a bad dancer shows up, we change the standard. In this way, we are sure that all the dancers participating in the Berlin Contact Jam are good.

    "Abstract": "Cynthia Novack explores the tension between egalitarian ideals and the emergence of hierarchies within the Contact Improvisation community. Drawing on Louis Dumont's theories, she argues that social roles and actions inevitably create hierarchies, even in movements that value equality. The article examines how distinctions between amateurs and professionals, skilled and less skilled dancers, and social dancers and performers challenged the initial egalitarian ethos of Contact Improvisation.",
    "Text": "The following piece is an excerpt from Cynthia Novack's doctoral dissertation, \"SHARING THE DANCE, an ethnography of contact improvisation,\" written in 1986, soon to be published. For more information contact Cynthia at 46 Warren Street, NYC, NY 10007. EGALITARIANISM AND HIERARCHY IN CONTACT IMPROVISATION by Cynthia Novack Anthropologist Louis Dumont has suggested that: \"The ideal of liberty and equality follows immediately f ram the conception of man as an individual. In effect, if the whole of humanity is deemed present in each man, then each man should be free and all men are equal . .. By contrast, as soon as a collective end is adopted by several men, their liberty is limited and their equality brought into question.\"' Dumont continues an analysis begun by Toqueville of conflicts in American society, arguing that \"to adopt a value is to introduce hierarchy, and a certain consensus of values, a certain hierarchy of ideas, things, and people, is indispensable to social life\" quite independently of \"natural inequalities or the distribution of power.\" Consequently, the ideal of equality, \"even if it is thought superior, is artificial.\"' Dumont is proposing that the concept of equality among individuals will inevitably be challenged by hierarchies arising from social roles and social action defined by the very concept of equality. His argument does not defend the use of power and control in hierarchy, but rather attempts to separate hierarchy from the automatic association with power and control which it has in Western culture. Contact improvisation embraced values of individualism, equality, and anti-hierarchical relationships, but, if Dumont is right, one would expect contradictions to appear between these values and the differences developing from social roles and social action, even if no one takes power. In the initial formation of contact improvisation, an egalitarian ethos maintained itself, with Steve Paxton as the teacher. As the contact improvisation movement developed, the looseness of organization within the movement contributed to an atmosphere of fluidity. As Steve Paxton notes, people were free to come and go; for those who chose to be involved in contact improvisation on only a casual basis, not much was at stake. So long as no one was concerned about the outcome of a performance other than to demonstrate the exciting new dance form of contact improvisation, and so long as the group of people participating in the dance form remained a small group of friends, everyone could be viewed on an equal basis. Contact improvisation could be practiced in both a social setting and a performance setting by the same people. However, for those people who became involved with the dance form on a professional basis, teaching and/or performing to earn their living, a great deal was often at stake. As the years went by, many of those who had been doing contact improvisation since the beginning became teachers, and some began to form performance groups. There was a spate of local group organization from 1977-79, as well as an increase in touring by individuals gnd by ad-hoc groups. Both teaching and performing established distinctions of roles within the movement. Differences between amateurs and professionals, between the less skilled and the very skilled, and between the social dancers and the performers developed. Lisa Nelson, after talking about the \"folk\" nature of early contact improvisation, commented, ''Eventually a lot of people became teachers and that started to change things   if you'd been performing, that kind of became a habit and you wanted to keep performing   after a while, it took you away from just being 'a folk' and spending time with 'the people.\"'  Inevitably, the ideqlogy of egalitarianism and spontaneity was challenged by the appearance of implicit hierarchy and overt planning. The demands of performing and operating within the professional dance worldpromoting one's work, applying for grants, seeking students-involved these dancers in somewhat different concerns from people who were participating in contact improvisation for social and recreational reasons. Dancers were often differentiated from each other on a more informal basis. Some emerging differences were simply based on the level of skill of individual participants: everyone began to know who the most able dancers were. Elizabeth Zimmer recalled her perceptions of the contact improvisation jams in Vancouver: \"There was a hierarchy. People tried to pretend there wasn't, but people who could really move got to dance with the people who could really move . .. like if I would ask Andrew Harwood to dance, we would dance for a while and then he'd say he wanted to stop and then he'd go on to dance with somebody who could really dance. So I'd consider it a good day if I got a couple of minutes with Peter [Ryan] and a couple of minutes with Andrew. So there were people you didn't want to dance with because they couldn't, other people you were reluctant to ask because they were so good, and depending on how you were feeling about yourself on any given day, you took certain kinds of risks.\" Those who were very skilled or very involved in developing the dance form often found their interests diverging from the increasing numbers of new and relatively unskilled contact improvisers, as well as from those long-time improvisers who were primarily interested in socializing. For example, in 1979, two large gatherings of contact improvisers took place. \"Current Exchange,\" a month-long meeting at the Western Front artists' cooperative in Vancouver, was organized by Steve Paxton for \"serious students\" of contact improvisation. Those wishing to attend had to submit letters to Paxton describing their activities and interests because Paxton did not want to teach or be in a position of responsibility for the group. The conference involved dancing, discussion, writing, and videomaking, a full-time endeavor for people with a strong involvement in the dance form. \"Country Jam,\" an event held that same year on Vancouver Island, was, according to Peter Ryan, ''exactly the opposite of Current Exchange.\" Ryan, who attended and helped organize both events, laughingly described Country Jam as \"dance for the proletariat   it was homespun, there was organic food and jamming every day.\" Ellen Elias, who attended Current Exchange, felt that it was \"elitist\" because of the requirement to write a letter, even though everyone who wrote was accepted. Among contact improvisers, she says, \"there was a way of being elitist that was subtle   there was definitely a sense of in-group, out-group, but it was supposed to not be there.\" Like Zimmer, Elias noted the social convention of assumed equality which overlay the existence of hierarchies. What is particularly notable about the contact improvisation community is not that hierarchies existed but that many participants were so conscious of them and disturbed by them. As mentioned earlier, many contact improvisers actively promoted the idea that an experienced dancer should be able to dance with anyone and learn something from it, as well as vice versa. At the 1980 Dance Guild Conference [\"Dance As Artsport,\" in Minneapolis], many of the remarks at a gathering to discuss \"Politics and Contact Improvisation\" were addressed to the problem of \"elitism\" and the \"exclusivist attitudes\" of the \"contact heavies.\"' People felt strongly that the egalitarian aspects of contact improvisation needed to be maintained. As the years passed, cultivating a spirit of trust and caring between partners remained a central component of contact improvisation classes and jams, and extended to the social ethos of communal organizations like Dance New England. On a social basis, it was strongly felt that the participation of everyone in contact improvisation was not to be sacrificed to the special abilities of a few people. But this ethos was very difficult to maintain as a part of presenting the work publicly. * 'Louis Dumont, Homo Hierarchicus (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966), p. 11. 'Ibid., p. 20.

    "Text": "''FALL AFTER NEWTON'' \"FALL AFTER NEWTON\" is a videotape that traces 11 years of development of Contact Improvisation from Steve Paxton's seminal work Magnesium in 1972 through consecutive years of Contact performances including Contact's 11th Anniversary Concert Series at St. Mark's Church in NYC in 1983. Steve proposed the documentary concept for \"F.A.N.\" after editing the videotape \"Chute\" with Steve Christiansen and Lisa Nelson in 1979 from performance tapes of the first Contact concerts in 1972. The great fortune of having video coverage of performances from the very beginning suggested the possibility of examining one dancer's development and looking for corresponding growth of the dance form itself. In 1980, the editing team plus Nancy Stark Smith, who was asked to be the focal dancer for the tape, began pouring through 9 years of video documents of performances (approx. 50 hours) and made a first 20 minute edit from the material. Seven years of sporadic editing sessions, script writing and revisions resulted in a 23 minute videotape in color and black and white with the following narration by Steve Paxton.

Charleston, VT 05833.] TRANSCRIPT by Steve Paxton When an apple fell on his head, Isaac Newton was inspired to describe his three laws of motion. These became the foundation of our ideas about physics. Being essentially objective, Newton ignored what it feels like to be the apple. When we get our mass in motion, we rise above the constant call of gravity toward the swinging, circling invitation of centrifugal force. Dancers ride and play these forces. Beyond Newton's third law, we discover that for every action several equal and opposite reactions are possible. Therein lies an opportunity for improvisation. We are looking at performance of Contact Improvisation, a duet movement form. This tape takes a sweeping look over 11 years of practice by Nancy Stark Smith, from her first exposure to the form I was working on when it was new in 1972, through moments chosen from consecutive years of performing with me, Steve Paxton, and with others. Nancy solos by testing her movement, playing with gravity and the floor, which are, in this work, not taken for granted, but are considered constant partners. She doesn't direct herself-she starts moving and then lets it happen, finding ways to cope with momentum and gravity. Here, in 1976, Nancy and her partner Curt Siddall move to follow the point of touch as it moves-a basic focus for their improvisation. In the play of moving and being moved, specific movements are unpredictable, but they occur within a knowable field-of gravity, centrifugal force, support and dependency. Human touch unites the forces which act upon the body, with the sensations they provoke within the body. This interaction makes it possible to keep all the parts of both their bodies harmonizing. They were not so adventurous 4 years earlier. In this first performance of Contact Improvisation, they were getting used to moving by touch. By feeling their way, they brought back clues about the form and about themselves and their perceptions. \"O 0 E' < ·al s 0 ..c Cl. c 0 ';< \"' 0  \"' > B \"' ~ E \"' -t ;:! \"' >u c \"' z ~ The performance which attracted Nancy to this form was a high energy study called Magnesium.

Now my loving is running toward my life shouting, What a bargain, let's buy it. by Martin Keogh Imagining the whirling dervishes, brings alive blossoming robes, hats resembling beehives, beards like bees in pursuit, and arms floating weightlessly, the lone clouds in a clear summer sky. The twirling faces focus on nothing as they turn, peering into the betwixt and between, into the limenal world. The original whirling dervish was Jalaluddin Rumi. Born on September 30, 1207 in Balkh in what is now Afghanistan, Rumi's family settled in Konya, Turkey after being exiled by the Mongol invasions. During the thirteenth century this was a meeting place at the western end of the silk road for Christian, Islamic, Hindu, and Buddhist worlds. Here he succeeded his father as head of a medrese, the dervish learning community. This fairly conventional career ended when he met the wandering dervish, Shams of Tabriz. Shams took Rumi's books, the sum of his intellectual brilliance and tossed them down a well to show him that he needed to live what he had been reading and writing. With Shams, Rumi met the \"inner friend,\" \"the beloved.\" However the mystery is named, he found it with Shams and out of their parting came Rumi's poetry. The poetry is described in the introduction of Open Secret by John Moyne and Coleman Barks: \"The essential power of Rumi's poetry is ecstasy, an ecstasy melting the confinement of the ego into a larger, elastic, cross pollinating dance of Selves. His is not the ecstasy of Union, not in the poetry. It is a love-ecstasy mixed with some brokenness and much longing. \"Rumi's odes and quatrains are the personal, human records of a man's being given a sharp, clear consciousness of the divine, and enduring it.\" Rumi died in 1273 and his funeral was attended by members of all religious groups including the different Islamic sects. Rumi was a Sufi, poet, dancer, and 144 CQ/CI Source\"book We don't need wine to get drunk, or instruments and singing to feel ecstatic. No poets, no leaders, no songs, yet we jump around totally wild. though it is immodest to claim, his acuity puts him in the geneology of Contact Improvisation. Though some of Rumi's poems were written, most were improvised and came out spontaneously metered and rhymed. It's difficult to find a comprehensive description of Contact Improvisation. There are adequate explanations of the physical and functional aspects of our dance, yet there is always that element which can't be embraced with language. Seven hundred years ago Rumi recited poetry that to this day speaks to the soul of Contact. Here is a sampling of Rumi's poetry. In the second group are poems that I feel have a connection to C.I. In the Sufi tradition, another name for the medrese is the night school, following the idea that we have a day mind and a night mind. The day mind does the laundry and pays the bills. The night mind is for poetry. These poems are ideally read aloud, at night. Think that you're gliding out from the face of a cliff like an eagle. Think you're walking like a tiger walks by himself in the forest. You're most handsome when you're after food. Spend less time with nightingales and peacocks. One is just a voice, the other just a color. The clear bead at the center changes everything. There are no edges to my loving now. I've heard it said there's a window that opens from one mind to another, but if there's no wall, there's no need for fitting the window, or the latch. D Contact Improvisation has always been sheltered under the aegis, the protection, of the founders' predilection for not creating certifications, degrees, professional associations and strict definitions of the form. From a broad variety of sources, imagery is created, related disciplines explored, points of view expressed, but absolutes are ultimately dismissed. How easy it would be to concretize into a set of exercises and rules this protean dance form which at its best is fluid. It is accepted but only whispered how Contact is a metaphor for our lives and that it has therapeutic value. Less talked about, and rightly so, are the spiritual elements, what we contact, or more likely what contacts us during those dances that are out of our constraint, where a third body is created. Contact Improvisation, like Rumi's poetry, is limenal, neither in balance nor over the edge. His poems express the dances that are not predetermined, those rare moments when the dancers disappear and there is only the dance. * Let the lover be disgraceful, crazy, absentminded. Someone sober will worry about events going badly. Let the lover be. Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase each other doesn't make any sense.

    "Text": "Alito Alessi, Alan Ptashek and Karen Nelson THE WORKSHOP DANCE WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS was a two day, JO hour workshop which brought together disabled and non-disabled people to learn and practice contact improvisation. The focus of the workshop was to explore contact as an accessible form for people of all physical abilities to meet on equal ground and experience the movement possibilities that exist between them. The workshop, which was attended by 60 people, was facilitated by Alita Alessi & Karen Nelson (Joint Forces), with special invited guests Kevin Finnan and Louise Richards of England, and Alan Ptashek and Bruce Curtis of the San Francisco Bay Area. Earlier in the year, Karen and Alita worked with Mobility International U.S.A. to develop an intercultural dance workshop with disabled and nondisabled people from Germany and Michael Goldhammer (left) said, \"It has to be fun to interest me.\" Oregon. Alan, an able-bodied mover, and Bruce, a quadriplegic mover, are both from Berkeley and have been practicing contact improvisation together for the past two years. Kevin and Louise, from England, have been working with different populations including dancers, students, old, young, able-bodied and physically alter-a bled, and have found contact improvisation to be an accessible and engaging form to teach. The workshops (which were free) were wheelchair accessible, and sign interpreted. [Alito] As no two people are identical in their expression of Contact Improvisation, styles and approaches toward teaching Contact are equally diverse. Collaborative teaching is a challenging situation where the exchange of facilitation, structure and spontaneity is formed by the communication between the teachers. The six facilitators of the \"Dance With Different Needs\" workshop had all been previously working in their separate home areas with people of varying physical disabilities. With the exception of Bruce Curtis's relatively new practice of Contact Improvisation, we collectively had many years of experience in teaching Contact to a wide range of students. As this workshop was our first teaching collaboration with one another, we had questions, but more so, an excited curiosity about each other's ideas and approaches toward shaping the teaching material. Day One We began the first of the two day workshop with an extended period of personal entry and exploration of the very large gymnasium. Spatial and peripheral alertness was gradually developed. We encouraged individuals to improvise their personal warmup. Attention to breath and the forces of gravity upon the body were emphasized. There were a few people with previous experience in Contact Improvisation, disabled people in both manuallyoperated and motorized wheelchairs, a 146 CQ/CT Sourcebook Naomi and David find ways of support in the chair. blind woman, a deaf woman, and others with lesser physical limitations or injuryrelated conditions. Many others in the workshop of approximately sixty people were able-bodied and interested in Contact as well as in learning within this particular situation. There was a high level of enthusiasm and willingness to develop playfulness and physical contact. The speed was faster than we had anticipated. We began to slow the overall pace and look toward a deepening of the process through which we move into contact with greater sensitivity and awareness. Those of us who could fall and enter the floor did so, while others stayed in their chairs, relaxing into the \"small dance\" that can be felt in a sitting position. The forms of contact between able and disabled movers slowly revealed the ways in which a person in a wheelchair often must teach and become the initiator when their partner is feeling awkward and tentative. It seemed to be equally important to allow that partner time to get in touch with their awkwardness. As we moved with one another in an increasingly more mindful and physically alert manner, our specific strengths became more apparent. When Michael Goldhammer explained to me that his head and neck muscles were the most powerfully developed extension of his body, we both found much pleasure in feeling the exchange of one another's strength and support. \"O :r 0 :::c \" c. ~ (cont'd) 11-year old Jessica and Karen Nelson rolled and rolled and rolled together.

Louise Richards guides us through \"log rolling\" across a sea of partners. all photos by Heidi Timm except where noted Later in the morning, we had people combine in small groups where each person was gently rocked and rolled along the floor. Particular focus was placed on the head-neck joint, inviting restful and fluid movement to be passed through the body. Counter-balancing with a partner was also explored in various positions, each person using whatever degree of movement and flexibility they had in their arms. A person in a wheelchair could lean their weight off the side of the chair so that they wouldn't be pulled too far forward or out from their chair by their partner's leverage. In the afternoon, Kevin and Louise introduced a different form of a gauntlet (two parallel lines of people facing each other) where one person slowly walked, wheelchaired, or crawled through the gauntlet from one end to the other while everyone in the lines gently blew upon their clothing and skin. Sensuality was a powerful and common feeling for us all. We held a round-robin toward the end of the day. There was little reluctance to enter the circle. We ended the day with a circle for feedback and discussion. Day Two Sunday included quite a few new people. We began the morning in a quiet and more reflective mode. Karen led an extended warm-up that brought us into light qualities of contact with one another, maintaining a feeling of warmup without further ambitions. Later, we covered one half of the space with mats and introduced \"log-rolling.\" Everyone lies on their stomach, lined up next to each other with heads pointing in the same direction, arms extended overhead. The contact between the sides of bodies is tight but flexible. One by one, a person places him/herself in a perpendicular direction across the bodies. Before beginning to log-roll, the joined bodies gently nudge and articulate some small movements upward to the person they're supporting to give them a feeling of buoyancy. Then, the person atop is carried along by the rolling bodies until he or she reaches the other end. For those people who left their wheelchairs, this exercise was an exhilarating way to experience the supportive combination of body, ground, breath and momentum, essential ingredients of Contact Improvisation. Staying on mats, we moved into partner work, what we call \"low table\" positions. Here, one person is on hands and knees, while the other partner 148 CQ/CI Saurcebook drapes him/herself horizontally over the back of their partner. Gradually, either partner can initiate some movement, changing shape and position in whatever way they are able. Relaxed but alert, the bodies can feel the force of gravity through muscles and bones. Higher support positions were also introduced, allowing skills for falling and rolling to be expanded upon. The level of trust, communication and safety was becoming very apparent as we entered another round-robin. The dancing was accompanied by some friends who played acoustic and synthesized music along with vocal improvisations. The workshop closed with a deep appreciation for what we all created. The desire for this work to continue was echoed throughout the group. [Alan] IMPRESSIONS Through the workshop, I learned about a deeper level of being supported, and opening my body to trust the support more, in more directions. This came after working with Jessica, a girl whose arms and legs have sensation but cannot bear weight without additional bracing or support. Her spinal and torso movement is fluid like a fish and we had a great time cruising the space by rolling. We discovered a way she could wriggle her weight onto me while working close to the floor. Once I felt the center of her weight directly on top of me, I could play with rocking her and shifting the position of my support under her, raising the level of the support to hands and knees. For her it was slightly delightfully terrifying-\"Don't! Don't! DO! DO! STOP! STOP! GO! GO!!\" So I stayed within her limits of how much permission to take. Her fear was of falling on her head without any protection from her arms while hanging forward across the bench my body made for her. Then we played with shifting her weight towards her feet, just enough so she could feel the floor through her flat feet, with most of her weight still into me. From here I crawled and she had the sensation of walking, feeling the floor pass under her feet while she took steps. There was something in her courage to trust my support and to follow her interests that affected my dancing. Later, during a round robin, I had a dance with an able-bodied man I'd never danced with before, David, where I gave my center in situations that are usually slightly delightfully terrifying for me-up high on a shoulder, hanging upside down, the support moving with momentum, no hands-and I felt deeply relaxed. I just realized in rewriting this story that I was in the same situation with David that Jessica had been in with me. We truly do instruct each other through the dancing. [Karen] \" In reflecting back on what I now prefer to call the \"Dance with Different Abilities\" workshop rather than \"Dance with Different Needs,\" I experience an immense gratitude for the opportunity to not know, to not assume mobility habitually and to appreciate more deeply contact in still frames. Leading a class with physical assumptions or habitual statements like \"Stand up,\" \"See the whole space,\" or giving any verbal instructions for that matter, could at times isolate. A good sense of humor was quickly cultivated. Verbal interpreting for the blind, sign interpreting for the deaf, and a multitude of modifications allowed for a moment by moment experience. Along with everybody else, I seemed to learn a lot about replacing the use of one sensory perceptor with another. Seeing with your skin could not become cliche. My perceptions began to expand through the transmission of experience in this atmosphere of diverse abilities. Considering the weight of a partner with a nearly total absence of muscular resistance gave me a profound experience of the \"small dance\" and enlightened me about the sense of an abandoned body moving through space where my willingness and ability to support was essential to the pleasure and safety of the dance. I also did a solo dance with a wheelchair, lifting it, rolling it over my back, balancing it on my shoulders. This allowed me to experience not only the spirit of the chair but how it was an extension of its owner's body. The anatomy of a wheelchair, with or without a partner in it, was a great education in mechanics, motion and caring. The idea that contact improvisation is an accessible movement form continues to expand in all directions regardless of one's physical abilities. A sense of common ground pervaded the space. [Alito]"

Where there is movement, no matter how small, there is the possibility of a dance. It sounds easy to say, and obvious, but it took a while for us to prove it to ourselves. We are Kevin Finnan and Louise Richards and we are members of New Midlands Dance, a British community dance company with a commitment to new dance. In early 1985 Lesley Hutchison became Artistic Director of the Midlands Dance Company which was until then a traditional contemporary rep touring company receiving an annual revenue grant from the Arts Council. Lesley transformed the company into a community dance resource for the region. In order to reach the widest possible range of people within the region, there would have to be a change in the company's way of working. New forms, New methods, New audiences, New dance! In the summer of 1985 we joined Lesley in forming the New Midlands Dance Company. We decided to focus on youth and special needs groups, sectors of the community with little or no access to the arts. Our work involves both performances and workshops in a residency format. We have just completed a year long project with special needs groups and are about to embark on a similar project with prison/custody populations, men, women and children. Whoever we work with: dancers, students, old, young, able-bodied or paralyzed, we have found contact improvisation to be an accessible and engaging form to teach. Our first real experience with a physically handicapped group was during a week long residency at a school for children with disabilities in Nottinghamshire. We had expected to be working initially with mentally handicapped groups but to our horror our first residency of a year of touring was to be in this school. Residencies are usually one week long and we work with a core group plus staff; teaching intensively Volume 13 1988 CQ/CI Sourcebook 149 and performing once or twice during the week. We had done a lot of preparatory work, particularly with mentally handicapped groups but none of this really prepared us for the first session with fifteen wheelchair-bound children. The group was nervous because they didn't know what to expect. We were nervous for exactly the same reason. We started very timidly, introductions and other warm-ups in a game format to break the ice, introducing the notion of touch early on. The group was resistant. They were handicapped so what could dance possibly be for them? On top of that they had all the usual teenage hang-ups about looking stupid, touching each other and associating dance with pop records or ballet. Most of them had upper body movement, few of them could move legs or feet. We worked a lot with contact through fingertips and heads. In pairs they started to use their weight through counterbalance and easy pushing and pulling. At first there was a real feeling of them doing it to humour us, but gradually over the week the pairs moved into duets. They worked on shared \"journey\" dances. For example, two people in one chair supported through each other's laps or backs, using their weight to initiate movement in each other. Strong bonds developed within the group, with each other and with us. The school is in a beautiful wooded environment so there were countless invitations to accompany them on walks on the special wheelchair trails. It was hard not to form real attachments with two girls in the group who took me (Louise) for regular lunchtime strolls. Going up steep hills they (in their chairs) left me (on my legs) standing. I (Kevin) was invited to play soccer in the playground with pupils and staff. I was amazed at the speed and vigour of the game, wheelchairs and crutches flying past me. Receiving a great pass from a young lad in a wheelchair on the wing and filled with sudden enthusiasm I turned and volleyed the ball goalwards, only to see it ping off the head of a passing lad on crutchessending him flying. I was mortified, what had I done? I could see the headlines: \"Dancer assaults crippled child.\" I began apologizing to everybody. To my surprise this promoted gales of laughter at my expense. I was learning another seminal lesson: Just because people are less able in some way it does not mean that they need to be wrapped in cotton wool and touched at arms length. The children were physically adventurous and were 150 CQ/CI Sourcebook prepared for physical risk. Over the week, through the dance sessions we became more confident and they became more adventurous, taking full weight, spinning their wheelchairs and supporting themselves through new body surfaces. We were successful in challenging their notions about what dance was and showed them they could create their own. During the project we have worked with a range of disabilities. With the chronically disabled we start from relaxation, rocking, listening to and working with the breath rather than imposing movement, allowing ourselves to be with another body, picking up breathing rhythms and amplifying them into shared movement. We don't do to people. Even the most handicapped person can move someone else-we lay our heads in the bowls of their abdomens and let their breath move us. A shared responsibility. We had a dance with a boy called David who has head movement but no other body movement. He was propped on a cushion, we put our heads together. We explained to him about listening to the moving point. Slowly it began to roll around our heads. Sometimes it would slide, we'd explain to him that we needed it to roll so that we were moving and being moved by each other. This developed into a twenty minute dance of amazing intensity. David had a huge grin which never left his face. We don't just work with children. Similar work at an adult residential centre developed much further due to our increased experience and confidence at that time. We began with everybody out of their chairs. Finger dances which rolled down arms and into torsos happened early in the residency. We taught about weight and momentum and they learned that their seemingly immobile weight could affect change in someone else. A man called Ian resented being moved and responded with \"I'm not helpless, you know.\" We told him he should move us too and he could do this by letting his weight fall back, thus pulling us up. We really gave our weight in these counterbalances. By further using counterbalance and shared balances back to back or side to side, people could support themselves on unfamiliar levels. By using the natural ledges on our bodies, backs, hips and thighs, we would feed their weight through our bodies in the passage from up to down. We used a lot of \"body surfing\" and \"log rolling\" and developed ways of using table work both as supporter and supported. For example, people with upper body movement were able to use their arms as levers to get on and balance on our backs, and were often able to sit on their folded legs and use their arms as main supports to take our weight through their backs. With careful regard to the weight, this developed into a dance, transferring support between us, swapping roles and using flow and momentum to move. Early rocking developed into tumbling, throws and catches where people could experience spatial disorientation. It is impossible to explain people's joy in this work. For more nervous people we made physical structures to give movement experiences. For example, interlocked human \"tables\" became a mobile support structure. One woman lay on the backs looking at the ceiling and said \"I've never been upside-down before.\" It is not always possible for people to communicate verbally as to whether or not we are achieving anything, particularly when mentally handicapped. However we believe the dance communicates on a very deep level. In one session a man got quite violent. He was working with one of our helpers and started to lash out with his fists. Intuitively I (Louise) grabbed his wrists but rather than blocking and restraining him I began to move with him. Gradually his energy changed from confrontation to flow. Sandra was a group member who gave no sign of recognition from one session to another. She didn't seem to understand any of the work we were doing. One of our warm-up exercises involves passing a touch point from finger to finger around the circle. On the very last day I (Kevin) made a point of saying goodbye to her. As we were leaving she came up, did a wonderful \"finger dance\" and touched her finger to the end of mine. I was speechless, shocked and deeply moved. There are many of these stories and we've chosen these few to try to convey at least a feeling of the work. What seems to be a daunting task is incredibly rewarding. We are not therapists but dancers who teach dance to people whatever their abilities because we believe that dance is for all. We haven't space here to discuss our performance work in this context, although it too is an integral part of the work. Maybe that will be another article. Certainly we plan to write another installment on our experiences teaching contact in custodial settings. tr"

    "Text": "It is my first contact class after a seven year break and the first dance at all after months of painful resistance against any engagement in the moving arts. A friend has convinced me to participate in this Contact Improvisation workshop taught by Nancy Stark Smith in Spain, north of Barcelona. Very slowly I settle back into the body, keeping my vital forces way down inside. The air around me stays empty and my heart aches in consequence of neglecting its basic needs. The teacher tells us to kneel down and connect with the crowns of our heads. A tall young dancer with sea-blue eyes slips towards me and offers his head. Our bodies hardly move while we sit quietly tuning to each other. Through my skull I feel the pulsation of his spinal liquid, the rhythm of his blood, feel my hesitant expansion towards him and decide carefully to open up a little bit more. \"Let's roll across the floor, keeping in contact with the top of our heads.\" Gliding across the wooden surface we look for a synchronized movement. His nose reaches already up into the air, mine still sticks to the ground. \"Now roll back to the other side of the hall. Allow yourself to go slow; when you feel stabilized in your connection you may want to develop a more open dance with each other, from time to time coming back to the head connection.\" We exchange no opinions about our way of working together. His attitude is serious and alert. We both focus on our task, intending to align our abilities. Like siamese twins we are rolling now, grown together at the crowns of our heads. My brother starts to guide me through the space, passing arms, feet, legs and torsos of other dancers. He calls me internally and waits for my answers. His touch is delicate and firm at the same time. I try to catch an expression of emotion in his face. His gaze is relaxed and empty, while he is diving deeper and deeper into the realms of my intuitive self. Reaching a rare level of trust I allow him to hold me, carry me and let go of me. For a tiny second I am as happy as a toddler. But as my mind is realizing the long lost feeling, it vanishes under the weight of memory. My partner keeps moving. Inhaling the fresh smell of his sweat I curl into his lap and want to stay there, losing my sense of self, ready to slip back into the liquid warmth and timeless security of a womb. He keeps moving. He is obviously an experienced dancer, unlimited in his gentle presence, clear in his direction, while my perception is flooded by images, feelings, rhythms and vibrations. Like a little boat I am rocking across his body waves, feeling his bones and soft Volume 13 1988 stILL G NfOVI CQICI Sourcebook 153 tissues communicating with mine. By now my lungs empty completely. Each exhalation goes further and is sometimes accompanied by an unconscious sound of agreement. Our breathing patterns overlap, we lose culture and age, but I stay always aware of being a woman. For the glimpse of a moment a silvery net is woven around us by dashes of sunlight, spread all over our bodies. The next minute we are blades of grass in the summer wind, intermingling with the group energy. The two of us are not alone in this space-we touch others flying through their territory, grateful: ly catching the arm that supports us the moment we lose our balance. A little laughter jumps out of my throat. Hey, babe, life can be fun! No reaction on his side. He always keeps moving. Finally we discover our spiral spheres and now I am expanding completely. Yes! Fun! Love! Spirals up and down and up again in different speeds and colours. Spirals towards a subtle completion. Our bodies agree to finish the dance. Gently we unwind the energy threads which carried the codes of body language. A few more touches and swirls and thanks to the floor. Then: Gravity and empty space. As soon as the dance is over, the communication system is fallen apart. Here I am with onehundredtwentyseven questions I never dare to ask: Is a dance like this daily life for him? Was the level of contact my own projection? Did he enjoy the fluidity of our movements as well? Which images arose for him? What did he learn? The class continues, other dancers come, but this first dance stays with me. My questions unfold into an investigation of relationship-patterns. Something has been healed inside of me, has been replaced by soft openness, curiosity and a need for creative expression. In the dew of the next morning I sit down to continue the dance with my type>,yriter. Across the printed letters my eyes are wandering towards the milky bluish mountains in the distance. Birds busy with being surround me and the heavy sneeze of a Spanish farmer echoes through the valley and is answered by angry barking dogs. *"

    "Abstract": "Tom Trenda describes \"Deepening,\" a structured movement form combining elements of the Trager Approach, Authentic Movement, Re-Evaluation (CO-)Counseling, and Contact Improvisation.

Trenda explains the preparation, basic structure, and application of Deepening in a Contact Improvisation context, highlighting its benefits in fostering personal validation, movement exploration, and a new relationship to form.",
    "Text": "Deepening combines elements of work that I've been doing in The Tragertm Approach, Authentic Movement, Re-Evaluation (CO-)Counseling, and Contact Improvisation. This work was first presented in a class that I taught with Danny Mack and Susan Brokaw at the 1987 Breitenbush Jam. I listened to literally hours of personal testimony and feedback by highly experienced contactors after this class, which indicated to me that I was \"on to something.\" This work is not about the advancing of Contact Improvisation skills exclusively, although from the feedback I've received, it seems to be very effective in that way. It can be applied in various movement contexts, from dance improvisation to dance therapy. It is a very specific structured form which demands a high amount of commitment, attention, and focus. What is Deepening? Listening to another while they move is at the heart of this experience. Like Authentic Movement, this form is about one person putting their undivided attention on another, without judgement, comment, or intentionally shaping their process. Simply being there with that person with total commitment to whatever they do, as \"witness\" to their process. Unlike Authentic Movement however, the \"witness\" uses not only their eyes to \"pay attention to,\" but also their hands and (later) their bodies. Why touch? Because touch gives a kind of information that cannot be obtained through just observing. I am not only looking for the information that I can get simply from how I see your movement. This experience is deeply physical. This kind of connection, this kind of \"being with,\" is not only through a visual mode, but includes the kinesthetic/tactile as well. It is the experience of seeing, touching, sensing, and moving with, on all levels of someone's body, from periphery to core. Feeling experiences which often arise out of this kind of deep, intimate sharing are those of profound personal validation and support. Preparation I first have people pair up and I teach basic Trager hands-on skills. With one person laying on their back, the other places their hands somewhere on their partner's body and \"settles in.\" The focus is on deepening the level of contact with one's hands through the surface structures of their partner's body such as skin and body shape to the deeper structures such as skeleton and organ. Once this kind of contact is sensed, the active partner begins to lightly rock the body of their partner, sensing for the movement of the skeleton and the pathways this movement is traveling on. This works beautifully to drop people into their body's core, and to engage them in focusing deeply into another person's physical structure. Through the work of Milton Trager, I have learned that by developing sensitivity in the hands along with the focusing capacities of the mind, the surface of the body can be penetrated allowing core structures to be contacted and moved. This kind of \"penetration\" or depth of touch is necessary in the Deepening experience. The intent, once this is obtained, however, is not to \"do\" anyt~ing with those deeper structures, but simply to contact them, to listen and to follow what is happening in there while that person is moving. The basic Deepening structure The basic structure begins with one person in the pair moving on their own and the other person observing. Throughout this whole experience the person moving is focused on referencing everything to their own center, edge, flow, timing, weight, momentum, intention, etc. In other words, they are soloing. The person watching is following with their eyes, the whole or any part of this person's body moving-wherever their attention is drawn. Next, the person observing moves into the other's kinesphere and begins to follow the movement of any part, [touching it] with their hands. Here it is helpful for the person moving to work at a slow pace. This facilitates contact from hand to body. It is also important to note here that the person \"soloing\" is not initiating or \"leading\" the other, but simply moving while someone moves with them. They are paying attention to their own movement process. Their partner is also paying attention to the movement process of the person soloing, with their eyes and hands and whole being. This is an experience of \"one-way attention.\" In other words, both partners are paying attention to one person's dance. It sometimes requires an active intention on the part of Volume 13 1988 the person following to not initiate, limit, or direct their partner's movement, especially if they have had a lot of Contact Improvisation experience. Noticing the subtle ways in which we do this in Contact Improvisation is one of the benefits of practicing the Deepening form. This means that when a movement is going outside of one's reach space, the follower must simply let it go. To pull the motion back towards oneself by changing the pressure would inhibit the full movement of one's partner. It is helpful for the kind of deep contact I spoke of earlier that the person Applying Deepening in a Contact lmprov context If I am working with a group of Contact Improvisors, I will have people focus on bringing the experience from the edge (hands) to the center (torso), and throughout the whole body. The person \"paying attention to\" their partner (while that person continues to \"solo\") begins to use the rest of their body to follow, track, and read their partner's movement in just the way that they were using their hands earlier. Here I make it clear that it is not about \"going after contact,\" but is about allow0 0 _c 0. Tom Trenda & Bev Rackoff following does not ,jump around with their hands, but rather rests on one body part, \"reading\" as much information as is possible about the whole organism from that one moving part. There is everything to be learned about a whole from any of its parts. Of course, it is a lie to say that the person moving is \"soloing.\" As soon as one is aware of being watched there is interaction. And when one is being listened to through touch, there is certainly a presence there to be reckoned with. But just as one can do a \"solo\" dance piece with many people watching, one can also solo while being touched if the person touching has a presence of respectful attention. ing any body part that is convenient to come into this role, as the movement flows through one's kinesphere. This prevents people from throwing their centers into contact. It is O.K. to be in the way of your partner's motion-you are a part of the environment in your partner's dance. Issues of weight support invariably come up at this point. Torsos weigh more than hands. If I am following a Volume 13 1988 movement with my hand I can be above or below it, without much change in weight. But if I follow someone's movement with my torso to a place where I am on top of them, they are supporting my weight, but I am supporting their movement. Similarly, if their movement takes them to a place on top of me, I focus on supporting the movement, not the weight. The focus is not on giving and taking body weight. This is often what makes Contact Improvisation so static: you give me your weight, I'll give you my weight, and [thus] the dance of all the signals and responses associated with this. Weight sharing is one byproduct, just something that happens to happen, in the process of reading someone's movement with certain parts of your body in the Deepening form. At this point, I might suggest the soloist begin playing with moving faster, changing levels, and jumping. Or the partners can allow the roles to dissolve, keep moving, and take from this structure anything they feel [like] integrating. I also structure sessions for specifically working on connecting in this Deepening way in running, falling, and jumping. This seems to be very challenging-to come into contact with a quickly moving body without shaping the course of that jump, run, or fall. The outcome Some of the benefits of doing Deepening are rooted in the fact that it is about taking turns. How often do we get to receive such undivided attention to such a major part of ourselves? To be supported in whatever we are doing? Receiving this kind of attention from someone enables one to go deeper into their own body/movement process. This form creates a high degree of safety for people to explore their own movement. As the person moving, you get very committed to your own movement without a lot of ego investment. This comes from someone else's commitment to your movement without ego. As the person following, focusing one someone else enables you to let go of any of your own stuff about your own movement. It takes the focus off yourself and how well you are dancing. Through practicing this work a new relationship to \"form\" can be discovered. It could be said that \"form follows following.\" Awareness of form grows organically from the inside. Pathways begin to emerge through the skin and extend out of (and back into) the body. It comes unself-consciously from the mutual commitment to following each other's internal movement pathways. *"

    "Abstract": "Alan Ptashek discusses his collaboration with Bruce Curtis, a physically disabled man interested in Contact Improvisation. He reflects on the pre-conditioned responses able-bodied people have towards disabled individuals and how their practice challenged and expanded ideas about movement limits for those with spinal cord injuries.",
    "Text": "by Alan Ptashek In the SUllllller of 1986, Bruce Curtis called me and introduced himself as a physically disabled man who had become very interested in Contact Improvisation. He described his previous experiences with this movement form as well as his travels within and outside of the United States. Without having met him, I was already seeing Bruce in terms of the mobility and curiosity that had led him to explore Contact Improvisation, a dance form that I have been practicing, developing and teaching since 1974. I was also thinking of how I might interact with a person who has spent more than half of his life in a wheelchair. I knew that within myself and most able-bodied people, there exists a wide array of pre-conditioned responses and behavior that has limited and confused our interactions with disabled people. At the extremes of one's discomfort/ awkwardness with disabled people (and vice-versa), we may unconsciously be physically distancing ourselves, avoiding direct or sustained eye contact, or behaving in an overly protective manner. As I viewed tapes of Bruce's earlier dances, I felt excited by the possibilities for developing a physical vocabulary between us, one that could challenge and expand previously held ideas about the limits of movement for those with spinal cord injuries. Bruce and I acknowledged that there was much more ground to explore, and we began a regular practice of Contact Improvisation, a collaboration that held equal amounts of enthusiasm, caution and wonderment for both of us. Learning where and how one's Contact partner senses and carries their center of gravity is essential to the development of trust and physical rapport. Bruce's wheelchair was an immediate part of that learning for me. The man and his wheelchair are definitely not inseparable, and a constant awareness needs to be maintained for intuitive-ly and· reflexively determining the boundaries and shifts of balance between Bruce's body and the structure of his chair. In another sense, I often feel Bruce's chair as an extension of his total physicality, sensing the combined weight of body and chair as one moving mass. By placing my arm, hand or larger surface area of my body, such as my back or hips, in contact with any surface of Bruce's body, I gain immediate access to sensation, motion, breath and balance in Bruce's body as he moves in his chair. If my hand places a gradually increased amount of weight around the side of, or at the back of Bruce's head, I can use his responding movement and weight exchange as it enters my hand (which is spread and channeled throughout my entire body). I feel and image his entire spine moving downward through the chair's seat cushion, feeling his spine rooting into the floor. There is a corresponding upward movement through his spine and head into my hand, as contact and awareness of these multi-directional forces of gravity and momentum are established. As both of us maintain this bodily-felt relationship to weight exchange and shared movement and stay open to sudden impulses and influences upon either of our bodies, a playful, energetic and innovative dance is created. An essential quality of improvisation is an appreciation for what is taking place within the present moment of one's awareness. Following our instincts and trusting our inherent bodily wisdom will guide us toward our next perception, feeling and action. As our practice has continued during the past year, Bruce and I have become much less protective of one another, more open about our confusion, discomfort or expectations. We move together, with Bruce in and out of his chair, both on the ground and at higher levels from the floor, where Bruce can be supported around my hips or shoulders. Sudden lifts of Bruce's body from either his chair or the ground create momentum for spins and swift descents back to the ground. We've practiced basic skills for relaxing the body as we spill into the floor from higher support positions. As with many Contact Improvisation duets, the high velocity of movement and risk between Bruce and myself rriay suddenly be experienced as a heightened state of alertness and precision, our awareness of time and space relaxed and expanded, moving safely through our movement possibilities. Bruce's wheelchair is surprisingly light and responsive to subtle degrees of weight and momentum, although it is Bruce's receptivity to those subtleties that determines how my body and movement can shape itself with his chair. I have leaned and thrown my weight on Bruce and his chair from many angles and impulses. We have occ\"asionally fallen onto one another's body and the floor, with the chair somehow cooperating for our safety and continued contact with each other. Neither of us have ever been injured in our dancing. Our warm-ups include taking weight across one another's back and hips, counter-balancing through the extension and grip of each other's arms and hands, slowly stretching and releasing tension from muscle and joints. We focus deeply on internal awareness of breathing and finely-tuned balance. Where certain areas of Bruce's spinal and muscular functioning is limited, I have developed an intuitive capacity to locate those parts of his limbs and torso where he can initiate movement, and direct the needed amount of pressure to sustain our surface of contact without slipping or losing our communication. Whether this limited physical functioning is within his fingers or around his pelvis, there is always enough time and attention for us to kinesthetically scan through our bodies for other areas of strength, support and balance. It is this \"scanning\" that creates the movement vocabulary which is shared between Bruce and myself. Our work together has been observed and commented on by movement and somatic educators, dance and physical therapists, performing artists and other people with physical disabilities, both less and more severe than Bruce's. We have performed before a variety of audiences within the San Francisco Bay Area, most recently through The John F. Kennedy Center's Special Arts International Program, at Grace Cathedral Church and at The New Performance Gallery. University and cable TV stations have produced and aired tapes of our work. Exposed to Gravity: Two Men Dancing, a video edit of our work, has been screened at various educational video festivals in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Nicaragua and China. Our practice sessions and video tapes have been viewed by individuals and groups who are interested in movement and body awareness for those with spinal cord injuries. Bruce and I do not look upon our dancing as a particular form of rehabilitative or therapeutic work, although those aspects and benefits are acknowledged and may be applicable in working with other disabled people and those who are inter"

    "Text": "an active and attentive relationship to all areas of Bruce's body throughout the time of our dancing. There are no \"dead\" or unfeeling parts of Bruce in my relationship to him as a moving human body who is as fully involved in the life of our dance as I am. Comparisons between our abilities are limiting and too predictable if based solely on physical skill and functioning. Our minds, hearts and creativity join us in deep and powerful ways, that integrate and often transcend the obvious physical differences in our bodies. In a Contact Improvisation dance, there are somatic activities taking place on many levels of consciousness and perception. The glandular and neuromuscular systems are being filled with sensation, becoming a direct source for the communication between still or moving partners. What is happening while we are rolling, falling and 162 CQ/CI Sourcebook guiding ourselves and partner via the feedback exchanged through skin, nervous system and internal organs? As our body spins and suddenly shifts from standing or sitting in a chair to balancing on arms or head, what accompanying changes are ignited through the body as cerebra-spinal fluid or adrenal gland activity pulses through the moving partners? To what extent does emotional excitement play upon the ability to feel movement and expand ourselves motionally? In my movement with Bruce, these questions and interests arise and provide direction for our future explorations. I'm reminded of a particular image described by Bruce after one of our practice sessions. He referred to parts of his pelvis and legs as having \"black holes,\" whereby reaching through his senses he goes \"fishing with the flashlight of my awareness\" into those black holes, in a sense, providing the pathway for sensations to be felt. Movement can't be forced in any \"O ::;,0 0 @ body. Desire and risk are called upon if there is to be a deepened and more fully conscious movement for any human being. As we continue our collaboration, Bruce and I are interested in moving with other disabled and able-bodied people, and in offering lecture-demonstrations and workshops. We want to work with other individuals, groups and organizations who support the development of movement arts/ education as a valuable and inspiring basis for play and communication for people of all levels of ability and disability. In these ways, Bruce and I hope to further explore and share with others a dance and dialogue that we have delighted in. 0"

    "Abstract": "Cheryl Pallant reflects on a Contact Improvisation performance in an alley in Richmond, Virginia. The article explores how the unique environment, filled with urban artifacts and outdoor elements, influenced the dancers' movements and the overall experience, contrasting it with the sterile environment of a museum.",
    "Text": "Yes, a group of us have been contacting regularly here in metropolitan RICHMOND, [VIRGINIA] and s!owly rousing the curiosity of others. \"ls it a sport?\" \"Oh, it's choreographed.\" Anyway, recently DENNY SORENSON, ED CLAP, KEN MANHEIMER, SUZANNE NAY and I performed publicly and in my attempt to understand, at least translate my experience into words, I've written some reflections from the day: Contact in an Alley I had noticed the fluorescent flyers stapled to the walls of Fulton School. How could I miss them amid the otherwise drab chipped paint on the walls? I picked up an orange one from a table in one of the halls, studied the collage which incorporated the Richmond skyline atop a pile of rubbish, then read its only words, \"Ram Cat Gallery,\" and wondered why I had never heard about this gallery before. Was this to be a new display space for art? Several weeks later, Suzanne Nay, one of the members of the group I'd been doing Contact lmprov with, asked me whether I'd be interested in participating in Ram Cat Gallery. To her I addressed a barrage of questions. Downtown Richmond is laced with a network of alleys. Usually you only know the one behind your apartment and the one behind your workplace. Although I'm familiar with many more (they're great for evening walks), I had never encountered the alley called Ram Cat. It's a typical cobblestone alley, out of the way, unknown but to a few, and like every alley, used regularly by sanitation engineers. This section of town like all of historic Richmond had its peculiar sites and stories. At one end of the alley stands a three story milk bottle, in 1913 the home of a dairy, and at the other end, the studio of Blab TV, a local cable show featuring philosophers er   um   publicly blabbing. Several artists, Suzanne one of them, had chosen Ram Cat as a site for visual artists, musicians and performing artists to showcase their wares. Did I want to partake in this event by doing Contact outdoors? I said yes and several days later, a few days before the show, investigated the space which I quickly found to be full of glass, parts of pipes, strips of wood and a hodgepodge of other items that would make dancing much more than a challenge. After envisioning myself rolling across the ground, rising with my face and limbs bloodied by what I had encountered en route, I considered renegging on my previous agreement. Art for art sake is fine but blood is blood. Despite promises of a cleanup, we who had agreed to perform continued to entertain the idea of merely playing spectators that day, a much safer role. Then the carpet was rolled in and once unfurled, five gleeful dancers pou need on it to begin to experience Contact in the wilds of a Richmond alley. Relatively new to Contact, I found alley dancing invigorating. How could I not respond to the fifty-year-old, keyless piano (used as accompaniment for another dance) found amid a pile of Coke bottles, men's Volume 13 1988 shoes, t-shirts, tires, used condoms and other artifacts of American culture? Beneath two trees growing out of brick walls, we tumbled, pushed, pulled, and leaped in response to each other but also in response to the sun, the fresh air and to the angles of the buildings unique to Ram Cat. Whether we were conscious of it or not at the time, our dance was influenced by the environment. We all later agreed how the quality of our moves differed from those performed in our usual wooden floor, high ceiling dance space. The cushion the carpet provided made our more pedestrian moves such as walking and crawling more springy and made falling less threatening. The slight incline of the ground sometimes contributed to the momentum and direction of a roll. Being outdoors, reminiscent of children on recess, allowed us to be more playful. Although we more or less stayed within the confines of the carpet, a space much smaller than what we were used to, the diminished size did not diminish the breadth of our expression. With the idea of performance in mind, we had earlier given ourselves a time limit, but while dancing it was obvious that we didn't want to stop. The rawness of the alley suits Contact. Contact is not sterile or refined, a manufactured product assuaging a public that wants art to be more or less predictable and beautiful, pleasant enough to be displayed like souvenirs from last summer's trip to Europe. Contact is more primitive, disregarding etiquette and incorporating a full range of human expression. Bodies intermingle intimately continually. Bodies graze and press against each other with the ease of a chat and the impassioned eloquence of discourse. The aim of Contact is not to create forms, to reach toward lofty ideals or vulgar ones, but to sustain a gestural communication with another. The product, then, is the result of dancers exchanging their weight and support with integrity, innocence and responsibility. The power of the form originates in its authenticity, in presenting the dance in its moment of becoming. This, it seems, is where the element of improvisation comes in. Improvisation stems from a source that is not solely intellectual but integral. Not only the mind but the body too generates the composition. The Cartesian problem of dualism disappears, neither mind nor body attributed with greater heirarchical importance. The composition is a fusion of the self as whole. Out of this concordance, spontaneous movements arise naturally and last as long as the dancers are able to sustain its many evolutions. More than any other dance form, Contact resembles life, at least my life with its constant flux and need to make decisions within a moment's notice. The improvisational movements are organic, not polished time after time in the studio, and are influenced constantly by whomever I come in contact with. The alley has contributed to the group's general knowledge of Contact. I know also that it affected some of the spectators. Several days after we had danced, a friend of mine mentioned how she had gone to a museum and left after ten minutes. Her reason: the controlled and lifeless environment contradicted the intention of art. She had been touched by the vitality of the alley. [Cheryl Pallant]"

The article provides breathing techniques and exercises to cultivate this awareness, promoting a deeper connection with oneself and one's partner.",
    "Text": "  WITH AWARENESS by Darshana Ellis I've played with dancing and teaching C.I. for about 8 years and something hits me continually-if your own awareness isn't with your self before you touch someone else, it won't feel half as nice and will appear \"not to work.\" We all know the contrast of a dance that culminates in luxurious bliss versus one whose consequence is bruised body or soul. So now, how?: Bringing conscious presence into anything creates meditation (and some very nice dance material). Starting with the rudimentary (thin air), some breathing techniques that help remind us what we're doing: 1) On your own, lying on the back (or front), using the floor for resistant reference, explore the breath's travel into the lower belly, throughout the ribcage and high into the entire lung, chest cavity. This exercise is best verbally guided: anatomical reminders are great, e.g., open around the clavicle, deep into the armpit, ar.ound the sacrum, etc.) 2) In partners, one partner lying on their back, other lies over them perpendicularly, face down, belly to belly. Partner on top may have to take some weight on their elbows and knees for comfort's sake, to begin. Partner on bottom initiates a low, deep, slow belly breath, partner following. Try breathing in opposition, Jetting your partner push the breath out of you then Jetting gravity create space in the belly for the incoming breath. 3) Coming back to the breath. During any contact exercise or warm-up (anytime) if the dancer(s) get sidetracked, lost or sleepy-stop, to come back home, breathe first. 4) Running, one of the best reasons in the world to breathe. I will run 5 miles sometimes just to give my lungs an excuse to breathe. Running backward, downhill, relaxed and breathing softly, is meditation. Indoors, if your space allows, even short runs with the breath slow, deep and relaxed help the body become softer and more quiet in motion. Try sideward and backward relaxed runs, fast and slow, alone and with partners. Like the ultimate in love brings you back to yourself, the ultimate dance form takes you home to your body, heart and awareness. -tr DARSHANA ELLIS is a dancing foal and a teaching cantactar in San Diego, Calif"

    "Abstract": "Susan Schell expresses excitement about the developments in Contact Improvisation between able-bodied and disabled dancers, noting its potential to address elitist tendencies within the form. She emphasizes the importance of commitment to the realities of exchange and attentiveness to oneself and others in creating challenging and growth-producing duets.",
    "Text": "A RESPONSE from Susan Schell I have recently become very excited by developments in Contact between ablebodied and disabled dancers. At A Cappella Motion workshop this past summer there was a v.ideo that Karen [Nelson] and Alito [Alessi] brought from the [Dance With Different Needs] workshop that took place in Oregon and then the report about it in the last issue as well as the articles by Bruce Curtis and Alan Ptashek. This new growth in the form seems to have the potential of shedding light on some of the questions that have surfaced through the years about elitist tendencies in Contact. I have never felt the limitations of the form to be carried by any one person in a dance; rather, it is determined by the willingness of those participating to commit to the realities of their exchange instead of what they wished it would or would not be. I think this kind of attending to oneself and each other can be exhausting or the assumption is that it would be, so an easier duet with ''somebody who can really dance\" is often the option taken. As a result, some of the most potentially challenging and possibly growth producing duets are aborted or avoided altogether. Perhaps it has something to do with our perception of what it means to be challenged. Our skills can be even more limiting than another's lack of skill if we do not find ways to make our experience available to those we dance with. Otherwise, all our much sought after skills begin to isolate us and become the sign posts of exclusion rather than routes of access. This kind of attentiveness to one another and the dancing was palpable for me in both the video that I watched of the workshop and in the writings of Bruce, Alan, Karen and Alito in CQ. I will be very interested to see/ experience the effects of this work on all our dancing in the future. One parting question-what is a \"bad dancer?\" u SUSAN SCHELL has been teaching Contact Improvisation and performing since 1977. She has worked in Authentic Movement for the past six years and is currently co-directing a 9 month intensive program in the form."

    "Abstract": "Steve Paxton discusses the concepts of egalitarianism and hierarchy in Contact Improvisation, responding to Cynthia Novack's columns. He argues that hierarchies are often perceived by those outside them and that criticizing those who organize classes or specialize in Contact Improvisation is to disparage grassroots community work.",
    "Text": "HIERVISIBILITY by Steve Paxton Let me see. I gather egalitarianism and hierarchy are opposed in the title of Cynthia Novack's columns in the last \"Still Moving\" section [\"Egalitarianism and Hierarchy in Contact Improvisation,'' CQ Vol. XIII no. 3]. I fear a trip has been laid on us by some freeassociating dance critic who once described CI as more democratic than other dance forms. I sort of remember that line getting picked up by subsequent reporters-freecwheeling, dance for folk, etc., that kind of image arising uncensored, unexamined and perhaps unverified. In fact, until Novack questioned me recently, I don't recall any of the many dance writers asking about this point. Egalitarianism resulted in democracy, our 'form' of government. This was opposed to monarchy-Geo Washington was offered the monarchy for the states of America, I once learned. So that sort of hierarchy was avoided by democratic government. But a hierarchy, a tern~ porary one, is what we use to run the country. I believe I agree with Dumont's thesis. Agreeing on values creates constraints on individual directions. And humans are a communicating animal-we get jerked out of our path by far more subtle events than agreeing on values. Sometimes for good, sometimes for ill. A pause, a glance will do it. I have noticed that hierarchies are noticed by those outside them. This suggests that those who make them up are to some degree ignorant of that fact, or even that they are projected on a group, or faction, or gathering, or team, or committee by someone who perceives the association as hier-. Or rather, higher. Now no one in these stories is dead; Zimmer, Elias, Ryan, Harwqod or myself; it would be possible to ask some direct questions of all of us. For instance, who organized the situation Zimmer attended? I'll bet Ryan had a hand in it. Harwood and Ryan are both movers and shakers in the Canadian Contact Improv. scene and it seems to me no Contact scene could exist without deep bonds existing-I mean people must enjoy dancing together in order to have it survive for over a decade. Zimmer probably wasn't the only beginner who wanted to whet their skills on those two, and probably not the only one to emotionally defer to their skills. Elias says there was definitely a sense of in-group and out-group at the Current Exchange gathering [in Vancouver, B.C., summer 1979]. I can vouch that there was such a situation. The in-group photos: Natanja den Boeh consisted of any one who had a long association with the idea of CI and had toured and/or taught with the others. The out-group were in such a group for the first time. They were a bit at sea. They didn't know how to act and since there are no rules as such, no one told them. The nice things about rules, schedules, etc. is that they limit the number of choices one has to make. If one may act any old way, a bewildering situation may exist. Those who weren't bewildered were in. Those who were bewildered saw themselves as out. If Current Exchange was elitist, it was Volume 14 1989 only in the sense that the entire U.S. and Canada was not invited. In fact, living conditions restricted the size. Word was quietly put out to a few people who told a few other people. A letter of intent from participants was required to insure they had their own reason for using the facility (Western Front Lodge/ gallery I studio/ video) and that their reason resonated with the facility and harmonized in practical ways with the rest. Every one of us paid for the rent of Western Front and pitched in for food, cooking and cleaning up. I fear that the article, in using these two examples, will give elitism a bad name. Surely just being a small group or being buddies is not cause to bring out such a big gun. To be elite is to hold some plum and restrict its dispersal. To use this word to criticize those who go to the trouble of organizing classes or who attempt to specialize and concentrate is to disparage a kind of grass roots community work. Zimmer and Elias will be amused to learn that they have been placed in an elite, at the top of a hierarchy, recently. In Berlin at the 4th annual Contact Conference (they decided to drop the word 'improvisation', to my despair). A European delegate asked if all Europeans could do with Contact was repeat what the first generation had done. So it goes. Zimmer and Elias are, to Europe, first generation contactors. And this is an example of a hierarchy being perceived from without. Truth be told, CI is a dance form. It does have and, as far as I am concerned, teach certain values; mostly to do with physical safety. CI has always abounded in logical contradictions, foremost to do with improvisation. If improvisation springs out of each moment in each individual, then how to get people to improviseto discover their own initiative? And I point this out in classes-this cannot be taught, but it can be learned. I can help with the physical part. I can provide useful (to me, at least) images and meditations. I can point out glaring errors in partnering. I can't know how someone feels or protect them from their insecurity, fear, dislikes, associations, boredom, or their elation, warmth, sense of achievement, for that matter. Contact Improvisation deals with gravity, momentum, human bodies, etc. Humans form or perceive hierarchies. It is egalitarian. The folk who aren't in Contact Improvisation, either don't know about it or choose not to do it. To pick at words just a bit more, Contact Improvisation could not have \"embraced values of individualism, equality, and anti-hierarchical relationships,'' because CI cannot do anything. It is something to be done. And in Dumont's remark some strange loose ends, which perhaps should be brought to the attention of the U.S. government and of course, its boss, the people: \"If, in effect, the whole of humanity is deemed present in each man, then each man should be free and all men are equal. By contrast, as soon as a collective end is adopted by several men, their liberty is limited and their equality is brought into question.\" So apparently even a government formed on values such as freedom and equality will trample on freedom and equality. How embarassing. Yet even such an experiment in good intentions is of some interest, compared to the intentions of other governments, then and now. If liberty and equality are chosen, then at the moment of choice, they exist. What happens the next moment is something for all of us, anthropologists especially, to ponder. * STEVE PAXTON is an inveterate Contactor who is interested in improvisation."

    "Text": "Berlin-A personal view by Kevin Finnan I digress, there had been fears that there might be a language problem, but luckily everyone spoke English and anyone who did not, did not speak. This compromise was working wonderfully until a frustrated German listener, unable to contain himself, spoke out somewhat testily at the first panel discussion. Luckily, he did so in German. Thus all the English speakers, completely unable to understand him, could continue on without noticing. \"Vive la Difference,\" whatever that means! By now the conference was in full swing. The spartan life of eating, dancing, eating, dancing, eating talking, eating, eating was taking its toll. In the case of yours truly the old adage \"free food makes Jack a fat boy\" was not heeded-alas! Thus several unsuspecting partners were crushed to a fraction of their normal volume when dancing with moi, and several sackloads of health food. Allegations of a covert operation by German dance to elevate its European status by reducing the rest of us to bulging bean bags were hotly denied. At the second panel discussion, which was on the topic of performance, a furor broke out. Members of the panel were apparently attempting to perform during the discussion. Order was only restored when the panel was persuaded to return to the sedentary you-listen-we-talk format. It had taken a courageous lone voice to bring back sanity to the proceedings. It has long been known that performance is not a viable method of communication after all! I, mercifully, was spared the whole indignity as I had a pressing engagement with a dinner table in another part of town. A quote that rang clearly through my mind came on the last day. Someone, who shall remain nameless, (after all who am I to point the finger) but who definitely was not me, observed dryly that \"the conference had been entitled 'Issues for the Nineties', but as far as anyone could see it was \"Whatever happened to the Sixties.\""

Rich, poor, east, west, Berlin-the divided city. This is extremely handy as any fellow tourist will tell you! What would be an insurmountable tourist problem, is divided into easily touristable sections. The East, ever mindful of its responsibilities has erected a handy wall and effiCient turnstiles, very similar to the Disneyland model. One always knows where one is. Everything appears to be produced by the same company and everything is so extremely cheap. So cheap in fact one has extreme difficulty cashing in all those cute little chips that allow you to go on any of the rides. Sadly however, the West does not show the same sort of responsibility. The American, British and French sectors are almost indistinguishable. No walls to keep out the non-paying. No efficient tour guides. I for instance, was completely unable to find the German sector.

    "Text": "California Contact Jmprov. Jam Harbin Hot Springs, Nov. 88 Home, I sit at the breakfast table, overwhelmed with grief. Leaving Harbin and the incredible sense of community that we gradually built was very sad for me. I didn't acknowledge it until Monday morning. I was listening to Whales Alive and the singing back and forth of the whales made me intensely aware that our gathering was over and the migration back to the working grounds, like whale feeding grounds, was a very lonely process. Fortunately, we have a contact community in San Diego now. Three of us went to Harbin: Darshana Ellis, Bruce Gardner and myself. So we have each other as a support group. Two others are regulars in our community: Annete Frei and Laurelia Barton. We will be processing the learning of this Harbin for quite awhile. Some ideas that come up follow. Mixer: The round robin is inefficient for giving everyone a chance to dance. It is common for many of us to have an inner dialogue that goes like this: \"They look so good,\" \"I don't want to interrupt,\" \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'm tired, cold   , \" \"Neither of them like me,\" and \"They haven't had a long enough turn.\" This kind of taped message goes through my mind over and over again. I have to contradict my mind to get into a round robin. This becomes less of an issue when I begin to know I'm accepted. Then again sometimes the inner messages are confirmed. In a mixer format, everyone is encouraged to dance with someone they have never danced with before for a fixed time interval, then everyone switches to another unfamiliar dancer. This happens in \"class\" settings regularly but I think it should be used to introduce an evening of dance. There are no \"I'm interrupting\" or \"long enough turn\" messages to deal with. And this process helps to overcome the \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'm cold and tired\" excuses. A set time interval is very important so that everyone switches at the same time. Perhaps the use of a bell or music to cue people to the switch process is appropriate. 0"

    "Text": "There are those who rigidly oppose structure at all costs. I agree that improvisation in its purest form should dominate. But I have strong feelings of compassion for the newcomers to contact who are overwhelmed by the beauty of the more experienced dancer and the close bonding and subgrouping that is common in contact communities. Nude Dancing: For the first time at Harbin, we had a nude contact session that occurred spontaneously on Friday night. I was overwhelmed by inner dialogue, \"How will my body react to even greater sensuality than the already incredibly sensuous contact dance form?\" The beauty of this session finally overcame my inhibitions and I truly enjoyed the freedom. It was like the first skinny dipping at the beach. Although I'm thankful for this experience, I have mixed feelings: (1) what will outsiders think, (2) will the wrong kind of people be attracted to our community if nude dancing becomes commonplace, (3) many community members stopped dancing when the nude dancing began, (4) many people were subtly criticized for objecting. Some thoughts for future occurrences: (1) I will not encourage nude dancing at Harbin with any regularity, (2) if the community agrees to a nude dance, I will strongly encourage a non-prime time, contained setting that will not disrupt the community function, (3) this should never be advertised in any way because of the potential disruption from outsiders. Notes on my nude dance experience: It was like velcro and silk. Initially I felt glued to my partner like velcro. This permits some unusual perches and unexpected locks. Then the perspiration set in and I slide around like sliding the length of the high school shower on my butt. It wasn't that bad but I never knew when I would stick or slip. I perspire heavily so I became concerned over others slipping on my slicks so I stopped, but not before rocking back on my back for a long slide across the floor. My dances with men were shorter than usual and I had some inner reservations like those I went through when I first started dancing with my community brothers long ago. Renewal (Welcoming) Ceremony: Initially getting together for the first community meeting needs more grounding spiritually. We seem to get too cerebral with names. I would appreciate repeating some of the closing rituals from the last Harbin so that we can honor the continuity of the community and show newcomers some of the results of the last community gathering. When the Native Americans joined for the Sun Dance, they began with ceremonies that evolved in the course of centuries to honor the community and to ritually bond each tribe member.

June 8th and 9th were days for registration and open dancing as well as reunions with friends, and acquainting oneself with parts of Berlin. Most people had arrived by the evening of Thursday 9th for an official welcoming and introductions at the new studio at Tanzfabrik. One studio had been put aside as a 'Video Cafe' and quiet room where, throughout the conference, videos of contact-related work were being shown informally. Friday 10th June began with OPEN JAMS in three studios at the Tanzfabrik. On Friday afternoon, NANCY STARK SMITH and ROBIN FELD led two separate WORKSHOPS-\"Developing the Form\" and \"Contact and Martial Dance.\" On Saturday afternoon, ISHMAEL HOUSTON-JONES led a workshop on the Politics of dancing, while PAULINE DE GROOT led one on improvised dance and music. On Friday and Saturday evening after dinner, there were two PANEL DISCUSSIONS. The topicfor Friday was 'Teaching' and Nancy Stark Smith moderated, assisted by Steve Paxton [see excerpts from this discussion in this Newsletter]. People on the panel included ROBIN FELD, BOB REASE, LOUISE RICHARDS, BRUNO STEFANONI, BERND KAMMERER, and GILA ROGERS. The discussion looked at questions in teaching such as the definition of a teacher, language and Contact, sexuality and aggression within sessions, and Contact in Therapy. Bernd spoke of his difficulties in the translation from English into German, of the concepts and practice of Contact. He had learnt Contact in English and was teaching it in German. Bernd was voicing an experience of teaching which must be common to all those teachers of Contact for whom English is not their first spoken language. It was added that it helps to use language which is part of the lives of the people being taught, to teach concepts of Contact in ways which will make it accessible for them. Steve Paxton said that his first concern when teaching Contact was how to teach it without people hurting themselves. Robin Feld described how she uses the breath to encourage the release· and flow of weight in her teaching. Using imagery such as melting, softening and folding at the joints all helps to encourage a safe physical environment for doing Contact. Louise, who teaches Contact with Kevin Finnan in high security prisons, said that changing from a dispersed to a focussed activity can also prevent injury in a session. The question \"what are you teaching when you are teaching Contact?\" was linked with finding a definition of a teacher. STEVE BATTS spoke of sharing an investigation with his students. He directs but may not know the outcome of the activity. He brought up the element of improvising in teaching, so that possibilities may be explored by teacher and learner together. \"What about feeling and emotion in Contact?\" This brought up some important issues. Steve Paxton talked about how emotion may or may not be acknowledged in dance. He spoke of how Contact arose in a dance context, within which people such as Martha Graham and Jose Limon were dealing with emotion, and making it into form. Paxton was drawn to Merce Cunningham, because Cunningham's dancing ethic was more abstract and he dealt with shape, form, space and time-the physics of dancing. This was more intellectual and there was less drama, less expression of emotions. In physics there is gravity, momentum, shape, angles and as physics is present in dancing, so are the emotions, \"but we don't know how to deal with it, teach it, make it into a form.\" This was difficult for Kevin Finnan who explained that he taught Contact to criminals who have killed children and adults, including their relations, and these 'students' learn Contact and talk about it afterwards. I think there was some confusion here between finding forms for emotional expression in daily life, and finding emotional forms for dance, although the distinction can sometimes be difficult. Contact in therapy was an issue which was also discussed, and Gila Rogers, a dancer who is also a psychotherapist, explained how she combined Developmental work with Contact in her treatment of emotionally disturbed people and how effective Contact can be in her work generally. On the following evening, the topic for the panel discussion was 'Performing Contact-Working with Personal Material'. Steve Paxton moderated, assisted by Nancy Stark Smith. The discussion began with an infqrmal jam for the panel who were PAULINE DE GROOT, LAURIE BOOTH, BOB REASE, DIETER HEITKAMP, ISHMAEL HOUSTON-JONES, MARK TOMPKINS and JAAP KLEVERING. When the dancing had subsided, some people found seats to sit on, while others continued improvising while the discussion took place. After about an hour, there was a break and the panel rearranged their chairs closer to the audience and remained seated. Steve began by asking each person on the panel to say a little about themselves, and their work. He also asked them whether they had danced in a Broadway show or musical, which had run for more than three nights, or if they had danced on a boat, and whether they performed set material or improvised material. I was occupied with taping the discussion and taking photos so my notes are scarce. However, I have down that Laurie Booth was interested in aberrant behaviour as movement in performance, describing aberrant as marginalized or unusual activity. He recounted an incident which he was witness to at the zoo that morning, where a monkey had made history by imitating a film cameraman to the point where the monkey was making a film of everybody looking at him inside his cage. (I think this is what he meant, although the cameraman may have given the monkey the equipment to make a film). Ishmael had never danced any set material, and Steve was alone in danc~ng in a sh~w which repeated itself for many nights running. JORGEN TELLER asked whether improvisation can become a collection of anecdotes from learned forms. Steve replied, \"Be careful of what you're taught, every step you've ever learned is stored in the body, and pieces will emerge when you're least exJ pecting it.\" There was a lot of discussion around defining the form of Contact Improvisation. A definitive statement of Steve's: \"Forms exist to follow, but you're less than human if you don't try to break them.\" This panel discussion began at 8pm and was going strong at 11 :30pm when I left. There were tapes made of it which would hopefully be obtainable at the Tanzfabrik. The NETWORKING COMMUNITY MEETING began at lOam on Sunday morning, with sunshine streaming through the window of the studio. We decided that the next European Contact Teacher's Conference would take place from the 10th-17th August 1989 in Finland, and Jaap Klevering and Jaana Turunen would be organizing it. in Cyprus and Walter Weiler offered to organize one for Zurich, Switzerland. Dieter Heitkamp was interested in compiling a kind of journal to document responses to and feelings about the conference in Berlin. In the last part of the meeting we all shared something of this with the rest of the group. Here are some of the things that were said: How to begin dancing with strangers. Was this a conference or a symposium. The founders of Contact dance don't know the definition of it. The conference was part of Issues for the Nineties and we spent most of the time talking about the '60s and '70s. At no time did anyone say OK that's what Contact is. To make a group at this conference to talk about personal, social and political issues surrounding Contact dancing. That a large group of people should learn how to listen to each other. It is a political act to go and see how the Berliners live instead of attending the conference-this is as important as being 'in the stars'. There is no personal communication after such intimacy. To create more opportunities for personal work to develop. The psychology of the outsider-a celebration. To sustain a network between conferences. Wanting to have nothing to do with the 'hippy, pseudo cult' which Contact could become and to keep Contact available for all people. The \"BERLIN JAM\" on Sunday afternoon was an opportunity for open dancing among people outside of the conference and those in it, and new energy and faces meant revived dancing, for me anyway. It was a welcome change from the highly structured events of the conference, and reminded me of the two days open jamming before the conference began. I enjoyed the Sunday afternoon novelty of that jam and was glad of the opportunity to dance with new people. That night was the party, and Dieter transformed the biggest studio with some spotlights and a sound system into a disco. On Monday morning a group of us went to a cafe together. At the Contact Networking meeting Mark Tompkins suggested that people get together and talk about the personal, social and political issues that they experienced in dance and particularly Contact dance. It was a small group and there was the chance to talk quite personally which was a relief. The group was small enough for some close personal communication to take place and I feel that this is what the conference, by virtue of its size, failed to provide for, except in this group and outside of the structured ti me. The PERFORMANCE MARATHON was from 1 pm to 6pm that afternoon. This event was open to the public and everyone paid 15 marks toward it for the Berliner Aids Hilfe. In the first half there were solos, duets and one or two group pieces. This half was quite organized, in that there was a predetermined order to the pieces. There were improvisations and set pieces in this part of the marathon, including new collaborations. After the break, the space was basically open except there was a structure which Pauline ignored or forgotten as time w;nt by. When one of the musicians left, sound became the domain of the dancers who accompanied themselves from around the space or within it, talking and singing, or using tapes or playing the percussion instruments that were available. The space was nearly always pretty well full of activity and there were one or two solos and at one point there were about twenty people in the space. The marathon was the last organized event of the conference, although most people would be attending the PERFORMANCES of STEVE PAXTON and LISA NELSON, and LAURIE BOOTH that evening in another part of Berlin. But it was the end of the conference at the Tanzfabrik and so those of us who were there sat in a circle together for two minutes of silence to acknowledge an ending with Dieter, Bob and Bruno. I would like to finish with some quotes by KERIAC from an article called \"Politics and Contact\" in an old issue of CQ: . whv was this form named Contact Improvisation and not Steve Paxton Technique? In the entire modem dance world, every new approach except Contact is based on a cult of personality: Graham technique, Cunningham technique, Hawkins technique, etc . .. to me, that name is revolutionary-it reflects a whole new value system in dance. . I understand that Paxton was a teacher at Bennington at the time he began exploring Contact, and that his co-workers were mostly students. And yet, if two people try to do Contact while maintaining the typical student-teacher relationship, I think those two wouldn't end up doing much Contact at all. Both the name and the form itself assume that Contact is a collective creation that is bigger than individuals. There is a letting go of ego, and a letting go of traditional role expectations, that is unprecedented in dance. .. Contact began with the progressive, antielitist values of its inventors. But third and fourth generation contacters, who may have little or no contact with the originators, now outnumber the originators as teachers of the form. It's quite possible to teach someone 'Contact' in the physical dimension only, without any conscious reference to values, or even in relation to values that conflict with the form. To me, it's important for teachers of Contact to cultivate in themselves and in their students a heightened awareness of the political and spiritual richness of this form of dance. .. I think we in the Contact community have a unique opportunity to foster the revolutionary model that was generated by the Contact originators. We can validate the activities that do not conform to the traditional expectations, because our own experience in Contact has given us intimations of another type of 'good quality performance' . .. we can perceive performers as real people in real time, making choices that have physical results neither good nor bad, rather than applauding 'stars' whose image would be ruined by a 'mistake'.\" [from \"Politics and Contact,\" interview with Keriac by Mark Pritchard, San Francisco 1979, CQ Vol. Vil no. 7.

    "Abstract": "Martin Keogh discusses the use of imagery in teaching Contact Improvisation, emphasizing its power to enhance the dance experience. He provides a list of evocative images that he has used in his own dancing and classes.",
    "Text": "In the ancient fairy tales there is often a character walking in the woods where he meets a man (often named Mercurius, one of the names of Hermes) who gives three gifts. These might include a bottle of wine that is never empty, or a cane that will open any door, or a cloth that will heal any illness. A gift that is often given is the cloak of invisibility. One of the images I often wear as I'm dancing is this cloak. I try not to interpret the image or figure out how it applies to my dance, I simply wear it, and the dance changes. In teaching Contact Improvisation, I have found images to be invaluable for getting at the soul of our dance. It is possible to give physical corrections and teach techniques but I have found that it is the imagery that brings down mountains and sets the oceans ablaze. The images are sometimes descriptive and sometimes prescriptive. I will often flesh them out with a story or other images but they don't come with an explanation. Here is a list of images, some that I have used in my own dancing and some that I have given in my classes: sleeping beauty after the kiss the sand in an hourglass sausages for bones an empty scale seeing through fish eyes -Atlas after putting down the world think of yourself as a timeless piece of literature -hunter after big game deep in the jungle and the lions have just come into view bread rising and overflowing the bowl resplendent robes, jewels and crown of a king at the bottom of the exhale is when the lights go on pancake batter spreading as it's poured patina cracking and peeling off greenhouse for winter blossoms in the chest head and shoulders like a mop -you have no forehead an old crone who has seen it all the reverence, standing in a grand cathedral with sunlight streaming in flowing skirt, longgggg hair, dangling earrings, dozen bracelets, emerald in bellybutton, tattoo of a rose on the thigh filled with cooking"

He discusses how Contact has influenced his understanding of intimacy, trust, and the connection between physical and emotional well-being.",
    "Text": "In my life as an animal, Contact Improvisation has been one of the brightest illuminations, helping me in the search for wisdom, happiness and the meanings of life. Contact has been a catalyst in my relation to the world, opening my dancing and giving me a world to dance in. Since I was a small child I have surfed on the urge to create little worlds of my own. I have been producer and director, writer and performer, designer and clean-up crew over and over in order to dwell in the magic reality of an altered, imagined society. Contact, in its allabsorbing concentration of attention and array of options, gave me hope and an example of physical/metaphysical freedom. I hungered to expand the inward state of being in the flow of movement, turn it inside-out and make an arena of total involvement. In 1982 I began going to jack-off parties. Lessons about weight and ?u~render, momentum and timing, mt1macy and respect for the partner vital in Contact were also vital amidst hot, horny men eager to play together. In both Contact and the j/o scene, trust, good humor and sensitive touch invite the interpersonal rapport, and generate above and beyond the physical sharing an atmosphere of generous welcome. Unwilling to be merely a participant, I felt my dictatorial drives push me to become an organizer of the San Francisco JACKS in 1984 and the next year I was one of th~ circle of radical artists who aimed to conquer the epidemic of FADS (Fear, Anger, Doubt and Sorrow) by becoming the Healing Order of Kthar Sissies. The party animal within me emerged as Dogtor Woof! Semiremide and I began to administrate, mediate and realize clinics, parties, rituals and ceremonies dedicated to healing of the self and the planet. Dance had become movement, theatre had become paratheatre, my Contact group had become a support network and dining club; as the '80s rolled along, religion, money, art and sex twisted and turned into something almost coherent, something like a big jewel lighting my way. For the last four years, my endeavors have included mixed events for men and women, of gay, lesbian, bisexual, heterosexual, wild, shy, s/m and other persuasions widening my outlook and expa~ding my provincialism beyond the exclusively gay men's milieu. Recently I went to a Contact weekend where I discovered many folks deeply embroiled in anxieties about intimacy, attraction and other psychoerotic phenomena within the context of our movement form. At last, I thought, my studies might apply to the world of Contact, where I got so many good ideas in the first place. Currently I am looking for ways to offer some of the lore I have won to contactors who once again surround me. I am meditating on drills, exercises, articulations of some of the attraction/repulsions, curiosities, fears and delights movers· report that verge on and merge with the psychoerotic. In private practice as a planet therapist, I use breath, mas~age, movement and counseling, seekmg to heal psychic wounds, as many of us have been doing all along, directly and indirectly. The duet of the skeleton and the breath once my vision of the Contact dan~e, has another dimension, crisscrossed and united with the duet of the personality and the aura. Attractions to certain partners r~sistances that lead to challenge~, difficulties leading to triumphs, the darknesses required for stars to shine in: these are among my current considerations. How these notions apply to Contact, how Contact applies to me and others, how by dancing our best we can heal ourselves and the planet: these are among my favorite thinks. Found in a spin, loving the spin I'm in, I remain your admiring student and pal, relaying radiant blessings!

    "Abstract": "This article presents a transcript of a discussion at the 2nd California Contact Festival, facilitated and edited by Martin Keogh and Kirk Andrews, exploring the 'shadow' aspects of Contact Improvisation. Participants delve into uncomfortable and often repressed issues related to sexuality, power dynamics, community, and personal vulnerabilities within the form.",
    "Text": "transcript of a discussion at the 2nd California Contact Festival, 6/10/89, facilitated, edited and revised by Martin Keogh and Kirk Andrews In the issue that had \"Questions Not to Ask\" [by Danny Lepkoff, CQ Vol. 13:3], you put out the call for some \"meaty discussion.\" I think this will provoke just that. Over the months of working on this, I have gone through feelings that range from elation to alarm. Looking at the form has reflected back on myself and a lot of my own issues that are crying out for attention. I hope that by putting this material out to the community at large, it will evoke the same for others. [M.K.] Keogh: A few months ago I had the idea of having a discussion on the shadow of Contact. I told Kirk, and he said he was thinking of doing a panel on sexuality and Contact. We agreed they were related, and decided to put them together. We spent a lot of time reaching into what we thought the shadow was for ourselves personally, and for the form as a whole. We came up with an image that poet Robert Bly uses to describe the shadow. He sees it as a big bag that we drag behind us. When something is too painful to deal with, or there is something we don't want to look at, we throw it in the bag. When we were children, we threw a lot of who we were into the bag from parental and teacher disapproval and their desire for us to be good little boys and girls. And as adults we continue to fill the bag. For some of us the bag is so long that they're all blocked up in the doorway. Kirk asked me, \"Why do you want to delve into this shadow material?\" I thought about this and realized that it's because I feel married to this form of dance. It would be easy to trance out or go on automatic and not confront the stuff that over the years of dancing I've put into the bag. Sometimes when I'm in a duet and a beautiful moment opens up, an opportunity for a spontaneous ride, I say, 'Wait a minute while I get my bag', and then the moment is lost. Hopefully, by mucking around in the muddled and uncomfortable aspects of the shadow, we can get some stuff out of the bag, so the dance can continue to open up. Andrews: The term 'shadow' has been used for thousands of years as a literary metaphor for the dark side, the underworld of life. Carl Jung, of Analytic Psychology fame, then picked it up and used it as a more poetic way to describe information that we repress and keep down. There are a lot of things that we have inside us that we don't show to the outside world. Jung said we have a \"persona\" character that we like to show, and then a bunch of \"shadow\" characters which are kept hidden. The shadow is full of these characters. A lot of them are quite creative and powerful (i.e., the thief, the witch, the tyrant) but we are taught that they are unacceptable. When we work on integrating the shadow characters, by talking about them, and bringing them into conscious awareness, we release a lot of energy that has been trapped there. The annoying thing is that just when we think we have the shadow uncovered and figured out, it changes into another form. Integrating the shadow therefore becomes a lifelong process of looking within ourselves. We hope this discussion today will help us to bring out some of these shadow issues that are very real but also very difficult to talk about. Keogh: One aspect is my pers~nal shadow in the dance: \"What am I bnnging that I'm not wanting to look at?\" Then there is the shadow that is inherent in the form itself. I've noticed as we have looked at some of this, that sometimes the material is offensive. The ones I take offense at, the ones I get defensive about, the ones where I say, \"No, that's not what Contact is about,'' are the ones I need to look at most carefully. We want to start by shining a bright light at Contact so the shadow can become nice and long and clear. Take a moment to think of what you like best about Contact, what brings you to the form? Participants: • The incredible playfulness of everybody• Trust•. Connection • Release • Cooperation • Resonance• Total contact with someone • I feel like I get to be more fully me than in anything else I do • Because it helps bring out the shadow side of me • Confronting my fear and my sense of limitation • Physical and emotional risk • Surprise • Touch • Freedom to push • The accepted intimacy • I love the sensuality • The vitality • Inspiration to be creative in all of my life • Getting energy from non-energy• It's a metaphor for all my relationships • Spontaneity • Athleticism• Sportsmanship• Meditation • Recognition • Keogh: These statements demonstrate why we love this form. Because we. l?ve it we think it's healthy to turn a cntical e;e towards the form and our participation in it. One way that Kirk and I have been working on this is to look at what we like then delve into what's behind that. If.I like how playful everybody is, does that suggest we have a group of people who refuse to grow up? If this idea bothers you, you might be near the shadow. Today, let that be a guide. Here are five questions to work with in your small groups: • What do I deny or repress to do this form? • What do I like too much about this form? • What do I experience in this form that I don't like to acknowledge? •What's missing for me in this form? •What's missing in the Contact community? (The group splits into eight small groups who talk with different levels of animation. We get back together.) Keogh: We would like to hear a few statements from each group. The rest of us will try to hold back the impulse to make it all better, or say you're wrong, or you're ok, or that's not my experience. We will just try to hear it. Group one: We talked about two main categories. One was sexuality and the other, community. There is a blurred distinction between sensuality and eroticism, and the lines often blur in the dance. . . One person said that sometimes women he'd be dancing with spoke about feeling aggressive sexuality from their male partners, and they didn't know how to deal with it, and usually would excuse themselves to go get water. Participant: Uh oh, you blew thefr cover now. Group one: With community, the individual often judging what the community wanted from them. It came back to not knowing who you are yourself, changing how you act to fit the community. Group two: Honesty vs. niceness, how do you let someone know you dislike them and don't want to dance with them. Is it better to be honest and just tell them so, or be nice   Culture came up. A lot of us seem to be from the same background   Everyone in our group is involved in academic institutions, and really get into our heads, is this a haven for our bodies to express themselves? Group three: What do I experience that I don't like to acknowledge?: fear of physical danger, of rejection and vulnerability. How do I judge who I dance with or don't dance with and how do I tell them? Men holding back their weight from women   What's missing for me in this form?: The completeness of the intimacy. This sense that it is ok to be intimate within certain parameters but it doesn't extend even to sometimes saying goodbye to someone after class. One of the most frustrating parts of this form is describing it to people who don't know it. A definition!   What do I like too much about this form?: Again, intimacy, sensuality, letting go of the mind, just sort of checking out or o.d.ing on the experience, not knowing when to stop just because 'it's there'   What do I deny to do this form?: fear of physical danger. Sexuality: the fear of being exposed, fear of rejection, of not looking good, the judgement that I don't know how to do it. The judgement that I am not trained enough to do it. .. What's lacking in the community?: a lack of professionalism, in presentations and facilities. Group four: We talked about feeling vulnerable about approaching people and feeling insecurity around skill levels   Someone had discomfort dancing with the opposite sex, and had a desire to know them better to feel more trust before dancing with them   The difficulty of making eye contact while dancing, which seems paradoxical in such an intimate situation   Someone was disturbed by the lack of blacks and minority groups. Group five: Somebody asked does anybody feel grief or other strong emotions while doing Contact? We had all had some intense experience, either remembering something from our childhood, or something that made us want to cry. . . We talked about how difficult it is to do Contact and be in a relationship. Both with a partner who does Contact or one who doesn't. How do you communicate to your partner that this is only Contact, we're not having sex here   We also talked about how the community is very homogeneous. We are mostly white, well educated, and lacking ethnic cultures and people with handicaps. Group six: We talked about talking too much about emotions and the kind of philosophical baggage that comes with the form. Why do we have these kinds of discussions? Both perspectives of it being baggage and opportunity. . . We talked about fears of intimacy, liking parts of the form too much, so it goes into a dangerous area, such as liking being touched too much, and then becoming dependent on it. We talked about dreams. Group seven: We talked about snobbisms in the community. That fashion awareness is very repressed   and some liked too much the availability of attractive women. (lots of varied reactions) Group eight: Injuries; people feeling they are put aside and not talked about even though they very much affect the form   We also talked about the community as a whole not having a defined sense of what Contact is, and letting it develop and grow out of that, it's a \"free for all\" kind of deal. Participant: Contact also has a smugness about it, vis a vis the modern dance community. It's a mutual thing, we often say modern dance is very mechanical, and something is missing in it. And about Contact, their's is a thread about a lack of discipline, a lack of professionalism, focus, we take refuge in our own spontaneity and structurelessness and our unwillingness to work with crafting things. Andrews: Any time you put out that you are better than someone else, one has to wonder if the shadow part is saying, \"We feel less than   \" Keogh: Kirk and I have come up with some statements, or \"judgements\" about Contact that we hope will bring some of the shadow out into the light. Some are more serious than others. We would like to put these out, and then we can make the impossible jump of trying to at least resolve our talk today. After we came up with this list we split them into four categories: •Power • •The Form • Gender & Sexuality • Personal (a catchall for those that are hard to categorize) We decided not to put these down as questions but as statements. We will start with the Power category: •We are always in a supportive role with one another, seldom in a conflict role. There's very little conflict in this community. Participant:   little that gets expressed anyway. (laughter) Keogh: • We are all big fish in a little pond and there are no predators. Because the form is about support and flowing and acknowledging, the form attracts people who aren't very powerful. • We are people with a complete lack of boundaries. • There is no overt competition, there are no levels of attainment, no accolades to be reached. So you can do this form forever and never get any acknowledgement for it. • We are a group who tends to have a failure streak. (heated reaction) Participant: Is there any group that doesn't? Keogh: Remember, we don't have to defend the form right now. • No one in our community is outstanding or excels in their own field. (more heated reaction) Participant: What are these???? Keogh: These are statements. Participant: That someone else made, that you made, that you believe, that someone believes??? Keogh: These are possible shadow statements. Some of them we came up with looking at what is good about Contact, some are our own speculation, some we heard from others, and some are from people looking at the form from the outside. Participant: Ahhhhh! That explains it! (laughter) Andrews: These are generalizations. Participant: I have a difficult time with some. Andrews: That may be a sign that they are in your shadow, we usually don't like, and are critical of, what we hold in the shadow. Participant: I want you to take responsibility as the person who reads these statements. It's like someone else is trying to define who I am, and I resent that. I ask that the person reading these put them in an \"I\" form. Andrews: That's a good thing to say but our answer is no. I hear what you want and we talked a lot about how to do this. Keogh: We decided that because the form is so supportive and \"I\" based and nonconfrontive that we would simply put these out as statements. Andrews: They include us, but I can't take responsibility for them all because I don't believe them all. This is to fuel the discussion. We are not saying, this is how you are, or how the form is, but these are possibilities of our shadow in this form. If these statements don't apply to you, just let them go by with a laugh. If they draw a reaction from you,_ it is worth reflecting on your reaction. That is a part of our purpose. Keogh: Under the category of The Form: • There is no connection in this form between discipline and art. It makes no artistic statement. • There's a hierarchy based on who gets the highest rides, who shows off the best. • It is a form for latent gays and perverts. • We suffer from naive idealism, with ideas of egalitarianism and \"organic process.\" Andrews: In the Gender and Sexuality category: • We're getting off on breaking the incest taboo. We get to have a kind of sexual experience with lots and lots of people who are more family than lovers. • Men are better at Contact than women. (oohs and laughter) • It fosters an androgynous sexuality. It turns men into women and women into men. Keogh: Look at our apparel. Andrews: • The emotional and the sexual get cut off to do this dance. Under the Personal category: • One thing I don't like to acknowledge is that I'm good at this form.

(moan) • This issue of everyone being so playful and not wanting to grow up. The Peter Pan syndrome. Participants: Hallelujah! I Let's just change the definition of growing up I some of this stuff doesn't sound like shadow but conscious choices. Andrews: Like we said, there's a lot of creativity and pow:r in the shadow. Participant: Whenever we talk about sexuality /intimacy, getting into our bodies, we take on the morality we grew up with, rather than celebrating this thing that brings up our feelings of intimacy, that nurtures us, that fills the gaps, the holes where we feel unloved. I feel when we talk about this, it's as if we are getting off on something we shouldn't. I'd like to see more of a sense of celebration over these things. Andrews: That is true, and, for right now we are here to dig up the muck more than to celebrate. Participant: I like that. I'm not saying we shouldn't be digging. I just wanted to say that the terms sexuality and sensuality always get lumped into the muck. Participant: We have to dig them up to celebrate them. Participant: I see the focus on two forms of shadow. There's our own internal blockages, that may get in the way of the dance (or help the dance). And then there is this cultural stuff that we grew up with. IN essence, we are here to turn that stuff upside down and explore the side of it we never got to see the first 20 or 30 or 40 years of our lives. The culture is driven by fanaticism on a certain level, the fanaticism of dominating the world and repressing our feelings about that. Here we are turning it upside down: it's not our place to be powerful out in the world in a driving way. We can't challenge what's out there with the same behavior as that which we are challenging. So, it's very appropriate, at this stage in the evolution of the form and the community to be very introspective and visible. Keogh: I feel we're trying to elevate this material. I don't think we are ready to do that. We haven't been down in the shadow long enough yet. Participant: I noticed my emotional responses to some of these statements. Some went right by and others got stuck in me. Like hearing an old judgement I used to have about myself from the culture. Boy, there was a lot of reaction happening among us in response to many of these. I would encourage everybody to look at the ones you had the most inner discomfort with and ask what's happening here. Clearly there's a lack of resolution around a lot of these issues. I appreciate the statements being read the way they were because they were spoken the way my internal judge speaks them. Andrews: One of the benefits of looking at the shadow is you get a lot of energy back. If we are powerless, the power is in the shadow, if we are playful, the adult is in the shadow, if we are shy and afraid, the confident one is in the shadow. It makes it worthwhile to go there. Secondly, I think it's important for our community to look at the shadow and look at what's missing in order to be a real community and not a pseudo community that's superficial. Call it community maintenance. We can't say, \"Oh, we talked about that last year,\" and then let it go. We have to keep working with it. One of the things that I want to acknowledge is that our community does a good job of talking about issues. That has been especially true at some of the Harbin jams. Hopefully today will have raised up some questions that we can continue to work with. This is an ongoing process, seek out a friend if you need to talk with someone. We need to close for now. Keogh: Before we get active, let's sit quietly for a moment and review what this discussion has evoked. * Special thanks to Dawn Weiss and Dan Matson for transcribing the tapes of this event."

The author discusses the organizers, the inspiration behind the jam, its growth and evolution, and its impact on the regional Contact Community.",
    "Text": "The California Contact Improvisation Jam at Harbin Hot Springs continues to be an amazing, delightful, challenging, evolving phenomenon. The first one was held in the Fall of 1986. We're now working on the eighth Jam, which will be the end of May, 1990. The organizers are: Julie Oak, Penny Paulus, David Russell, Robin Trenda, and myself. On occasion, due to uncontrollable circumstances or by choice, an individual organizer has taken a Jam \"off.\" For the past year, Robin has discontinued his role as an organizer, because of the vast commitment he has made to establishing and directing the new Wall Street Center for the Arts in Chico, CA. In the Spring of '86, the 5 of us, plus several other Bay Area Contactors were at the Breitenbush Jam [in Oregon]. Robin proposed a meeting for exploratory talks for anyone interested in starting a California jam. During the week we must have had 4 or 5 meetings and the groundwork I oz was laid. We went home, fresh from the excitement of Breitenbush, made phone calls, decided on Harbin as the site (mostly because of the spacious Conference Center, the mineral hot tubs and pools, and its 2Vi hour proximity to the Bay Area), found a caterer, chose a date and the ball was rolling. We had a solid example from Breitenbush to draw upon, and our own personal experiences there helped shape our ideas about how we wanted our jam to be. Thanks to Alito Alessi and Karen Nelson for creating the event that inspired us. We had the advantage of having a large regional Contact Community as a base, but still we decided to minimize our risk and start small. The first one was from Friday night ., to Sunday night, and was truly one §1 of the most joyous and exhilarating c3 weekends of my life. Everyone seemed to feel that way. It was like giving birth, except that the labor had seemed so easy! We decided not to wait a whole year to do it again. The 2nd Jam was about 6 months later, © 0 in May '87, and was expanded to 3 ] days and nights. c.. We've been doing them twice a year ever since, one in the Fall (late October, early November) and one in ~ the Spring (late April, early May). !:'-The 1990 schedule, however, has ·g, been changed drastically. The Con..: ference Center we use at Harbin c (where we have a beautiful large, iJ airy room, bathrooms, showers, a ~ small \"guru\" room, and hot & cool 15 pools all to ourselves) is in high de0' mand, and this year is not available tf at our usual dates. Also, for years ;; people have been wanting a longer E jam, and there is an ever-expanding ~ list of folks who want to come. We c. always have a waiting list, though ·5 we've increased our maximum from v B 40 to 55. So, we decided to try gf' something different. This year we're i having THREE Jams-all occurring over holiday weekends [see Notice in \"CQ Newsletter\"]. We will resume our \"regular\" Spring/Fall schedule Volume 15 1990 in '91. What has been the effect of all these Jams? Besides being a tremendous source of enjoyment and opportunity for exploration and development of our Contact, there has been much bonding and inspiration for other Contact activities. The \"Community\" I speak of has grown dramatically during these last four years. It is still diverse, and not everyone involved with Contact comes to the Jams. But a strong, vibrant and more organized group continues to spawn, expand, create and develop. The annual Contact Festival emerged from an initial vision and discussion at one Harbin Jam, spearheaded by Andrew Clibanoff, who now lives on the East Coast. The Contact Teachers Network has taken shape-we now cooperatively list all our classes, workshops, jams and performances together on one joint flyer. There was an energetic effort to create a Contact Community Center. Many people devoted much time and energy to this endeavor. Because of the lengthy process we were preempted in getting the studio we had hoped to rent. For now, the 8th Street Studio serves as our Berkeley hub. There have been various performance groups and series, as well as Contact camping trips and picnics. A 40-minute edited videotape titled \"Thank You For This Dance,\" has been created by videographer/filmmaker Brandy Brawner and me. It contains footage shot at the '87 and '88 Harbin Jams. Copies are available from me for $25 [see 'Contacts' for address]. Although the majority of Harbin J ammers do come from the Bay Area, many have come from throughout the West Coast, notably Seattle, Portland and San Diego. We strive to set up an environment where everyone feels welcomed, included; and that each person's feelings, ideas and feedback are important. We have daily group \"sits\" and meetings (though we prefer to call them \"gatherings\"). We have a \"dream pool\" where people put out their dreams and fantasies for things they would like to have happen at that Jam. There are group scores and presentations. A memorable one, initiated by Darshana [Ellis] from San Diego, involved nude women and paint. After much heated debate about whether, where and when it was going to happen, it turned out to be an exquisite dance ritual performed outside shortly before the Sunday closing. Last Fall, Keriac and others constructed a thoughtful score which we all participated in, processing our many deep and mixed feelings following the Earthquake (\"The Pretty Big One\") which we had just survived 1 Vi weeks before. There is careful attention given to group process and how Jam policies and decisions are made. Participants' written feedback at the end of each Jam has proven invaluable. As organizers, we have developed our skills as facilitators-a role which has proven to be both challenging and rewarding. And of course there's lots of Contact. Dancing, jamming, classes, more jamming. But I think what makes the experience so rich is that rather than being an isolated 2-hour episode of Contact (like at a weekly jam) it goes on 24 hours a day for 3 or 4 days. We live it and breathe it together, as a group. We eat together, sleep together (accommodations are either camping or communal in the conference center), hot tub together, hike, dance, talk, play, drum, argue, sing, cry, laugh, hug, etc. It feels so natural. I always feel somehow more fully \"me\" at these Jams than at practically any other time. And I always feel so grateful for this form which has so immeasurably enriched my life; and for the opportunity to serve, grow with, and be part of this special Community, which I know extends beyond the Bay Area, beyond California, beyond the U.S., even beyond Europe and into at least parts of the rest of the world. * SHARON TOMSKY is a dancer, contacter, and bodyworker.

    ],
    "Abstract": "Tom Giebink reflects on his experiences dancing with differently-abled individuals at a DanceAbility workshop, exploring themes of empathy, balance, and the transcendence of physical limitations. He shares anecdotes about dancing with individuals with cerebral palsy, blindness, and spinal cord injuries, highlighting the unique perspectives and abilities they bring to movement and improvisation.",
    "Text": "Empathy, an elusive word, means   dancing in another person's skin? If empathy is the ultimate form of love, then dancing contact improvisation, too, is a form of love. This idea took on new meaning for me in Eugene, Oregon at the 1991 DanceAbility workshop. Disability is not monolithic. Cerebral Palsy is not the same as Multiple Sclerosis is not the same as Paralysis due to nerve damage is not the same as Blindness. Even within the \"category\" of cerebral palsy, one person can communicate by speech, another by pointing at picture symbols, yet another spells words by looking through a clear plastic plate covered with the alphabet while a \"reader\" speaks the words the \"speaker's\" eye movements have indicated. Each person is affected by their disability in a singular way, yet they are routinely lumped together as people \"who can't get along without help\" in our (able-bodied) world. Instead, each has struck a different balance with the physical world, making themselves differently-abled. Gerry Overington, who is totally blind, told me that I might close my eyes but would still not enter the world he lives in since my \"mind's eye\" would still see the scene. He does not live in a picture that's been temporarily obscured. For him the balance of his senses has shifted toward attention to touch, sound, smell, and memory. Bruce Curtis lost the use of his legs, and hands partially, to his spinal cord injury at 17. Since then, his wheelchair has become an extension of his body. (He's definitely not \"confined\" by it.) If I say, \"Wheels have replaced his legs and feet,\" that seems obvious yet far too simple. 202 CQ/CJ Sourcebook Rather, his body has become differently shaped because it integrates his chair with his flesh and bones so that his movement is an ever-varying combination of the capabilities of both. In dancing with Bruce, I was the one learning to move. I couldn't respond in habitual ways-weight and balance were different. For instance, \"taking weight\" in an able-bodied duet often involves supporting the other's weight through spine, legs, and feet. However, in one duet with Bruce, I felt \"taking weight\" as a balancing in which our arms were like the spokes of a wheel transmitting weight back and forth between me as the hub, and him as the rim, our weights alternately stretched away then compressed towards each other. Bruce might lean/ extend into me in such a way that my weight, anchored through the floor, would provide a resistant center which he could alternately push off from or be pulled in by, creating a momentum and continuous change of direction that rolled his chair around me. Gravity seemed to act horizontally as he pivoted around me. No hands were required to turn the wheels of his chair, the spiraling thrust created was the almost effortless product of the lateral interplay of our weights. (The image of planets orbiting each other comes to mind.) Seen from the outside, one might think that the able-bodied person was always initiating, but Bruce said his partner's active weight supported him by providing a resistance he could work off of, amplifying his initial impulses so that his range of movement was extended. In fact, our dance was unrestrained by his chair whether he was moving in it or carrying the duet out of it to the floor. Emery Blackwell cannot walk or feed himself. When I helped him at the Breitenbush Jam my hands were momentarily his: when they fed him, while brushing his teeth, while cleaning up after being on the toilet. .. standing or sitting was a game of balance and support with me or some well-anchored object. Yet he bicycles 30-60 miles a day, alone. He talks of his dance of getting into and out of the bathtub, dancing his way out of bed, into the bathroom. He has a joy in moving that I realize I've long given up to the habitual shorthand of getting from here to there in the world. He also dances for audiences-solo, and in a remarkable partnership with Alito Alessi, continually dancing through what I'd imagined to be his limits. He bought ballet shoes for feet which, although they will not support his weight, have been poetically aligned by his cerebral palsy into a permanent en pointe position. He is a truly graceful, whole human. Dancing in EMPATHY, what does it mean? Bruce told me a story, saying, \"Suppose I drop a coin on the ground. Now, it usually takes me longer to pick it up than an able-bodied person and it's curious to see if someone will pick it up before I do. There is a certain amount of time which society allots to a given task and if I take longer than that I am seen to be having a problem.\" He's not. Long ago he accepted his own frame of reference. Time has become very personal. He's not having any trouble but able-bodied people often don't see that. Their discomfort sets in when, \"it takes him too long\" and sympathetically, sometimes with pity, the coin is picked up so that he doesn't have to \"work so hard at it.\" Bruce said he does appreciate help, but it almost always comes with that attendant insistence on the able-bodied frame of reference. Sometimes that means he's been judged, subconsciously or not, to be less than competent. Perhaps he's seen to be in physical pain? For a short while I was captive of those feelings, even when I knew they had no basis in fact. In my case, the pain and fear associated with old, and temporarily-very-disabling skiing injuries were being dredged up, leading to momentary irrationalities like, \"He is in pain, and unhappy. It's temporary, he'll heal   \" Or, sometimes emotions can link disabilities with aging and dying (I've had a close friend and parent die recently) and so sadness and grief, as well as fears around the loss of physical functioning, can inappropriately become attached to disabled people. It's awkward when Volume16 1991 photo: Rochus Schmuecker Gerry Overington getting a ride with Emery Blackwell in Eugene, Oregon. the experience of the differently-abled is felt through an able-bodied filter, but it's not surprising. We spend so much time and attention dancing around our own discomfort. So to dance in empathy is to dance in the frame of reference of one's differently-abled partner, moving on equal terms   which is true of contact improvisation in general but now one stretches into new territory (as Chinese or Arabic are a much greater stretch for our English ears and tongues than German or Spanish). Sometimes the contact of the improvisation is other than touch. Other times conflicting touch impulses are felt. Emery told me that an able-bodied person bends an arm by signalling muscles to contract while simultaneously suppressing those signals to muscles opposing that movement, but the area of his brain which controls the \"suppression\" function has been damaged by cerebral palsy so both bending and straightening muscles contract at the same time. It's a standoff that he can overcome by conscious thought but there's often a \"lag time\" of 30 seconds or more which, even then, is accompanied by the jerkiness of conflicting muscle messages. In dancing Volume 16 1991 with him, I found I had a tendency to arbitrarily choose to follow one impulse or, conversely, none. Either way, I was stuck in my own perspective, doing my own dance, drowning out Emery's initiatives. Waiting with Emery meant operating in his time, listening for his intention to sift through his nervous system, allowing my senses to shift into line with his without losing my own center. Dancing with that lack of knowing was differently-dancing, since for those dances I was living as if all muscle movements required conscious intervention. I felt the awkwardness like a never-ending struggle to juggle. Rarely have I been so conscious of the body as the container of the spirit. But then that's the content of these dances: the movement of the human spirit transcending the container it's been given by birth or chance. In contact improvisation, both movers are extending through limits, not the least of which are the limits of empathy   going into another world and allowing another into one's own. Enabling each other to dance with those risks. * TOM GIEBINK works as a sculptor, painter, performer, and video artist in Austin, Texas where he is currently organizing a DanceAbi/ity workshop with Mary Ganzon to take place hopefully this coming fall.

    "Abstract": "John William Johnson questions the criteria for deciding to perform at the Breitenbush Jam, and whether performers have a responsibility to give their best to the audience.

    "Text": "Some questions I brought to the performance portion [of the Breitenbush Jam experience in Oregon, specifically the post-Jam performances in Eugene] were never addressed and are still burning a groove in my brain. What is the criteria for deciding to perform, and do we have a responsibility to the audience to give our best? I was very happy to see that everyone who wanted to got to perform. There was no sense of elitism, or judging a person's worthiness to perform. But I think it would serve us all to help each other bring what is unique and special about us to the stage. At 44, I think of myself more as a mover than a dancer. 'Performance artist' is a convenient term nowadays. I think of a dancer as someone who spends a lot of time dancing, practicing, focussing on their body as an instrument of expression. As a performer, I try to focus on the areas in which I can offer something unique, something that makes a contribution. For people with limited dance training and limited contact experience to perform in either of these areas doesn't seem to make sense, for sure to the audience, and probably not for the performers. My wife, who has a strong ballet background, found it hard to relate to most of the performances. She was reminded of when she was a little girl, and the kids on the block would put skits together, and the parents would watch. I guess this is fine, if the audience feels related enough to the performer that they really don't care what they do; they just love seeing their friends on stage. What is the criteria for deciding to perform, and do we have a responsibility to the audience to give our best? Scheduling only one day [at the end of the Breitenbush Jam] for a Performance Conference seems an anomaly to me. I think it would make more sense to have the jam on the weekend, and have the conference last much longer. There was barely enough time to figure out what we wanted to do, and there was little if any time to take advantage of the people present who spend their lives as performers. The range of commitment to performing varied greatly. Should anyone be allowed to come to the Performance Conference? It was nice to feel like we were all kindred spirits, but the day seemed identical to me to many improvisational workshops that are offered to the general public. I missed being able to pick the brains of Steve [Paxton] and Nancy [Stark Smith] and Alito [Alessi] and Karen [Nelson]. It would be interesting to know why we all came to the Performance Conference. I have the sense that it's partially an ego thing. I get to go home and say I'm a performer, I get to make believe I'm of the same caliber as people who focus their lives on performing. I get to avoid all the deeper questions, all the demons that squelch my creative drive the other 51 weeks of the year. Namaste, John William Johnson Portland, Oregon"

She discusses the therapeutic effect of Contact Improvisation and the need to restore the possibility of communicating through touch in childhood.",
    "Text": "It has been said that gravity is the expression of Mother Earth's love for her children. When I imagine that hug ending, I feel the horror of being lost in space, alone. When my baby had the hiccups inside me, I yearned to comfort her, but how could I hold in my arms what I already held in my womb? My blood in her veins, my body her world-yet I could not say to her, \"I am here. You are not alone.\" That which loves us surrounds us yet cannot contact us; we must contact it. Perha~s I could say that culture is the collected effort of our species to ·;nake contact with the unseeable totality in which we are developing. It can not pick us up when we cry. But its blood runs in our veins. Sometimes, in dreams, we see what we later will call a face. I find it tragic that Contact Improvisation has so often a therapeutic effect on a person. That implies that everyone out there who isn't experiencing it is probably suffering. That doesn't sound quite logical. But surely it has spread because it answered a collective need, quenched a collective thirst. I have tasted my own milk and it is sweet. I cannot remember, but I imagine, that as a breast-sucking newborn, I enjoyed nursing not only Volume 16 1991 for the sweet sustenance it poured into me like sunshine, but equally for the contact improvisation. We could call it our first conversational partner, speaking and listening through the skin of mouth, hands, arms, face and chest, to a partner who is warm, responsive, fluid, round and featuring a special point of access. The circle with the point in the center. Symbol of the sun, the mother. (In Tibetan teachings, the solar principle is feminine-the power to ripen and sustain life-and the lunar principle is masculine. It was affirming to see this interpretation.) What effect has it had on us to live in a society in which our most important symbol has been deemed obscene? I am not advocating a \"topless\" society, though I see nothing wrong with that concept, so long as it is left up to each individual to decide. But I believe in doing the obvious, ·or at least recognizing it, and it is obvious that the human body is a long way yet from being liberated. Especially the body of the mother, once worshipped, now persecuted through taboos, harsh birth practices, a medical establishment that discourages nursing, and ignores the fact that skin-toskin contact with the baby is the key to its well-being and development. In accepting the Nobel Prize, and again in addressing the Italian Government this spring, His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet reminded his audience that every member of photos by Janet L. Cox the human race is born free of religion or culture, but shares universally with all human babies the need for affection. Physical contact with the mother is the single most important factor in the well-being of the newborn for the first weeks of life, he said. It reaffirmed my feeling that this is the topic of the hour. If we allow the generation being born now to grow up with their need for contact satisfied instead of scorned, the problems of the world may be inherited by sane and compassionate people who have the natural ability to do the obvious. I wonder how the contact community can assist in the process of restoring to childhood the possibility of communicating with parents or others through touch-a language already functioning at birth, years before speech is perfected. Perhaps the goal of Contact Improvisation should be to render itself obsolete. My hope is to stimulate dialogue in \"Still Moving\" regarding the language of touch between parent and infant. I would like to hear accounts of what you've been doing privately and/ or publicly with this relationship. * CHRISTINA SV ANE was one of the founders of Movement Research, Inc. in NYC.

    "Text": "Tumbling socks   That is what the performance of Continuing Contact brought to mind during the concert. The eight dancers appeared in loose white costumes and took turns bumping each other out of duets. Have you ever sat and watched your clean clothes rise and fall through the spin of the drying cycle? A pair of white socks thrown into a dark load will stand out vividly and will look like they are tumbling alone in the dark. I can easily unf ocus my eyes from the looping pattern and concentrate on the intimate movement of socks in contact with each other. The socks wrap, roll and slide across each other. Theirs is a continuous falling and rising. There is no \"muscling it\" in this duet, the socks rise in response to their incredible momentum. The dancers on stage also did a duet of wrapping, falling, sliding, rising. There was continuous motion; none of the moments of contact resulted in weight colliding and ending in dead stops. Nothing ever remains stationary in the dryer either. Kim Monis When the dancing began I was absorbed in the details; where the point of contact was, where it was traveling and how; placement of weight. Soon, I felt m)'self responding in, as they call it, a kinesthetic way, feeling physical empathy with the movement. Yet I, for the first time so removed from the dancers, was deeply moved by the spontaneity of their responses to each other; the infinite variety, and the incredible (and necessary) sensitivity of those responses. I had not been separated enough from it before to see the miraculousness of these movements in terms of just daily human interaction. SylviaChwe Watching Contact and doing Contact are experiences further apart than most audience/performer relationships. Contact is like Pop Rocks. If you just watch surface activity, it's difficult to understand what's going on. Get Close, pay attention; maybe you'll hear it crackle. But to really experience it, you've got to pop it in your mouth and feel the explosions. Betsy Cutler -0 Qj l c: ..c: ..2. @ 0 0 ..c: c. \"Continuing Contact\" was a performance Ann Cooper Albright directed with her students at Oberlin College, Spring 1990. Using contact improvisation, it was danced on a proscenium stage in front of a backdrop of enlarged 'hieroglyphs'. The performance frame in which contact improvisation was danced in the ODC concert trivialized this movement form. On a proscenium stage, the Continuing Contact dancers were formally separated from the audience, removing the personability and the three-dimensionality available at closer viewing. Unlike a regular jam, the dancers wore white costumes which made it difficult to distinguish between bodies and hence watch the particulars of what one body was doing, save dancing solo, at any particular time   The audience found the dancing amusing if not hilarious and I became increasingly more uncomfortable as the people around me laughed harder. What for me is a beautiful and moving dance form had become a comedy act. Chloe Stamas"

    "Abstract": "Barry Kirsh reflects on his journey with Contact Improvisation, contrasting it with his father's bowling and exploring the spiritual and physical aspects of the dance form. He discusses his initial focus on technique, his shift towards listening to impulses, and the challenges of integrating his dance aspirations with his daily life.",
    "Text": "Would you pass up free tickets to an ice hockey game at the Forum in Montreal? Seats at ice level, with the Canadiens playing the defending Stanley Cup Champion Calgary Flames? I did. And my father was baffled when I declined his invitation. I'm sure he was shaking his head at the other end of the telephone line and wondering about me. Don't misunderstand. I love hockey. But, on Wednesday nights this autumn, I have been attending dance classes. In fact I have been dancing Contact Improvisation on a once weekly basis for the better part of 4 years now. My father, on the other hand, has been bowling every Tuesday night for the last 40 years. Yet, he would grab the hockey tickets at a moment's notice. Why didn't I? Could it be that 'the World of Dance' has occasioned more for me than bowling has for my father? Three and four years ago I remember that the dancers talked a lot about technique. Many of us in Contact courses and occasional weekerid workshops wanted to improve our skills. I felt that if I could stand on my hands and flip over someone else's back, then I would improve tremendously as a Contact Dancer. Or at least be in a position to register for a new course entitled, \"Flying,\" an eventual step from Contaet Dance, I believed. Luckily Montreal is the home of several fine Contact Dance teachers. Andrew Harwood, the leader in three workshops I have attended, has helped me. My feeble attempts to walk on my hands were not ridiculed. Instead, my immediate needs were recognized. He suggested poetic polarities to frame my precarious perches. We pulled for the earth and pushed to the sky. We differentiated shadows amidst images of light/dark. With weight/lightness, we intimated the profundity of Being and Nothingness it seemed, as I grew into my body more fully. The poetry did assuage my fears of disorientation. Though I still had to accept the reality of lurching acrobatic postures and an instinctual begging for form. I kept on. Contact Dance became a paradox to me. It intrigued me as a mystical endeavour in the guise of physical movement. It was exciting that people around me seemed uninhibited about their bodies. So spiritual communication through bodily movement became the enigma I sought to express each time I danced. To hell with handstands! If I could listen to the impulse, the magic of Contact might glow in the intense corporeal kinship on the dance floor. It was better than erotic behavior because it drew from many more human emotions. And I took delight in it. My weekly course work with Gurney Bolster confirmed the notion that concentration was essential. The long warm-ups, from the slightest movement, gradually, into the sweeping gestures of the entire body, heating up and perspiring in solo dance focussed my energy and prepared me best to dance with others. I think I wanted to become a monk at one point. Cultivating the meditative poise of a monk would surely accrue the release of unfettered movement. Then I went home to my wife and kids to realize that deliberate action often meant compromise. No recluse could I be. Nevertheless, I wished to continue my labour of love, regardless of my certain limitations. But Gurney became pregnant, and Andrew, like most of the Contact teachers, taught exclusively during the day. Spiritual aspirations could not transcend the realities of my daily life. I was a layman whose feet coul"

Tica Lemos reflects on Diane Elliot's article about creating safe contact environments and shares her experiences teaching contact improvisation in Brazil.",
    "Text": "It was in April '86 when I first saw contact improvisation. Nancy Stark Smith and Lou Danielson Stewart were giving a demo [in Austin, Texas] on the Friday evening before a weekend workshop with Nancy. I had an immediate kinesthetic response and a sensation of calling. I knew that my body/mind was curious and longed to explored this form. It wasn't until the latter part of '87 that this practice was part of my life. I was truly in love with it and was a little incredulous when some would say, \"I tried it, but it's not for me,\" or, \"I have a really hard time watching it.\" I knew I hadn't been exposed to another side of how people have experienced contact. Then, in a group conversation at the dorm during the A Cappella workshop '89, someone brought up how people had left the form-for reasons other than family, other movement forms, or some seemingly natural reason. This piqued my curiosity. My attention at people's grievances during round robins, jams, or workshops heightened, not because I wanted to fix anything but I just wanted to know. So, I have really appreciated Martin Keogh's and Kirk Andrews' \"What's in the Bag: Issues that lie in the shadow of contact improvisation,'' (\"Still Moving,\" CQ Vol. 15:1, Winter 90) and Mark Pritchard's \"My Rise and Fall in Contact Improv\" (CQ Vol. 15:3, Fall 90). They have really broadened my vocabulary of perception, understanding, and allowance. I am realistic enough to know that uncriticized consensus is a sign of narrow vision and listening, not to mention impending blocks. Thank you everybody for the contributions to \"Still Moving\"-for the ones with continuing communities and for those building ones. There seems to be a common thread to bridge and breach a loneliness. I am happy to report on our own contact group. We had our first all-day jam this summer. [See \"Newsletter\" for report.] Mary Ganzon Austin, Texas I would like to comment about Diane Elliot's article in the \"Still Moving\" section-\"Making Safe Contact\" /CQ Vol. 15:2, Spring/Summer 90]. I was moved by her capacity to put down the ongoing difficulties, reflections, situations, conclusions, etc. of the work. That was great, because just recently in a workshop in May [in Sao Paulo, Brasil) I felt good about teaching, I mean in an ordering way, a kind of organizing in my mind together with people's time or timing how to introduce contact and all of its interaction with energy, physics, dance .. , but it's still so fragile that I'm not able to reflect clearly, or even get at any conclusion. It's like a necessary step of the work and I'm in a very good humour to at least recognize a subtle change and understanding of my teaching. Let's see: people here have never seen the work of contact; to feel better when putting together a small woman with a big man or to allow the men to be together at another time or to let them choose by themselves; to work only on the floor for a few minutes or few days, why?   It's more intuition than knowing. Well! Let's say it's not so complicated, but on the other hand, it is, otherwise I can't know where I am, and it's hard for students to get somewhere. I also feel that you have to teach & practice a few movement skills just like any language so you have a minimum to be able to work with and to allow the dance & principles to come out and to develop by themselves. I think Elliot's right when she says that the great thing is to create an atmosphere for the work, (but at the same time not to feel responsible or guilty if things work or not), but to create an atmosphere I need to be calm. It means that I can be lost, but if I'm not calm in my heart and mind it's not easy. It's about having love, to be in love and with love, but love is not enough if I'm not clear about what I want to do, to give, to receive, to look for or NOT. The way that she used to get her experiences down on paper helped me a lot. I've also appreciated her openness and courage to put out and share with people her fears and angers.

Madison, Wisconsin: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1990. 114 North Murray Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53715. Sharing the Dance, by Cynthia J. Novack, is subtitled Contact Improvisation and American Culture. She has posed her deep investigation of contact improvisation as a lens through which she shapes her view of American culture from 1960 onward. She holds that we can have a perspective on what we do in contact improvisation by contrasting it with other political and dance phenomena from the period, and by measuring contact history with cycles of other cultural events which are familiar to usthe \"demise\" of the 1960s counterculture, the effect of an affluent economy turning meager, the flings of youth leading to more measured steps. Cynthia J. Novack is an anthropologist, dancer/choreographer and teacher. With striking intelligence and patience, she writes from all these perspectives in this book. To save you any inconvenience, I quote the blurb on the back cover of the book: \"   The book examines the ways in which contact improvisers (and their surrounding communities) encoded sexuality, spontaneity, and gender roles, as well as concepts of the self and society in their dancing. While focusing on the changing pr_actice of contact improvisation through two decades of social transformation, Novack's work incorporates the history of rock dancing and disco, the modern and experimental dance movements of Merce Cunningham, Anna Halprin, and Judson Church, among others, and a variety of other physical activities, such as martial arts, aerobics, and ~rest ling. \"Novack concludes her study with a discussion of contact improvisation both as an icon of the \"end of the sixties\" and as an ongoing dance practice which continues to demonstrate the subtle ways in which movement represents and creates culture.\" Steve Paxton"

    "Text": "When this form is taken to the floor the energy of the extreme twist of the body promotes a coil which can be rolled with no apparent effort. This is done with the spiral initiated either at the top with the hands and arms, or with the toes, feet, and legs at the bottom. In these spiral rolls, a single initiation of energy flows into the most extreme spiral the body can achieve and the roll continues as long as the shape is maintained. The movement stems from changes of weight inside the body as different surfaces of the spirals are rolled upon. The less extreme alternating helixes of walking also permit movement initiation from different places in the body, but in practice just a few such options are integrated into an habitual walk. The other options wither with disuse. Turning this basic form onto its side causes many parts of the body to extend and take responsibility for the roll."

    "Text": "Crescent rolls come in 5 varieties. The premise: a body shaped like a banana, arced from top to toe, and maintaining this exterior shape relative to gravity while rolling along the floor. In this form the left and right sides of the body stay closer to parallel than in the previous spiral form. The rolling choices are: head lifted, head and feet lifted, middle lifted. And two in which the whole body is stretched along the floor: rolling toward the points of the arc or toward the bend of it. These rolls are viewed as a set because of their external form; the coordinations for their execution are different as the relationship of the shape to gravity changes. The first roll provides a good stretching for the short muscles at the joining of the sides of the pelvis to the upper torso, and a good stretch for the abdominals. The arms are used on the floor, so great strength is not needed in the lower back. The second and third rolls are outstanding whole-body toners, and are fairly advanced work, muscularly. The last two were spotted in the dance works of Simone Forti, the American choreographer, and don't require as much strength, but provide one of the unusual coordination problems in the annals of human locomotion. If coming forward, the roll is toward the points. If moving backward, toward the bend."

    "Abstract": "This article discusses the benefits of exploring form through nine different rolls, emphasizing the unusual sensations and spinal workout they provide. It also highlights the importance of touch in teaching these rolls, particularly for blind individuals, and how they can guide sighted individuals through kinesthetic understanding.",
    "Text": "This article is excerpted from a forthcoming writing by Touchdown Dance, a project working for extended mobility for the blind, directed by Steve Paxton and Ann Kilcoyne, Devon, England. Exploring form in these nine rolls has several advantages. Fear of falling does not interfere with learning. The sensations found in the exercise are unusual: we rarely notice these singular forms in our daily movement, but in these rolls we can hardly miss the basic forms-the helix and the turning crescent. These forms give the spine itself a workout, as well as the muscles and attachments of the spine. The point is that there are sensations in the body of the spine itself, in the discs. This rather dull lot of feelings along the length of the spine can best be identified in the lumbar, where a vague pinching sensation may accompany the backbend. Once the quality of sensation in the spine is found, it can be noticed in the course of the rolls. It then begins to make new sense to speak of 'the spine'. A prerequisite to this discovery is relaxation, as tension masks sensation and maintaining it requires wasted effort. Once the feeling in the spine has been located, one can more accurately stretch the circling arms through the upper spine at the center of the back, or align points on the spine to discover new postures. Sighted people start to learn these rolls by seeing them. For those having difficulty in translating what they've seen into what to do, handson is most useful, with verbal aids. Blind people I work with learn the rolls by feeling with their hands and are further assisted by hands-on and verbal aids. When the blind then direct the efforts of the sighted, they tend to teach by hand. They convey the principles, and the sighted person can visualize what is meant. In teaching, one can transmit the basic spiral forms visually, verbally, and kinesthetically. Each of these transmissions is effective, but touch is the keystone of the work. *"

    "Abstract": "Judy Stone describes her experience teaching contact improvisation at Giant Steps, a school for children with neuro-integrative dysfunction. She details the innovative approach of the school, the techniques used to establish rapport with students, and the positive learning experiences that resulted from introducing the children to contact improvisation.",
    "Text": "From September 1989 until June 1990, I taught contact improvisation at Giant Steps, the Canadian Institute for Neuro-lntegrative Development. This Montreal school is known throughout North America for its innovative approach. The director, Darlene Beringer, is open to many new ideas and was daring enough to include contact dance as part of the school curriculum. To this end, Ms. Beringer assembled a team of three experienced contact dancers: Ian Talbot, who had been working at the school for several years, Marie-Renee Tremblay, and myself, Judy Stone. In December, Ian was obligated to leave because of other commitments, and he was replaced by Fiona Meyer. Giant Steps services children between the ages of 4 and 13 with developmental delay, sensory and motor dysfunction, aphasia, autism, apraxia, genetic disorders and specific syndromes. Techniques of synchronization and neuro-integrative patterning used in music therapy and occupational therapy form the basis of the school's approach. Ms. Beringer recognized that contact improvisation uses both vestibular movement patterns and proprioception within an improvised context that is readily adaptable to individual needs and abilities. We began by establishing a rapport with our students using massage, manipulation and simple weight exchanges. For the first few weeks we paired each child with an adult As the months passed and comfort levels increased, the children worked with each other more and more. Our sessions were structured much like an adult's contact class with a warm-up followed by directed exercises around a theme (falling, rolling, supporting weight, following a point of contact), then dancing (duets, round robins, solos), and ending with a warm down. Sixty children came to us in groups numbering from three to nine. Each group had very different abilities and we adapted the classes accordingly. Two adults would demonstrate an exercise while the children watched. Some were aided by our simultaneous verbal descriptions while others could imitate our actions without necessarily understanding our words. Levels of verbal and physical prompting that were necessary also varied immensely. There were enthusiastic students who quickly took the exercises and made them into their own dances with intriguing variations. Even the children who needed to be guided through each step appeared to enjoy the new movement sensations. Many children responded to concrete imagery. We gave names and a little story to each exercise (see examples). When we began to have round robins, children would at times lose focus and we would use the names of exercises as anchors to recall their attention to the dance. \"Look at Emilie, she's being a rock. How can you dance with that rock?\" \"It looks like Francois is being a house. Can you be a snake and slither through his house?\" These movement suggestions helped to overcome the impasses of short attention spans, motivational lapses or perceptual disorganization. Everyone involved in our dance program was surprised and delighted by the progress which the students made. Children who were initially quite tactilephobic began to relish the physical contact that they received in our class. Passive or withdrawn children were soon initiating contact and by the end of the year joyous dances filled with mutual respect and recognition developed between children who had previously shown little interest in each other. I myself was amazed at the wide variety of positive learning experiences that came about through introducing the children to contact improvisation. This dance form has been an incredibly effective tool in reaching these sometimes unreachable children. A SAMPLE OF EXERCIS~ THE ROCK One child would be the support, or \"rock,\" on hands and knees. Her partner would find various ways to give weight. We would offer suggestions such as: sitting or lying on the rock; sliding off the rock; being snow melting on the rock; finding various ways to be on or near the rock as it moved about the room; finding ways to be supported by two rocks; somersaulting from a rock then crawling underneath your partner to become the support for her. Exercises would usually be introduced with an adult partner, the adult in this case being first the rock, then the weight giver. When the children became comforta.ble giving and taking weight they would then work with each other. Judy Stone with students at Giant Steps. 218 CQ/CI Sourcebook Volume17 1992 FOOT DANCE BRIDGES WITH SNAKES We did dances with different body parts. Foot dances were a favorite that children at any level could do. Snakes would slither under a roomful of wavering bridges. THE RAIN MASSAGE Fingers and loose fists were gentle raindrops falling on the backs of children resting on the floor. The teachers in the school who gave so much to the children were pleasantly surprised to be receiving relaxing massages from their charges. The children also enjoyed massaging each other. THE CHAIR One child lies on their back, knees over chest, feet up, forming a chair which gently pushes into the air anyone daring enough to sit upon it. Variations: leaning against the chair with different body parts. This exercise brought smiles to the often impassive faces of severely autistic children. THE MONKEY IN THE TREE A monkey climbs a human tree in search of imaginary bananas. Many earthbound children were motivated to climb to unexpected heights. THE HOUSE Several children join together forming a multi-level structure. Others take tums entering, exiting and otherwise exploring the house.* If you have any questions or would like to share your work with us please write or call: Judy Stone, 4039 Des Erables, Montreal, PQ, H2K 3V7, Canada; (514) 524-0280."

    "Abstract": "Lauren Shapiro Raker discusses her experience using contact improvisation with young children to enhance their modes of expression. She describes the evolution of \"Pretzel\" dances with specific rules and the use of a basic notation method to guide the children's movements. The project culminates in the children creating their own music to accompany their dances.",
    "Text": "Improvisation is the most natural form of movement for the young child who is beginning to dance. They move freely through suggestions of various images   readily becoming the \"butterfly,\" \"cloud,\" or \"tiger\" that is suggested. Throughout my twenty years of teaching experience with young children, I have employed improvisation as a method to enhance the children's modes of expression. Although they occasionally made contact with another student (partner) during the course of an exercise, it often seemed uncomfortable, or took on the appearance of social dance styles. The movement then became more contrived and less free. Five years ago, I began to introduce contact improvisation to the children. We began gradually with very specific rules. What evolved were some very elaborate and interesting shapes, which we dubbed \"Pretzel\" dances. The children loved the procedure as well as the results. We have continued to evolve these dances over the years by adding and eliminating the rules of design. In the most basic form, a group of youngsters takes independent space on the floor. They must be close enough to the other students to touch them. Upon hearing certain musical cues, i.e., the beat of a drum, they must contact a neighbor with any one part of their body. Upon hearing the second cue, they make contact with another child or the original child using a differen' part of their body. This method continues until the children are entwined in an elaborate design. The design usually breaks apart with a final musical cue (i.e., the ping of a triangle), and then the group is ready to begin a new design. Very often when I watch their pieces evolve, it seems that I am viewing them through a giant kaleidoscope. Recently we attempted a new version of our contact \"game.\" I decided to explore the use of a basic notation method. A pattern might be written like this: START: 1, 2, 3,   1, 4, 3,   2, 0, 2, END. These numbers indicated how many parts of their bodies should make contact with another dancer or dancers. By writing this series of numbers on the wall, the children viewed them as they moved. The contacts flowed more smoothly, and the transitions occurred at the individual pace of each child. They no longer only made contact at the specific beat of a drum. The results were less entangled and intertwined, but far more interesting and sophisticated. The final step of these contact projects at this point, has been to add our own music. Using simple percussion instruments, the children take turns being the musicians and the dancers. Although there seems to be a rigid formality to the method, it appears to have captured even the most reluctant and inhibited of the children to participate in the creation of joyful and creative design.* Students in Contact Project at Town School, NYC.

They describe the physical and emotional challenges faced by blind individuals and how contact improvisation can help them overcome these challenges. The article includes a case study of a blind man named Peter who found a new level of experience through contact improvisation.",
    "Text": "Peter is big and burly and in his fifties. He has virtually no sight. having been badly injured in a traffic accident His sight loss was instantaneous and irreversible. He could no longer work at his trade; he no longer had an income and he felt very depressed He came to the contact improvisation workshop with some trepidation-he was not \"artsy craftsy\" and thought dancers were a peculiar and probably effeminate breed However, he thought he would give it a chance as a friend of his had spoken very warmly about the workshop. Having been athletic and interested in sports when he was sighted, he experienced no difficulty with the work. Over the five days, he began to enjoy himself, giving and receiving massage and learning to build up the skills that are basic to contact improvisation. Towards the end of the workshop Peter was asked to contribute to some video-based research. At the start of the workshop, blind participants had been recorded walking the length of a gymnasium, finding a chair, sitting on it. and rising from it They were asked to go through the same exercise at the end of the workshop; thus we are able to record objective changes in posture and gait Peter had in fact missed the initial session as he had joined the workshop late. He is a very humorous man, and realising the reasons behind the exercise he treated us to his version of a \"bad walk\" as he put it What he gave was a hilarious Chaplinesque performance of the exercise: holding his cane ahead of him, he stumbled his way forward through the vast dark territory of the unseen gym, the blind cane then became a fencing sword and he fought his way through a duel with an imaginary foe. Victorious, his stick transformed into a horse which he sat astride and whipped into a gallop to the far end of the gym. Turning, he lurched drunkenly back towards the chair which he could not see but sensed the position of. Having reached it. he failed to sit on it. somersaulting his way through falls; and ultimately, threading his cane through the Volume 17 1992 back of the chair and hoisting i~ aloft over his shoulders, he trudged off into the proverbial sunset. Peter had found improvisation and performance. When the workshop finished Peter broke down and wept with deep grief. It was the first time since his accident, several years before, that he had cried. His tears were not only for his loss of sight but also tears of appreciation at having found a new level of experience. This experience opened up the future for him. He has since entered the Royal National College, in Hereford, England and qualified to become a masseur. He has found direction and now expects to combine his new-found skills in massage with his old interests in sports and sports injuries. Peter is one of many blind people who have come to contact improvisation workshops that we have developed in England over the last five years. These workshops are designed to extend the movement vocabulary and creative experience of the visually challenged and the professionals that work with them. The blind who have danced with us come from all walks of life. Some have been blind from birth, others have lost their sight in adulthood through degenerative diseases, accidents and diabetes. The professionals include social workers, recreation officers, teachers and dancers who work to make dance accessible to disabled people; most of the professionals are sighted but a few of them are visually impaired. If you are born without sight there are profound implications for your physical development as well as your social and intellectual/cultural life. The blind person is inhibited from freely moving from one place to another by the fear of falling over or bumping into things and by a confusion in spatial orientation. Those who are congenitally blind spend much of their lives at home, sitting or lying down. The paucity of the everyday movements of walking, sitting down and getting up means that the muscles in their feet and legs do not develop their potential. Through lack of use, their muscles are underdeveloped, flaccid and poorly toned. These characteristics are also reflected in posture; the torso is often limp, the head hanging forward. The essential movement needs of the body are often met by a gently repetitive rocking motion in the seated Volume 17 1992 position. This rocking is generally discouraged by family and professionals as it is considered to be a 'blindism '-i.e., a movement or gesture which is not found in the sighted world and which is seen as a stigma. In those people who have seen for some years but lost their sight in adult life there is another set of bodily responses. These people do not generally exhibit blindisms. Their gestural vocabulary is consonant with that of the dominant sighted culture, but their loss of sight prohibits normal everyday movement. The trauma and anxiety which accompanies visual loss is reflected in a chronic level of muscular tension which is so habitual as to make muscular relaxation a forgotten experience. they, too, stand and wait for someone with sight to guide them to another seat in another room where they can safely 'park' their bodies. Although there are some programmes of physical education available to the blind these are mostly purely functional and often mechanised. For example, there is tandem cycling, or jogging a course that is marked out by a rope which the blind person can hold onto, or the treadmill or weight lifting machines that are available in a modern gym. Whilst a few of the visually impaired make great efforts to keep themselves in trim by going to the gym, they generally report a sense of boredom with the repetitive and socially isolated nature of many of the exercise regimes open to them. Contact improvisation seemed an ideal activity for the blind, based as it is in the ·natural physics of movement, in human communication, and focused on a touch-based learning path rather than a 'seeing and copying' mode endemic in so many dance classes. The inherently democratic nature of contact improvisation makes it a particularly good form for the so-called disabled who deal continuously with disabling social attitudes and relationships. For example, Janee, who is partially sighted, had left the workshop with Rose, a sighted arts worker. They were sitting in a car at a petrol station when Rose was approached by a lady who Anne traces the pathway on Peter, from sacrum, under shoulders, underneath arms to the little linger. Sitting allows one to feel the sitzbones. Carollne (l.), is · extending ring and small lingers, feeling the connection from center-of-weight (pelvis) along the same path. Peter's hands don't grasp the thought of extension here. CQICI Sourcebook .2Zl"

    "Text": "Dear Anne, I will try to be articulate about my perceptions of the Contact Dance workshop I attended in the spring, though I don't consider putting thoughts into words to be my natural way of expressing myself. The workshop seems to have had quite a profound effect on me, and perhaps you will forgive me for starting by describing some of its after-effects. For a few days I felt quite out of tune with friends and acquaintances. I just wanted to withdraw and relive the experience, and one of the first things I did was to get out my sketch pad and draw a complete sequence of all the movements and partnerships I learned in the workshop; I found that I had remembered every single one vividly. When I got to bed, at peace and very relaxed, I had two strange experiences, which I suppose were sort of dreams. I was aware that I was lying inert in the dark. I began to feel as though my head was being gently drawn away from my body; as though some kind of magnetic force was attracting me, and the pull came first from one direction and then another. The sensation was similar to that which we did during the head massage exercise and I felt very elated, but was aware that the force controlling this sensation was not human. I wasn't afraid at this point, and the sensation then faded and the sequence changed. I was aware of standing in a bare room with white walls. I was only conscious of my body from the waist up. While standing in the same spot my body started to make a circular movement from the waist. As I did this I began to get the same feeling as before; that a magnetic force was drawing me upwards by the head. I felt myself rising upwards gaining speed and I could see the ceiling getting closer. I remember feeling slightly afraid at this point because I wasn't quite in control and I thought I might hit the ceiling, but I didn't, and just floated round and round the edges of the room as though on the end of a 222 CQ/CJ Sourcebook piece of elastic, til the intensity of the sensation woke me up. This experience was all the more unusual for me because I am not religious; haven't done any form of meditation; hadn't had any alcohol and wasn't high on anything. It's only happened on that one occasion so far and I would like to find out if other people who've done the workshops have had any kind of after-effects like this? There may be a connection between this experience and a discovery I made some years ago while undergoing some formal mobility training with the long cane, under blindfold. Much to my instructor's bewilderment, I found that I could sense objects from between 25 to 50 yards away without making contact with the long cane. I did this without sight or sound cues. I just felt a strong sense of claustrophobia when there were solid objects in front of me, and relief and elation when there were wide open spaces. Since my mobility instructor's objective was to teach me to detect obstacles with the cane, he was rather skeptical of this ability, and set me many challenges. He hadn't encountered this in other clients, but did reveal that a similar thing was referred to as a rare phenomenon in his profession, and was known as \"Shadow Sound.\" I disagree with this description: I don't think it is a \"rare phenomenon\" ; nor has it got anything to do with \"sound.\" I think it has more to do with a primitive instinct for self-preservation and dealing with the unknown, which is dormant in most people, and only comes into play when they are deprived of one of the other senses. Anyway, I return to my observations about the workshop. An element of the workshop that appealed to me was that the only \"props\" we needed were human partnerships. Through the variety of exercises and partnerships I was involved in during the workshop, I was able to initiate more ambitious shapes and movements, confident that I would get the support to carry them through as well as anticipating and supporting my partner's intentions. I think the basic structure of the workshop was sound, and there were only two instances where I experienced difficulty; though both of these were resolved during the five day period. The first was trying to respond, from the perspective of a person with visual impairment, to the mainly sighted imagery used to describe some of the shapes we were attempting to create, e.g., I didn't understand Steve's reference to \"a double helix,\" which we were supposed to achieve when we were doing the rolling exercise. As I suggested at the time, verbal description is necessary, but could be more effective if it referred to familiar tangible objects. (I have since found that I have a sea shell which is eroded by the sand, and forms the exact shape I was trying to make.) I think this point is important as I don't want to be in positions where I have to rely too heavily on a sighted partner's interpretation. The second occasion I experienced difficulty occurred when one of my sighted partners matched me up with a visually impaired person for the next sequence in the workshop. I found that I couldn't get any rapport or positive contact going. This did shatter my confidence for the rest of the session that day, and although I did manage to resolve the issue with the person who initiated it later, perhaps it might have be"

    "Text": "I am a Childbirth/Parent Educator and a Teacher of Body-Mind CenteringTM. One of the aspects of my work is helping babies and parents \"bond.\" I feel Baby Contact is a perfect way to help parents attune with their babies. I have been experimenting with Baby Contact since my thirteen year old daughter Jenny was born. During the summer of '77 I was working at the School for Body-Mind Centering™ and was fortunate to have had some colleagues invite me to join in some Contact Improvisation. I was fascinated. I was pregnant for the third time and had danced and performed through all my pregnancies. Doing Contact Improvisation while I was pregnant felt like a trio (me, the fetus, and the other adult). In addition to exploring BMC and Contact Improvisation, I was also discovering the Kestenberg work, a method of observing movement and working with child/parent movement interactions. Influenced by these three bodies of work, I was experimenting with dialoguing with the fetus in all sorts of ways: moving in the same rhythms that the fetus within me was moving; initiating the movement; following the fetal movements; leading from the uterus; vibrating the amniotic fluid with sound and movement; letting the weight of the uterus or the fetus adjust my relationship with gravity; as well as anything else that happened as a result of the continually changing dialogue within my body. After Jenny was born, the natural continuation was to keep dancing, with her on my body, using the same dialogue-sometimes following, sometimes leading; two energies creating one ever-changing form, contacting each other through movement and stillness. My Baby/Parent group began experimenting with Baby Contact, first the parent lying and breathing with their baby, just listening to their baby; then feeling their baby initiate movement, then responding in micro-movements to their baby's movement initiation. We began very gently and very carefully, combining initiating movement and responding to movement, moving and receiving, being motor and sensory. Eventually we built the micromovements into larger movements that moved through space. With Contact one needs to be constantly feeling and re-evaluating, ready to instantaneously respond as well as instantaneously act; one needs to be open to receiving as well as giving; responding as well as initiating. That balance of give and take, in and out, is an important attribute for parents as well as babies. In addition, in Baby Contact, babies have the power to move the environment, of initiating movement through space, of being responded to physically, of initiating change. They also have the experience of incorporating another person's rhythm, of internalizing another person's movement and perhaps even developing it. They also have the opportunity to see the world from many spacial perspectives, stimulating their vestibular system. My students and I have enjoyed Baby Contact and have learned things we could have learned in no other way. We have had.the opportunity to blend our adult bodies with our babies' bodies into one movement.* Baby Contact. photo: Sandra Jamrog"

    "Abstract": "Rick Knowlton explores the potential of Contact Improvisation as a means of accessing deeper human interaction and addressing various social and personal challenges. He discusses its applications in therapy, community building, and kinesthetic re-education, suggesting that Contact can be a powerful tool for fostering empathy, breaking down social barriers, and promoting personal growth.",
    "Text": "by Rick Knowlton excerpt from a two-part essay Perhaps Contact Improvisation first arose as a neat idea rooted in the experimental, freedom-loving '60s, catalyzed in 1972 by Steve Paxton as a situational structure for spontaneous performance. Perhaps Contact is a recreation or a choreographer's tool or a means of therapy with difficult-toreach populations. But to me, Contact is a key to accessing a whole realm of human interaction that most people would not otherwise ever reach. A context in which movement therapies can integrate, chronic social attitudes can relax, the rigid can become spontaneous, the playful can celebrate, the skin's hunger can be fed. There are so many states of body and mind, qualities and depths of touch, invitations for spirit to embody the flesh which I can't imagine occurring so naturally in any other context  Consider, for instance: 11 In Contact Quarterly we often read about dances with alter-abled (i.e., \"disabled\") people. I'm thinking also about the emotional and relationship disabilities of \"able-bodied\" people-emotional limitations rooted in or augmented by physical habits and rigidities. Do our Contact studies consciously span the gap between people of vastly different temperaments? Iii In therapeutic contexts, this movement form can quite literally embody the Gestalt therapy model of \"psychological events occuring at the boundary of the organism,\" (Fritz Perls, The Gestalt Approach). Can our work in Contact approach the more profound boundary problems in our society such as dysfunctional family dynamics, abuse victims, sadomasochistic disorders? Rick Knowlton & Barry Hynum. 11111 Early in this century, F.M. Alexander pioneered what have now become schools of body/mind repatteming/re-education, on the premise that we, as a society, incorrectly interpret our nervous system's kinesthetic information. Is there any better ground for constant kinesthetic feedback, any better place to relearn and re-evaluate our kinesthetic/proprioceptive perception than the Contact duet? 11 Contact Improvisation enjoys a fun, multifaceted, international community of practitioners. There is something special about a community in which you can really touch everybody. Now, what community wouldn't benefit from such a direct invitation to support and empathy? It may seem silly to picture the executive board of I.B.M. upside-down in sweatpants, but what are the actual limitations keeping Contact contained as a special interest of us few? 11 Finally, we are just about to see the first generation of adult children of Contact dancers. Are they just regular kids whose parents have a weird hobby-or have they been exposed to a world of free energetic flow barely dreamed of by the likes of Wilhelm Reich? Ill If not, why not? I'm writing perhaps not so much of what Contact Improvisation is as of what I feel it can be. Ten years after first learning the form, I still have the very highest expectations of what this simple movement practice offers. On the eve of Contact's twentieth birthday, where has it already gone? Are there not countless frontiers still awaiting this movement? *"

    "Text": "I recently had an opportunity to teach contact improvisation (CD in Mexico City, Mexico. \"The Winter Workshop Intensive for Dance Professionals,\" which took place at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Institute of Fine Arts), was attended by professional dancers and dance students from all over Mexico. For three weeks I taught two 2-hour classes a day, one with students and the other with dance professionals. The workshop took place from December 1-20, 1991. Other instructors for this intensive were Sara Pearson, Patrick Widrig, Jeremy Nelson, Nancy Topf, and Daniel Nagrin. Jaime Ortega and Marcella Broughton, who are dancers from New York City, were our translators. The organizer of the event was Lidya Romero, Director of Dance at the Instituto. Lidya and our other hosts were very gracious and the students were extremely receptive to new ideas, both in body and mind. They had been exposed to only a bit of CI before and were mostly trained in Graham technique, so I expected bodies that were not malleable to CI, but I was wrong. They learned the skills and form of CI very well and were willing and able to integrate this different movement paradigm into their bodies. The workshop setting presented me with the opportunity to rediscover the beginnings of the CI form for myself. I decided to ask questions to help focus my teaching: What is contact improvisation? What is my point of view of the form? How is it taught to dancers who know very little about it? What is the essence of CI and its basic skills? What do I think are the most important things to get across about the form? Even though I have taught CI to beginners many times, I felt more responsible because this was another country and the dance ideas out of which CI originated had not permeated their culture. Besides, it's exciting to start from the beginning again after so many years. I enjoy a:;:king questions and gaining new perspectives and getting fresh insights. I divided the basics into different categories: internal skills such as awareness of inner space, including gravity, mass, weight, and volume; learning to give and take weight; and following a continually changing point of physical contact. There are also several senses that need to be developed when learning CI, whether learned consciously or unconsciously. These are the sense of weight shifting, the proprioceptive sense, the kinesthetic sense, and the disorientation of the vestibular sense of balance. There are also a number of physical skills that can be taught and practiced including \"nameable\" skills such as rolling, sluffing off, platforming and draping, body surfing, falling, giving and taking weight, and counterbalancing. Dancing contact improvisation is about learning a new movement language based on these senses and skills. CI is a type of whole body dance technique. You get the experience of the body-as-a-unit. IT brings you to an altered state similar to that of an athlete. You become adrenalized and sensitive to lower brain reflexes so that you are able to make split second decisions about falling, breaking falls, and taking other physical risks. In addition, you learn to follow impulses from moment to moment and to communicate those impulses through your body. You also become adept at listening to impulses from another body. I allotted plenty of time for open dancing so that skills and concepts could be integrated into the dancing. I also set up structures to allow for discussion from the point of view of the dancers as well as from the observers' perspective. I stressed that the form is about dancing from the inside out. First you become aware of and align with the physical forces of nature. On the frrst day, I began with a body awareness exercise; while lying down, sense the mass, weight, volume, gravity, and points of contact with the floor. In standing, I led the experience of the small dance of tiny weight shift adjustments we unconsciously do that keep us in the vertical plane. The next day I introduced the skill of following a continually changing point of physical contact, as well as the concept that weight shifting is a sense. On the third day I did exercises to introduce the idea of maintaining balance while in disorienting relationships to the ground. To sum up, the concepts that I covered the first week are as follows: four senses (proprioceptive, kinesthetic, vestibular (dis)orientation, and weight shifting); aligning with gravity, momentum, and movement impulses; following a continually changing point of physical contact; giving and taking weight; learning the art of controlled free falling; listening with the body. After this first week of introducing the concepts and doing some open dance structures, I wondered about which step to take next to get to the dancing form that I recognize as CL I don't care whether people do ''pure\" CI or not I don't want to be pedantic simply to maintain control, but to insure safety. My interest is in sharing the experience of freely falling through space and aligning with what Cynthia Novack described. in her book Sharing the Dance: Contact Improvisation and American Culture, as the \"third force\" that is both of you and neither of you. Skills are fun in and of themselves and they help you to find new places in your dancing. However, while dancing, you want to be feeling it from the inside rather than looking at it from the outside. CI is not only about learning skills and doing them in a dance. It is also about listening and communicating. It is about sensing where the impulses and motivation for dancing originate. It is about discovering the place where the impulses come out of your physical relationship to each other and the physical forces that you share while in contact The movement ideas arise out of this shared energy relationship. I had these thoughts during the round robins, because although the students were extremely open to the form and the energy ran high, it dissipated very soon instead of building or growing. I wanted to show techniques for letting the momentum of a dance build and also for finding different energy states within a dance. Therefore, for a focus during the second week, I decided to work with the elements of air, water, earth, fire and ether as originally presented in CI by Nancy Stark Smith. In addition, I wanted to expand on disorientation concepts as a way of letting go of the 'egohead' of dancing and allowing the body's reflexive responses to take over. I also continued teaching skills I had introduced in the first week. The \"elements\" turned out to be a good way to talk about and feel the different states and qualities that a dance can have. After a week of focusing on skills and taking them into the dancing, the element of fire (unleashing wild and high energy) added a quality of freedom to the dancing, and the dancers' creative resources seemed more accessible. It was also helpful to use the polarity of air and earth (levity and gravity) and I focused on how to mutate between these two states. Doing water-flow dances without limb support was a helpful approach to changing movement patterns. However, it was when I introduced the element of ether (unpredictable qualities) that the dancing really became engaging, both to watch and to do. Up to that point they had been tied to a form based on a continuum from skills to dancing, much like ballet where steps are combined to make a dance. With the ether concept, there is a whole range of movement qualities that are available to the dancer, and what I feel is the inherent"

    "Abstract": "Steve Paxton recounts his experience at the DanceAbility workshop in Eugene, Oregon, focusing on the integration of disabled and able-bodied individuals through Contact Improvisation. He highlights the challenges and triumphs of participants with various disabilities, emphasizing the empowering nature of dance and the importance of inclusive environments.",
    "Text": "Joint Forces, a dance company founded by Alito Alessi and Karen Nelson, has presented four annual DanceAbility workshops, sharing Contact Improvisation dance with hundreds of people, some able-bodied and some with various physical disabilities. This year's DanceAbility, produced by Alito, took place for 3 days in mid-March, 1991. Eugene, Oregon is a city designed to be wheelchair accessible and has provided the Hilyard Community Center for disabled folk as well. It is a handsome center, and as an able-bodied person, I enjoyed the extra space and wider doors which result when a building is designed to accommodate people who use wheelchairs. A problem for many disabled folk is our society's commercialization of space. It can be difficult these days to get out of a car without chipping paint on the doors of three vehicles. Vans modified to raise and lower wheelchairs need the equivalent of two spaces. So, for those disabled people able to drive to the center on Friday, it was easy to park, descend to ground level, wheel into the building with its automatically opening doors, and attend the orientation meeting for DanceAbility. Originally, DanceAbility was to be held at the Center, but Saturday and Sunday's workshops had to be relocated to a more spacious high school gymnasium. The planners had not foreseen the large turnout for the event; disabled people are known stay-at-homes. Some disabled folk objected to the concept of the purpose-built spanking-new community center for the disabled. The problem is how to integrate the populations, not segregate them into separate facilities. Bruce Curtis noticed that the men's toilet had no urinals, and though admitting it was a detail, felt that it was a symptom of a lack of consideration for the able-bodied, and as if all men with disabilities were in wheelchairs. Getting pissed-off about the pissing facilities expresses the sensitivity of the activist Bruce was invited to DanceAbility as a facilitator. He is a quad-a quadriplegic-in a wheelchair, from San Francisco. He has been active in teaching and performing dances with his able-bodied partner, Alan Ptashek. Alan is a veteran of a movement form called Contact Improvisation, a sort of partnered gymnastic improvisation. He answered the phone one day and found Bruce at the other end. Alan is a gifted partner and he and Bruce, who has no control of his legs or fingers, began to work out together. Most forms of dance partnership suppose that one partner leads, the other responds: in CI however, either dancer may initiate or respond. After the movement starts, a new possibility arises; to follow the momentums established and to continue them while remaining in touch with the other's body. This is the 'contact' part of the form. The 'improvisational' aspect of it allows either partner to be in any position relative to their partner or to the floor. Essentially it is old-fashioned touch dancing taken from the vertical of the ballroom into the horizontals and obliques of wrestling, with, hopefully, the ability of the snooker player to intuit momental affects. Bruce began dancing, I believe, from a political motive, a desire to insure that the equality of the disabled folk was addressed; as well as his own need not to be marginalized, which included not letting his body degenerate in a wheelchair. Bruce came to Eugene without Alan this year, which is a measure of their success, and drove up the coast in a VW bus he had modified to cope with his chair and the ways that his limbs work. He is accepted as a performer, invited as a teacher. Have we heard of a quadriplegic dancer-teacher before? No, we have not. Yet, at DanceAbility, Bruce was not unique. Charlene Curtiss teaches wheelchair aerobics in Seattle, for another instance. Emery Blackwell has recently resigned the presidency of OIL (Oregonians for Independent Living) to devote himself to dance. He has cerebral palsy to a degree which makes speaking difficult Words are stretched. tones distorted. His vocal mechanisms and jaw, like the rest of his body, reflect the aspect of CP which exaggerates the motor nerve impulses, sometimes producing kicking and quavers in the legs, large arm gestures, flexed (athatoid) wrists and extraordinary finger movements. For three years Emery has worked with Alito Alessi and they have made a duet which uses the paraphernalia of the disabled-wheelchairs and crutches. Alito recently had an extraordinary accident A bottle of carbonated water blew up and severed the muscles and tendons of the front of his right leg above the ankle, requiring surgery and extensive rehabilitation. So he has experienced a profound, if temporary, disability. He was no stranger to the disabled; his mother was wheelchair-bound from an auto accident when he was young, and his duet with Emery reflects his familiarity in a playful way with the mechanics of the support systems. Emery has also produced a short solo, for which he made the music on his synthesizer. Bruce, then, is not alone in taking the creative initiative in dance. It is an extraordinary thing they are all doing. We have seen paintings produced by disabled artists; music of distinction has been composed by disabled musicians. However, dance uses the body as a medium. Unlike other arts, when one looks at a dance made by somebody who is disabled one is looking at the dance and also the disability. This contravenes our society's protocol regarding looking at the disabled. But theater exists in part to provide the opportunity for frank appraisal of human beings and perhaps it suits the agenda of disabled performers to use the theatrical conventions to allow us to get used to their conditions. Then they get on with the creation of dance under those conditions, without necessarily referring to them. 1'1~: l L--·--·-··----·-___., _.. ________ --./ These thoughts arose because we saw two dance works featuring Emery at the introduction to the workshop. One was the solo he choreographed in which he rolled across the floor, rose to his knees, turned in place, and then descended and rolled away. What we see is that the rather simple format of the dance is taxing. Emery is working at the edge of his capabilities, just as many dancers do. He is a striking man. The CP exaggerates his movements and features, but his long curly head of hair, his thin face with goatee often wetted with saliva, his intelligent and frequently merry blue eyes suggest a character of some flamboyance. Bruce once said that the disabled are either ignored or viewed as martyrs. But I think Emery would be extraordinary even if the facade of CP did not provide such a lavish filter through which to appreciate his spirit and thoughts. Emery's spirit lights up his actions and face. His thoughts are thoughts set in a new body language. Emery has said that to get his arm raised above his head requires about 20 seconds of imaging to accomplish. Extension and contraction impulses in his muscles fire frequently and unpredictably, and he must somehow select the right impulses consciously, or produce for himself a movement image of the correct quality to get the arm to respond as he wants. We observers can get entranced with what he is doing with his mind. More objectively, we can see that as he tries he excites his motor impulses and the random firing happens with more vigor. His dancing has a built-in Catch-22. And we feel the quandary and see that he is pitched against his nervous system and wins, with effort and a kind of concentration we haven't seen before. He has mechanisms in his mind we able-bodied have not had to learn. His facility with them allows us to feel them subtly in our own minds. The taste of this we get during the short solo is much amplified in the duet with Alito. This dance is longer and requires that Emery be where he needs to be in time to coordinate with Alito. The choreography provides a new filter to show us the man. The CP appears to mask the logic and intent until events show us that what we see has been carefully calculated by Emery and Alito. Can these dances avoid the obvious trap of being curiosities, grotesqueries, or analytical, quasi-medical displays? It depends on the artistry, of course, and the failures of this new geme will probably be absorbed politely, just as the theatrical misadventures of the able-bodied usually are. Theoretically I see no problem. Usually we think of dance as the development of human movement potential to superhuman levels. Another way to look at dance techniques is to notice that they exclude more movement potentials than they develop. Ballet works in the realm of extension of the limbs. It does not include the contractions of Martha Graham nor the asymmetry and sexy pelvis of jazz. Each of these techniques operates within its own logic, and each may borrow or quote from other systems, but at heart they are defined by how they are limited. These definitions are aesthetic ones, though, and it is a difference of kind when the limitations are the result of mischance or malady. But we quickly grasp the logic of the limitation, be it aesthetic choice or physical disability, and this is the point at which the mind and spirit of the performers take over to convey us through the moments they are there to perform. I have seen awful Balanchine ballets. I have seen ballerinas with superb bodies who could not hold my attention for sixty seconds. And conversely, I have seen disabled performers who, without evoking pity or morbid fascination, kept me riveted to their work. Jose Limon, a famous modem dancer, once said he felt most alive when on stage. I have similar feelings, which may be hard to understand by those who don't perform regularly. What happens is that the rigidity and self-consciousness of stage fright change to fluid extra power and deeper self-awareness. For that moment you have more of you. I guess it is adrenalin and other hormones surging through one's system, which mixes with one's own feelings and the feelings of the audience--who are there to witness feelings, after all. What a broth. For Bruce and Emery, perhaps this performance high is the same. I view performance as an empowerment, and a healing, or wholing. They may have found this as well. There is something in it for them, in other words. And if they find it, their transcendence will fuel our transcendence. Will we find it more natural to design the disabled into our urban environments because they will be in/on our minds? Or are we struck with novelty? Will it wear thin? The audience at the Center absorbed the performances with appreciation and then watched a video of last year's DanceAbility workhsop so they could see what they were in for on the weekend. Alito SATURDAY   We were all together from eleven until six p.m., about 60 people at any one time, and slightly fewer disabled than able-bodied which is a comfortable ratio. Not all the disabled needed help, mind you. Those with CP did: Emery, Jeff, Pete, Dana, for instance, are wheelchair bound, and also need others to be 'hands' for them. Jan however is a single amputee who walks with crutches. She teaches skiing and could sit to the floor on her leg and arise as easily. She needed no assistance. Rhoda was my partner for an initial contact improvisation and then a verbal introduction. Having introduced ourselves to each other, we were to then join a circle and introduce our partner to the others in the group. I gave Rhoda my history first. She replied with, \"I have an overeating disorder. And I was molested as a child.\" It seemed clear that she was introducing herself as alterabled. So not everyone had physical dis-ablements. Now I looked around the room with a new attitude, and a sense that even those of us with virtually no cause to consider ourselves disabled might in fact be there for other reasons that a good workout and altruism. I asked Rhoda if I should introduce her as frankly as she had introduced herself to me. She said I should. At the end of that session a couple of women thanked her for her forthrightness. Indeed, why shouldn't people simply declare what happened and clear their air? Rhoda was seeking an experience of safe touch. I believe she found it on this weekend, as we all did. We also got a lot of exercise and physical challenge. It was at first difficult to manipulate a body in or out of a rolling wheelchair. People not in chairs quickly discovered where the brakes were, and learned the advantageous ways to extend the dance beyond the chair. Not that the chair dido 't have a lot of possibilities. Certainly square-dancing arm figures could be used between partners of different abilities. And the chairs are designed for strength so it is possible to clamber up on top of a seated partner, to lay across the armrests, to catch a ride on a backstop or footrest. Several children spent little time in their chairs; being small they spent a lot of time being carried, flown and rocked. Others were heavy to lift and manipulate, and all available contact improvisation skills were used to turn the transitional moments into fluid ones. It certainly seemed possible that someone would be dropped. But it became clear that those who could leave their chairs enjoyed the adventure, and those who couldn't such as Bjo Ashwill with arthritis and a recently operated hand still in traction, knew their limits, which were respected by their partners. As the information that we were in a safe touch, safe adventure environment dawned on us, the warmth grew. First came safety, then came warmth. Then came   well, what one goes dancing for. Meeting people, doing and seeing unusual things, finding physical challenge while laughing. Being moved. Our Western society has marginalized physicality. Not just to mention the voluntary couch potatoes, or car potatoes, or office potatoes. We marginalize physicality by smoothing the environment, contriving convenience. By removing its challenges we reduce the environment's ability to stimulate our potentials. There is a trap laid for us by city planners and architects, decorators and designers-the couching of the country. We adore youth, but what with one thing and another-parenthood, jobs, etc.-we lose it too early, then cling to its superficial qualities with makeup and varieties of cosmetic surgery. News services distributed a 'filler' this last summer: the same percent of the U.S. population is overweight today as was in the 1960s. The joggers are more evident, the potatoes are not in the public eye. So if it is normal for us to marginalize physicality, the folk who are disabled are relegated to an even more sedate existence. Emery, however, has found a way out. He is a notorious bicycle rider. He tours Eugene for hours most days, cycling 30-40 miles on a bike specially designed for him. With this and dancing with Alito he has a body packed densely with muscle; and when he is lifted, the hoister quickly realizes that, although he appears slim and cannot control many actions, his is an athletic body. Gerry Overington, who is blind, finds most available forms of exercise boring. Tandem cycling or running, without the visuals, is just work for the legs and a little wind on the face. Touch dancing with a sighted partner allows Gerry to move his body freely, without worry about the space. Gerry has become proficient at contact improvisation because it provides the fun of moving, and because he and his partner meet as equals in the sense of touch. For the quads, paraplegics, CPs, etc., the exploration of spherical movement retains its thrills, and the kinetic pleasure of leaving the chair and having a dance which includes rolling, taking and giving weight, guiding and being guided, accelerating, pausing, and balancing alone provides enormous stimulation. Emery and Pete seemed to become rapturous when dances went well. The spirit of the event was nothing like the usual physical therapy. In fact there is no 'therapeutic contract' with the participants. The contract is to experience contact improvisation. With the video and the performances of Friday evening everyone had a notion of what it is. But teaching it physically is another, more complex, matter. A group including various disabilities is like a United Nations of the senses. Instructions must be translated into specifics appropriate for those on legs, wheels, crutches and must be signed for the deaf. Demonstrations must be verbalized for those who can't see, which is in itself a translating skill, because English is not a very flexible language in terms of the body. Questions and discussions may be slowed by the inability of some of the participants to speak clearly, or at all. Pete, for instance, communicates by glancing at letters and numbers on a plexiglass board. Sighting through the plastic and meeting Pete's gaze, the reader can see the letter Pete is looking at When it is verbally identified, he changes to the next letter. This is ingenious, if laborious, but Pete's patience never seems strained. Several children were both physically disabled and deaf, and Penny, a fluent signer, was on hand to ensure they weren't left out Bruce called the large group to order every so often and talked about skills of weight-giving or rolling. Perhaps he was not so concerned with imparting skills as changing the atmosphere from the good-natured chaos which tended to prevail to one where anyone who was confused., or in an unhappy partnership could find ground and conscious change. The rest of us who were there to facilitate, Karen Nelson, K.J. Holmes, Riccardo Morrison, Alito and I, tended to roam the gymnasium looking for difficulties. We would expect at least some minor difficulties in such a huge mixed group of relative non-dancers, but few if any were found over the weekend. I think we tended to err on the side of caution. Folk who weren't dancing were choosing to watch or rest But their presence at the event spoke for them. They had come to dance. SUNDAY   And dance they did. All day Saturday, all day Sunday. By Sunday afternoon the gym was spread with picnic lunches and people were casually sharing their food. I sat around a generous spread with a number of others, and realized that most of it had been provided by Rhoda, with her overeating disorder, who had brought enough for others who might have overeating disorders. It was consumed. People talked and laughter echoed often. Children of participants played in and out of groups, appropriating empty wheelchairs to play in. Being children of disabled parents meant they knew how to use them. One toddler had bells on her shoes. Her main amusement was to toddle, and the jingle on her feet let her mother, a young blind woman, know where she was. What her mother didn't see was that her daughter toddled in and out of dancing spaces where adults were contending with difficult balancing and fairly high-level physical forces. Occasionally gasps were raised among watchers. But the child spent ten hours over the weekend doing this and never came to harm. She just tinkled through whizzing wheelchairs and under lifted adults, the bells giving us some warning that she was there. Perhaps having a blind mother gave her a sense of responsibility for her own seeing and moving far beyond her years, because rarely did anyone have to alter movement to accommodate her, and finally everyone accepted that she could participate as she pleased. Another woman brought two kids, a boy of about 8, and a small, sweetfaced girl about 4. This child was not as independent as tinkle-toes, and sometimes wanted to crash her mother's dances-to join in the fun or reclaim her mother's physical attention. Her brother however, with many a strange noise and apparently casual intervention, would divert his little sister. He would step in the way or invent a pulling game, or distract her with a fantasy image. Sometimes this didn't work. When she persisted, she was welcomed into the dance by both dancers. Or mom would see that her daughter did need some individual attention and excuse herself to dance with her. The boy's job was effective though. Part sheepdog, part Charlie Chaplin, he managed to give his mother a lot of dancing time. Emery Pete's Story Pete Theophanes, 19, had in Emery a strong ally in communication.

Outside the main group, a few of us were circled around Pete, taking turns reading through his letter board, trying to figure out what he wanted. Cerebral palsy happens at birth. If born with an inability to consciously control one's body, including speech, it can be a struggle to convince the world to take one's mind seriously. Pete's body has to be propped up in the wheelchair, 234 CQ/CI Sourcebook Volume 17 1992 with both elbows tucked inside the armrests, or he slumps alarmingly to one side. His wrists are flexed 90 degrees. Pete could control only the direction of his eyes. Before he learned to read there must have been little communication. On Saturday he had a good time, I gather, because he came again on Sunday, though against the wishes of his grandparents, his guardians. They are devout Christians, and Sunday is the day for church. Nonetheless, they allowed Pete to return for the middle part of Sunday's workshop. Pete didn't want to go home. He wanted to explain that we should call his aide and tell him to come at 6 rather than at 4 p.m. But as interpreters we were too tired to keep this long sequence of letters in mind. Emery sat pondering as several of us tried and failed. Suddenly he got it and said, \"What about your grandparents? We'll have to phone.\" Pete's excitement was contagious at this point. He was grinning and sighting out his message: \"Phone her, tell her I'll be home at 6. And hang up before she can answer.\" It came to me to make that call. I could not follow Pete's script, though. I had been warned about the strength of personality of Pete's grandmother, and in the event my proposal of a two-hour extension for Pete was swept aside. Pete had to get ready for church. His driver was coming. These aides are sometimes in delicate relationships. When Pete's aide learned what Pete wanted, he was tom between Pete's needs and rights, and the agreed arrangements. Pete was proposing to change that arrangement on his own, yet if the aide granted Pete that power, he would be dismissed, or in hot water, at least. Pete, at 19, is legally able to determine his own schedule. And grandparents might be old-fashioned, stuck in their ways, and overprotective. But an agreement had been made. Those engrossed with Pete and this issue, an island where time went by in the single letters of the complex story, were Emery, Alito, the aide, myself and a young woman named Gani. Though sympathetic to Pete's desires, we were counselling a pragmatic approach: don't jeopardize your aide and stress your grandparent's generosity for just two more hours of fun. It could curtail future chances. Gani, to her credit, said, \"Having heard their advice, if you still want to stay I'll support your decision.\" Pete needed that support. Circumstances had deprived him of the power to execute his wishes. Friends counselled against his direction. But at least one person put Pete's wishes at top priority. Gani recognized his right to do a thing, albeit a rash one, and kept her focus right there, rather than looking sagely at the larger picture. When I returned from the phone call and told Pete what his grandmother said, Pete emitted a peculiar sound. It was a shriek through clenched teeth. The intensity of frustration was ominous, but quickly passed-on the outside. Pete was invited to a last dance, and was lifted into the air by four dancers, and soon was smiling down at us as they paraded by. His aide allowed this little extra time, then Pete left; back to a world where there would be no parades, nor much movement at all. He would, we were told, be taken from bed in the morning to a couch, where Volume 17 1992 he would watch T.V. and his spasming legs would be tied to protect him from falling off. Or on fair days, he would be wheeled into the yard for airing and sunning, his arms tucked inside the armrests of his chair. No wonder he enjoyed the movement this weekend. I hope his tardiness didn't harm his relationship to his aide, or to Emery who had invited him. Emery believes Pete can live, as Emery does, in a place of his own with an aide. Knowing someone who believes this encourages Pete to try to achieve it. How does a person get from here to there but by belief? What encourages belief like the agreement of one's 'big brother'? Emery is important to Pete. Until the last moment before DanceAbility began it was not clear that video coverage could be afforded. Tom Giebink, from Austin, agreed to exchange taping for participation and made a visual record of the weekend. The tapes usually focus on a pair of dancers and some exciting moments were preserved. But beyond the immediate subjects the background extends like a savannah and the event is rather like a wildlife film-herds on the Serengeti of Africa, with different animals grazing and interacting peacefully, young ones tripping through the foreground, encounters, withdrawals, peripheral activities. This effect is heightened by the live music which was provided on Sunday by Suse Millimon. It was amplified voice and keyboard with long chords. The atmosphere it made was meditative and earthy. To shoot the fmal meeting Sunday afternoon, Tom sat in the center of the circle around which we all sat or squatted, hunkered down in. It was a moment for every voice to be heard, or read. People spoke up when there was silent space and they felt moved. Most participants thanked the other participants, and the organizers. It was difficult not to be a little teary inside. We bad spent three days together and a warm bond had grown. Everyone bad bad fun, been treated with dignity; so we respected each other and felt an intense vicarious pleasure in each other's smiles and laughter. A large family group was beaded by the Klopen-Owens, a couple from Corvallis, Caucasian, who have 4 kids-at least 3 of whom were from India, two of whom were deaf, one of these with CP as well. He was Dana, a small 9 year-old. Dana is a bit athatoid, like Emery, with bent wrists, and is unable to stand alone. At some point Sunday morning Alito had placed him in my arms. He was a light bundle and felt fragile. During this dance I became hopelessly confused about Dana. For one thing, he had frequent involuntary movement of his head which was, in ordinary body language, 'no'. When he became excited he squealed. His smile was bright and handsome, but when he was asked a question, the effort of answering caused it to fade. The sort of CQICI Sourcebook 235 question I asked was, \"Is this OK?\" The smile would fade, the head shake 'no'. When carried on my shoulder, he shouted, \"Dad, Dad!\" and shrilled a squeal. A bit insecure by this point, I assumed he was frightened. Later I discovered he just wanted his dad to see him, like most kids. But most perplexing was an event which occurred middance. The enormous gymnasium was constructed with a raised center ceiling panel, and between this and one of the side panels a forlorn basketball was lodged, having soared and stuck. Lifting Dana high, I said, \"Do you see that basketball?\" and he immediately said, \"How did it get there?\" So ordinary. Later I was told that Dana was deaf, and I never heard another sentence from him. It does sometimes happen; a state of grace slips in during an unconsidered moment, and clarity emerges. But when self-conscious or under social pressure, grace goes and communication is strained with the distortions and complications attending the affliction. Penny used sign language with him, and we have on tape what I take as an interesting misunderstanding between them. Alito was dancing with Dana, and Penny chanced by. Alito asked her to ask Dana if what he was doing was OK. She sign-mimed the question. Dana thought it over. His smile faded, his head shook from side to side, and with effort he made a sound To me it sounded affmnative. Penny thought it was negative and asked if he wanted to go slower, if anything had hurt his body. Dana struggled to reply. He had trouble coordinating 'yes' and 'no'. Now he had to convey that nothing hurt, and that he loved to fly. Alito intuited what was going on and said, \"Naw, he wants to go fast, don't you?\" Dana grinned. So Alito, holding Dana in the cup of his belly, rocked over backwards, and continued to rock forward and back, higher and higher. Dana's smile got bigger and wider. Later I saw Dana's father flying him. With his hands under Dana's arms, he swooped him up from the floor, circling him high into the air and back to the floor. This probably was what Dana was accustomed to. As we were saying goodbye to each other in the final group circle, Dana's mother and father spoke for their kids. They thanked all of us who had touched their children's lives, and Mrs. Klopen-Owen thanked us all for giving her a day off. \"We did hope that Dana would meet others like him. It isn't easy for a little guy with CP to find a role model. But luckily for him, Dana has found Emery, and has something for him.\" And with that, Mr. Klopen-Owen held up Dana's arm. Clutched in the small hand was a yellow scrap of paper. \"His address!\" Dana's head was, for once, not wavering. His gaze was fixed on Emery, and he grinned hugely as his arm was raised. Alito Alessi, Pete Theophanes and Emery Blackwell at DanceAbility, 1991. 236 CQ/CI Saurcebook Volume 17 1992 But then no one knew what to do. A protocol had been tacitly accepted not to give aid unnecessarily. So his parents did not convey the address, or Dana, across the circle to Emery. Dana fidgeted off of his father's lap, and a few feet beyond Then his coordination failed him and he lay, limbs moving uselessly, still trying to get to Emery. Emery was hip to it and reacted quickly. He heaved himself off the several friends he was draped across and heaved and rolled, just as in his solo, over the expanse of the gym floor. No one moved to help him, either. Spasmodically, grotesquely, Emery humped over to Dana. He attempted to take the paper, but a further problem emerged; neither he nor Dana could make their hands work to make the transfer. Emery's fingers were all coiling with effort, but not coordinating. Dana's hand could not unclench. Emery began to emit groans. Failing to refine his motor effort, Emery tried to envelop Dana, address and all. Both were, at this point, on the floor at angles to each other and no available coordination created the cuddle which was intended In the attempt, Emery was flailing Dana with his wrists, and emitting involuntary roars of effort. Dana was mostly without expression, looking dazed Fortunately a smile appeared to reassure us viewers that he was not frightened by the energy directed at him. He might well have supposed that his role model was trying to devour him. Dana managed to unloose the note. It fell onto Emery's chest, then to the floor between them. Emery knew he couldn't manage the finesse of picking a paper up from the floor, and rose unsteadily to his knees above Dana. His arms stretched out from his shoulders and his wrists bent down with fmgers writhing like sea anemonies. He looked like a mad magician triumphantly incanting over his victim; or possibly about to topple on his victim. But then, all these images are beside the point. These are masks, the body language thrown up by CP, which cause a confusion in interpretation. All Emery was trying to do was hug Dana, and this he managed, .sort of. He rolled Dana up against his knees, then sank down beside him, pinned him with his forearm, and nuzzled Dana with his goatee. Dana grinned Finally someone from the circle spoke. \"Will anyone describe what's happening for those who can't see?\" It was the stuff of old Russian novels, or operas, or long silent films, but as I described it it flattened in my mouth into a street comer encounter. What a high failure of communication. Fifty-eight people saw a moment of drama, and the blind heard only the plot line. The sighted heard my pitiful effort, but only a couple of people spoke. Under the pressure of the moment we gave up and in silence felt the gaps between the senses. Emery meanwhile was declaiming •.• something. \"Songay ewiri whyyeahh ooeyer.\" \"Someday,\" Emery was telling Dana, \"we will ride bicycles together.\" + Volume 17 1992 CQ/CI Sourcebook Z37"

    "Abstract": "This article reviews the performance dance piece \"Wheels of Fortune\" created by Alito Alessi and Emery Blackwell. The piece explores the emotional entanglements of physical shape, speed, and movement, using wheelchairs, crutches, and a kitchen chair as props.",
    "Text": "The kleig lights click into total black. A single round spotlight creates a circle on the black, bare stage floor. The audience hears a metallic rattle and a thumping sound. Into the light, lurching and then pausing, lurching and then pausing, staggers a manual wheelchair. A man seated in the chair, wearing a second manual wheelchair like an Iron Maiden over his head and torso, is pushed into the light by the power of a man with cerebral palsy walking on his knees. Two crutches, hanging off the back handles of the first chair, drag alongside this clunky, noisy entourage. The performance dance piece Wheels of Fortune, created by Alito Alessi of Joint Forces Dance Company and Emery Blackwell, has begun. The two men then explore the \"in's\" and \"out's\" of wheelchairs, crutches and a single straight backed kitchen chair. The space, the props, the emotional entanglements of physical shape, speed and movement are used to their full advantage. It is an emotionally powerful piece. Why? Is it the subject matter? Or is it the dancing? Is it the fact that one man has a physical disability? It is impossible to sort out all the factors and isolate what exactly motivates the positive response and feedback it receives. Maybe it doesn't matter. The end result is perhaps what is important. But Emery Blackwell, a dancer and a man with a disability, sometimes wonders. It is hard to measure how much of the response is to his talents as a dancer and how much is ·the audience's preconceived notions of how little a person with a disability can actually accomplish. If the audience believes people with cerebral palsy can't do much more than hang out in a chair and spasm, then anything he does on stage will create a \"standing ovation.\" Emery, the dancer, has a hard time reading the responses accurately. Honest feedback is what he wants. An example of how people view him throu~ their own disability \"biases\" or \"filters\" came at a feedback session at the Breitenbush Contact Jam in Oregon. Emery had danced his solo piece There and Baclc Again. Several of the dancers made comments like how powerful his smile was when he rose from the floor and up onto his knees. And how sad they felt when he went from the kneeling position back to rolling on the floor. To them, the dance meant that for a few brief moments a person with a disability rose up, nearly standing (like them), but fell back into the agonies of disability. When asked what was in his mind when he choreographed the piece, Emery said, \"It's a piece about cycles. I am a flower blooming. It grows to full bloom and then dies, to bloom again. It's about joy and spring.\" 238 CQ;t:I Sourcebook Volume17 1992 Emery has been a man with a physical disability all his life. Being Emery, the dancer, is a new wrinkle. And he loves it Asked if he considered himself a dancer or someone who plays with dancing, he responded, \"I think in time I will study to be a dancer. At first, it was fun. I spent a few weekends and the time moved on. Alito pushed me more into dance and I got more into it after that first performance of Wheels of Fortune. After I worked with Alito all winter, I got hooked. Then I started questioning if people took me as a dancer or just as a gimp. I would label myself a beginning intermediate dancer. I know some basic Contact, but I feel I am new with it. You know, if it weren't for Alito, I wouldn't be dancing. He was open-minded and positive. He even reminds me that my own movements are normal and natural. I keep forgetting, trying to dance like the able-bodied. Me, thumping my knees on the floor, is dancing. Not disability dance technique-but just plain dancing.\" All this \"dance stuff' happened one day, several years ago, in 1988. Emery's first love was and still is bike riding. Emery was wheeling down the sidewalk on his three-wheeled cycle, a helmet on his head, strapped in like an astronaut straining against gravity and pining for the open roads where he could feel the wind racing past his face, pushing against him in a rough and friendly embrace, like wrestling with a good buddy. Suddenly, a smiling man flagged him down and handed him a flyer, yapping on about some kind of DanceAbility workshop where people with disabilities and able-bodied people get together and dance. \"It's called Contact Improvisation. You'll love it,\" Alito continued. \"Sure,\" smiled Emery, taking his flyer. Anything to appease this very friendly, obvious nut \"Sure, I'll come,\" he said and wheeled off, not giving it another thought. The universe, in her gentle way, never leaves things to just a single chance. She places more than one hint in front of a person. Emery's friend Keith came by and asked Emery to go to this Contact Improvisation workshop with him. Emery shrugged, \"OK.\" It would probably be an all right way to spend a weekend. Why not. So he went. Interesting stuff started to happen. \"C ::r 0 ~ ::0 0 g. c fl> ~ 3 c s   ~ Emery in front of WOW Hall, Eugene, 1991. Volume 17 1992 People with all kinds of disabilities were sliding out of their wheelchairs and rolling around on the floor, moving with able-bodied people. That, in and of itself, wasn't so unusual. Physical Therapy and Therapeutic Recreation created that kind of experience. What was different was the feeling. The attitude. These people weren't trying to make Emery move faster or differently than his body could or wanted to. These people didn't sit there, waiting, with disguised impatience as Emery tried to catch up to them. No. These people acknowledged his body, its particular movement style and speed as perfectly normal and acceptable. Just as Emery had done since birth. More than that, they actively appreciated his movements as something they'd like to learn to experience, to use in their own repertoire in dances. Alito has often said that he creates the DanceAbility workshops for selfish reasons. Most people credit him with a do-gooder attitude of bringing dance and movement to the disabled. \"Ain't he just such a good-hearted guy?\" Alito laughs. \"I do this because it brings me more information I can use in my own exploration of physical movement and dance. Everyone has body movement habits. In order to break my habits, I try on other people's movements, like a new hat or a shirt. I gain a great deal from people with disabilities. They show me how to move and experience my body in new ways.\" Emery laughs, \"You learn by other people's movements. It's the opposite for me. I'm learning to relax and explore my own movements, without the pressure from others to do it 'more normally' or faster. It's freedom to feel my own natural rhythms and be accepted and enjoyed for being exactly who I am.\" Emery went to several DanceAbility workshops, which are presented once a year. After the second workshop, Emery attended another Joint Forces event-the Breitenbush Contact Jam, an annual weeklong international gathering of contact improvisors. At that first jam, Emery realized there was more to this dance than just having fun. Here, he created and performed in his first choreography, a group piece called Bumped. Asked how he created Bumped, Emery described it in this way: \"I was trying to get across that I am not disabled and that anyone could become disabled any time. Sometimes when you are seen as disabled, you become invisible. I was coming back to the jam after spending a day at the Salem Legislature lobbying for the rights of the disabled. I was thinking about that experience. They thought I was disabled, but when I returned to the jam, CQICI Sourcebook 239 photo: Cliff Coles Alito Alessi and Emery Blackwell in Wheels of Fortune. these people did not think of me as disabled. Hey, neat, I thought That would be a neat dance. I was thinking of my political work, how I always try to tell them you have more chances of becoming disabled than you do winning the lottery!! \"So, at the jam, four of us were playing around with the idea. I told them the main idea and we worked from that. Everything else just fell into place.\" When someone was bumped into the wheelchair, they became invisible and the others would continue dancing, bumping into the wheelchair without noticing it or the person in it Then the person would get bumped out of the chair and become visible and the others would begin relating to them again and someone else would get knocked into the chair and become invisible, etc. \"The chair made the piece either fast or slow. If you dance with a chair, it governs the speed. \"I'll tell you something else,\" Emery continued. \"Dance has helped me reach people more powerfully than my years of lobbying the legislature have. As President of OIL (Oregonians for Independent Living), I have spent hours (which sometimes feels more like years) 240 CQ;O Sourcebook intellectually talking about equality, equal access, that we are people too, just like everyone else. I'd talk and talk and make small progress. But one dance and people just 'get' it. It opens up communication in more equal ways.\" Alito and Emery did a performance for the Governor's Arts Awards at the Hult Center in Eugene, Oregon. After the show, Emery sat back, trying to be out of the way, but he failed! These people, white, rich, older, the same people Emery lobbied at the State House, came up to him. They lined up to express their admiration about the dance. They responded to Emery in just the same way the Eugene schoolchildren did. Emery and Alito did their dance for 8 different schools in a three week period. Five thousand kids saw Emery and Alito dance. A barrier had been broken. It was OK to reach out and talk to this human being. The dance made people question their own enculturated thinking. The Wheels of Fortune dance is all about who supports whom, what helps what, who is disabled and who is able-bodied. Sometimes the wheelchair supports Emery, sometimes Alito. Sometimes Emery supports the chair, or Alito wears the chair, or a \"normal\" chair (one without wheels, a mere Chevrolet compared to a Cadillac) is the support. It all twists and turns, changing like a kaleidoscope. That is the truth. And that truth is different than the set-inconcrete notions of the general \"temporarily able-bodied\" person. They think the chair holds up the person, period. End of discussion. The piece dances around the question of 'What is normal?\" That isn't a question that Emery spends much time on. He knows what is normal. His body and the way it moves is normal That's the way it has been from birth. Unlike a person who meets with an accident later on, Emery has no memories of it being different. The trouble is that other people haven't always agreed. They spent time and energy trying to get Emery's body to move differently and faster. When he was growing up, he'd get around by crawling on his knees everywhere. The floor, the lawn, the gravel, it didn't matter. Then he got a manual wheelchair. He'd propel himself around by pushing himself backwards, looking over his right shoulder to see where he was going. As a result, the skin on his knees went soft, no longer calloused, making him unable to crawl over the ground without pain. Now, that was a disability. At the age of 18, Emery got a power wheelchair and suddenly had to change his body habits and look forward in order to avoid crashing into walls and running over people. For the first time in his life~ he felt disabled. It was a change from old habits. He had to adjust to it.

Feeling disabled was not an always kind of thing; it would occasionally pop into Emery's head, but mostly, he was thinking about bike riding. After he was introduced to the bike, he spent some time struggling, barely able to get around the block. With practice and time, he now tours around the state, on weeklong treks, zooming downhill at 35 miles an hour. What Emery loves about bike riding is the same thing he's learning to love about dance. Freedom, acceptance and being in control independently. Contact Improvisation has made some changes in Emery's life. Physically, he has learned to move more smoothly with better balance. On bike rides, Emery used to push hard and with jerky movements to propel his bike on the 40 or more mile treks. Now, his pacing is softer, smoother and more powerful A clear demonstration of his capability at better balancing happened in the bathtub. He fell and his body used the new dance techniques of rolling he had learned. A safe landing. He learned to have more fun. Actually, that's not true. Emery always has fun. He learned a new way to have fun when he began dancing. One of the major commitments Alito and Emery have in their dance work is to have fun as they are dancing. If they are having fun, this will telegraph to the audience who will be able to relax more and have fun with them. Emery discovered the power of the unspoken word-the speech of dance and movement that tells stories and feelings more completely than the spoken word. Although the main reason Emery dances is for the fun and for the personal experience and satisfaction, he can't avoid the educational aspects of his dancing. Simply because he is disabled, everything he does teaches. Dance, Emery has learned, is a marvelous, positive teaching tool. He will be volunteering his time giving performances in the schools and Alito is working on grant proposals to create a weeklong DanceAbility workshop next year. At the DanceAbility workshops, people have more time to interact with him, Emery notes-to experience him long enough to break through their own mental barriers. Often people start out hesitant or outright reluctant \"It is the difficulty understanding my speech, I think, that distresses them the most After they realize I am an intelligent human being, they feel relieved,\" Emery says. An interesting thing happens for Emery at these workshops. There are people at the workshop that are \"more disabled\" than he is. And Emery finds that he tends to relate more with the able-bodied participants than with the more disabled. Having to slow his movements down to dance with people with more severe disabilities than he has (and less dance experience), Emery began to understand and have more empathy for able-bodied people who have to slow down their movements to dance with him. Emery forgets he's disabled. At the same time, dancing with ablebodied people makes him realize he is disabled. Makes him aware of the differences. Is that good or bad? Maybe both. It depends on how he's feeling at that moment about himself. If he's in a good mood and feeling good about himself, it's good. If he's tired or feeling less sure of himself, it feels uncomfortable. It is all a part of the learning process. At one jam, Emery danced with Gerry Overington of England. Gerry is blind. Emery had never danced with someone who couldn't take visual cues as to what the next move might be. Now Emery was experiencing what ablebodied people experience when they dance with him: assuming they need to take more responsibility for leading, initiating the movement. This was a somewhat new experience for Emery. His dances have evolved from a passive responding to a more active pursuit and exploration of movement in contact with others in space. But, isn't that what Contact Improvisation is all about? Emery also has gained the personal freedom of acceptance. Among dancers, he is accepted as a dancer. His own normal body movements and speeds are fine just the way they are. You know, it's funny that society has decided to label someone who walks differently or not at all as disabled. Often, it's the so-called \"able-bodied\" person with fine motor skills, that has disabilities-like not being able to get along well with others, or express their emotions, or feeling unhappy and depressed. When people who are struggling with their own pain see someone physically disabled, they often project their initer feelings of inadequacy and pain onto the disabled person. They latch onto the disabled person, wanting to help them, soothe their supposed pain and make everything all better. The trouble is, it doesn't work. It backfires. Because it's not the disabled person's pain. It's theirs. People often say how it hurts them to hear Emery's knees thump on the floor during his dance, thinking it hurts him. Emery says, \"Sure, sometimes it hurts. Mostly, it doesn't. But everything in life costs a little pain. If you want to really help, let me experience my own pain my own way.\" People at dance workshops are often worried they will hurt Emery, but he's as tough as hickory wood. By being afraid to roll on him or put weight on him, they lessen the dance experience for both of them. Emery tries to tell them it's OK; after they get over their original resistance, Emery gets bounced off the walls and loves it In the workshops, it also happens that people often talk to somebody else when they are talking to Emery, as though they think he is deaf as well as has speech problems. But these are minor annoyances, ones Emery meets with every day of his life. What Emery gains from dance is well worth the difficulties. Dance has widened his circle of friends. Like bike riding, it has given him an opportunity to meet people on an equal basis. Dance speaks for him, breaking down barriers and walls like so many tinker toys.* This article is 'based on conversations between Emery Blackwell, Alita Alessi and the author in March, 1991."

    "Text": "Exposed to Gravity workshop, Berkeley. by Alan Ptashek In the Fall of 1990, with Bruce Curtis, co-founder of The Exposed To Gravity Project, I began teaching a course at The University of California at Berkeley called The Moving Body. Having facilitated movement workshops for disabled and non-disabled adults, adolescents and children for five years, Bruce and I were interested in bringing our work into the university setting where movement exploration could be sustained throughout a semester-length period of time. The city of Berkeley bas one of the most visible and active disabled communities in this country. At the university, several organizations are centered around the creation of programs and services for both the public and student disabled populations. Despite the efforts of independent recreational sports programs on campus, disabled students lacked support and inclusion from the Physical Education or Dance Departments. While issues such as liability and accessibility were often heard, there clearly were no university instructors who had the orientation and skills with which to develop a viable course where people of different abilities could move and interact with one another. The Exposed To Gravity Project was given county and campus organizational support and we designed and implemented a course through the Department of Dance and Dramatic Arts. Undergraduate and graduatelevel students would receive academic credit and provisions were made for allowing public participation as well. Few administrators nor faculty fully understood the history or scope of our work and they had no precedent for a course of this nature from any other college or university in the country. With a class of twenty five students, we had an even ratio of those with and without physical disabilities. Students were majoring in and doing graduate studies in dance, theatre, psychology, anthropology, social welfare and public health. Disabilities included multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, polio, arthritis and spinal-cord related injuries resulting in paraplegia and quadriplegia. Discussing disabilities as limitations and differences that are not always apparent, several people in the class considered themselves as having \"hidden disabilities,\" such as chronic fatigue syndrome. As in all of our past workshops, there were mixed feelings of excitement, caution, confusion and an appreciation for new possibilities. As a movement practice, Contact Improvisation has been at the center of our work, providing a coherent physical language for all participants. The focus on physicality and sensation established a ground for the stimulation and discussion of personal, social and political issues that became immediately relevant and integral to The Moving Body. This course is one that feeds into areas that are societal, clinical, bio-medical, theoretical, educative, psychological, artistic, performanceoriented and, largely, improvisational. Steven E. Brown, in his article, \"Creating a Disability Mythology,\" adds what may be another component area of the course, or an entire container holding all of the before-mentioned areas. He says: \"Language, humor, music, stereotypes, history, heroes. Each of these shared experiences comprise elements of a culture. People with disabilities are beginning to recognize that we, as a group, have been developing each of the aforementioned topics into our own culture-a disability culture. I am convinced that every community harbors many heroes with disabilities. I believe it is time to work on the development of a disability mythology. Myth is more accessible than a documented history of events; myth permits us to be creative and expand our tale into a story to be repeated and retold for generations, a form understood by every other culture.\" We live in a culture that holds strict definitions and value judgements about what it sees as moving and not moving. With so much of daily motion and perception dictated by task, function and particular examples of productivity, movement at deeper levels than external appearances are less valued, ignored, and, at worst, unperceived. How we are being seen by others influences our self-image, presence and movements in the world. In our classes, I feel that we were creating new layers of a collective story, a body politic or body mythology. Myths take shape in a ritualized space. Several guest teachers (Dance and Drama Therapist, Bronwyn Warren; Feldenkrais teacher, Lawrence Goldfarb; and Dance Therapist, Neala Haze) were invited to present their work during the semester. Neala facilitated a session in Authentic Movement. Having each student move with eyes closed, \"witnessed\" by the group, was a beautiful and evocative ritual space. We were able to appreciate the most subtly articulated movements of each person, sensing and referring to our own bodies for the depth of response we gave one another. The experiential practice of the course was augmented with readings on dance, performance history, body systems, developmental movement, perception, sensory awareness, somatic therapies, communication theories and the use of touch in human experience. Students kept journals and papers were part of the requirements for academic credit. Many of the early classes brought forth the awkwardness and anxiety around physical touch between disabled and non-disabled partnering. It is very common for non-disabled people to feel hesitant and fearful of having physical contact with a person in a wheelchair or one whose physical form is shaped and moves differently than their own. Often it is assumed that the disabled person is brittle, in pain or umesponsive to being touched. In the class, students were strongly encouraged to express their needs, physical functioning and capabilities to one another. This exchange of personal information helped to relax them and elicit trust of an improvised and collaborative spirit. When encouraged to leave their wheelchair or crutches through their own movement or with assistance, the initial experiences of many disabled students (and of the non-disabled assistant) ranged from extreme disorientation and vulnerability, to pleasure and intense joy. A contained and safe environment in which to express feelings is very important in this context. The process of dialoguing after dancing allowed for us to speak from changes in self-image and self-organization with increased awareness, sensitivity and a mutual regard for one another as moving, embodied beings in the world Our learning environment carried as much influence as any of the specific skills for falling and supporting weight. Deane Juhan, in his book Job's Body (Station Hill Press, 1987), conveys a layer of this learning environment from a physiological understanding: \"The process is anything but random or trial and error. It is highly specific, and it is the periphery which helps to organize the connections in the central nervous system, not an organized central nervous system which reaches out to innervate the periphery. It suggests that the use of touch and sensation to modify our experience of peripheral conditions exerts an active influence upon the organization of reflexes and body image deep within the central nervous system.\" Clearly, not all of the class participants came with the same intentions and interests. Most students, both disabled and non-disabled, loved the freedom to play and seek new physical forms, to feel themselves buoyant and resilient, fearless and beautiful in their dance. In the past year, I've been facilitating groups and workshops for professionals who work with or wish to extend their practice to physically disabled men and women. While working with movement and somatic practitioners, the focus is on how we make contact with ourselves while touching, supporting and moving with someone who has a physical disability. We look at ways to establish more of a peer relationship. This process is a risky one. Conventional and traditional techniques are challenged, while mutual dependency and the unknown are brought into the relationship. This is a process that medical science has little familiarity with. The impact of this course as expressed through responses from the students and faculty of The Moving Body strongly indicate a need and desire for the continuance of this work in university, clinical, community and artistic settings. * The Moving Body was videotaped and is available to the public (see Dance Map in this issue)."

    "Text": "a lecture by Aat Hougee delivered along with an improvised performance by Karen Nelson and KJ Holmes at the 7th European Contact Teachers Conference Geneva, Switzerland October 28, 1991 First introduction There must be a deeper reason for me standing here and for Karen and KJ being here, with me on stage, at the same time. An important reason is that it will certainly be less boring this way. Probably the best reason. Many of the decisions I have taken in my professional life during the last 17 years seem to have come out of nowhere. I don't dance, I am not an artist. but in my work as an organizer of art. I do try to follow my intuition. This is about the sixth lecture I am giving in collaboration with performers. So it might be time to find out why I have been making that choice. [Karen reading Aat's notes]: ''To learn about dance, I had to fall in love with a dancer, and another one and anoth· er one. I know, it just comes out in words and figures, but I've gone as far as I could. Much too far, but which dancer doesn't ••• \" Aat Hougee was co-director of the Modem Dance Department of the State Theaterschool in Amsterdam, Holland (now called the School/or New Dance Development, SNDD),from 1975 to 1989. He currently directs the Center for New Dance Development (CNDO), a department of the College of Arts in Arnhem, The Netherlands, which he co-founded in 1989. These institutions are conservatories, in effect, specializing in new forms of training dancers that have been developing in the U.S. and Europe over the last twenty years. Putting myself in the position of a lecturer means that I will have to use words to communicate my ideas. By using words and using a language that most of us will understand. we tend to create a situation that is quite characteristic for most educational systems: it is based on the presence of those who know, or pretend to know, and those who don't know, or pretend not to know. It is a clear division of roles in which most of our ideas about learning find their roots, but somehow I am strongly under the impression that it is exactly this division of roles that keeps both the person in the role of the knowing as well as those who opt for the not-knowing role, from real learning. [Kl reading]: \"As a kid in school I used to know everything better than everybody else. One day the teacher made clear to me that I didn't know anything. That load has stayed with me through the years and it's only whlle watching tv or reading my mys· teries, that I feel secure. Standing here, somebody will come up with a pin, and the balloon will be gone.\" When I started preparing my appearance here, some thoughts came to mind that seem to be quite closely related to the work that all of the people here are involved in. It has to do with the sharing mode of Contact Improvisation and about the challenging aspect of improvisation in general. It seems to be a philosophical problem as well: by using language to enter and clarify aspects of a field that goes beyond language, one immediately seems to reduce the level of thinking and perception. What we want to do here is to create a simple situation which might give us some more insight than just words. I prepared a text including several subjects that deal with the relation between and the development of improvisation, education and an institution. At the same time I would like to offer you a second line of thought-personal, emotional, non-rational. Actually it is that line of thought, some flashes coming from my personal life, my motivation and most of all my fears, that might have been crucial for many of the decisions I have made in my career and for most of the thinking I have developed At this point in my life I think it's possible and certainly more objective, if that's what we are going for, to include these aspects; maybe what I'm trying to say is: once we were convinced that we were on our way, finding the truth, but as we struggled along we started realizing that there is no other truth than the one we are creating ourselves. This personal material I handed out to Karen and KJ and they will work with it, confronting themselves, each other and me with material that is probably closer to not knowing and sharing than what I have to say. We agreed on one thing: we won't talk at the same time. Language as a means of communication tends to be quite vulnerable. And then: your role as an audience, you can take it passively if you like, but there will certainly be one slot where you will be openly invited to come in, but if you feel the need to enter before that, or after, go ahead ----.. A second introduction About watching improvisation. When we go to see a set performance we can expect that the choreographer has developed or has tried to develop work in which he/she knows what will happen from beginning to end We, as an audience, know that the choreographer and the performers know, and with that knowledge we will watch the performance. With improvised work, it's different. The improvising performer enters into a process of discovery and although certain parameters might be known, the performer will confront himself with unknown material and will force himself to take decisions through which new, unknown territories will be entered. Sometimes these decisions will lead to clear solutions, but just as often there will be emptiness, a search for solutions. An audience watching this kind of work needs to be in a different state of mind than an audience witnessing set work. When we buy a ticket at the box-office for a set performance, it's almost like buying a product in a store: whether we like the product or not, one thing will be clear-it's supposed to be a complete product, meant to be consumed like it is and we don't have to add something unless the instructions say we have to, but in general, the product is ready for use. An improvised performance will confront us with a very different situation: the ticket we buy at the box-office does not stand for a finished product. Those tickets I would like to call \"shares.\" By buying one, the spectator becomes a share-holder: sharing the risk that the performer is taking, being present at the performance in a state of mind which will equally value brilliant solutions as well as struggle and despair, exciting moments as well as emptiness. (cont'd) Some history [Kl & Karen reading together]: \"When I got this job, now 17 years ago, I was nobody, but nobody knew. It was 1975 and having some fantasy would. open doors. I had never seen any dance and after some weeks this Dutch choreographer told me that if I wanted to do something for the dance in Holland, I should quit my job. I had to cry, since what else could I do without a real profession.'' It was 1975 when I entered the field of dance education. I was 29 years old, had no history in dance, but Amsterdam was still a playful city where fantasy was valued as a valid motivation for getting a job. It would be quite an interesting story to lead you thr_ough the development of the Modem Dance Department's program and staff, especially since in that development, in the organization as well as in the curriculum, the anarchistic force and strength of improvisation has been quite striking. But what I think is more interesting here is to look at the development of the students during those years and how that development relates to the material the school has been offering and is offering now: what were the abilities and needs of the students at that time and what has changed since. In 1975 the main educational objective seemed to be: to teach students how to move, how to use their bodies in a more complete way, to change their thinking about movement and dance--that dance is about movement, that it is a creative act, and that copying historical form, suffering and sweating, are not the right ingredients to train a dancer. At that time we would get two types of students. There were those who saw being a dancer as meeting with accepted standards, to be reached through intensive daily training, strongly dominated by imitation of existing form. Most of those students, however, were lacking the discipline to work in such a way, partly due to the times we were living in. Also, those students often had interesting ideas, where the traditional training wouldn't give them the right skill to realize those ideas. There were other students who came without these kinds of traditional expectations about their training. In many cases disappointed with previous theoretical university studies, they were ready to dive into this new world of explorative physical and mental work. Quite a few of those students, however, tended to take the work as a vehicle for selfdiscovery. They were often not very motivated to be performers, nor were they very interested in stretching their"

    "Authors": [],
    "Abstract": "This article discusses the challenges and possibilities of incorporating Contact Improvisation (CI) into a dance school curriculum, reflecting on the author's experiences at a school in Amsterdam. It explores the initial enthusiasm for CI, the difficulties in establishing it as a regular part of the program, and the eventual integration of its principles into a broader approach to dance training.",
    "Text": "It was 1985. The first Contact Teachers Conference took place at the school in Amsterdam. Steve Paxton was there, not attending the conference, but teaching at the school, working with improvisational scores. One afternoon we were standing in the ball and through the window in the door we could see the meeting of the Contact teachers. At that moment, Steve said: \"Somehow I would like to open the door and say 'no'.\" This is an anecdote, maybe I made it up myself, maybe it was really said, but even if I made it up myself, I experienced this as one of these moments that became crucial for the development of my thinking since. When Contact Improvisation entered the school, which happened through an introduction by Pauline de Groot [around 1980] and a little later through workshops taught by David Woodberry, Steve Paxton, Lisa Nelson, Nancy Stark Smith, Christie Svane, Danny Lepkoff and Mark Tompkins, it did add many new elements to our thinking about dance, improvisation and especially about dance-training. Although strongly related to other forms we were using at that time-release-work, alignment and several improvisational approaches-Contact seemed to work as an integrative force as well as offering a very physical alternative approach to training. For us it felt new in terms of vocabulary, and also in the teacher/student relation it offered new exciting forms. It seemed to be open, explorative, daring. I remember that around that time the Trisha Brown Company came to the school for a lecture/demonstration, and several of the more traditional Dutch choreographers were there as well. One of them asked about the training of the dancers, suggesting that they certainly would have a strong traditional background. It was Randy Warshaw who answered the question saying: \"No, my only training was Contact Improvisation.\" It felt like a true moment of Victory! After this first intensive introduction to Contact Improvisation, we considered giving it a more permanent place in the program, not just in the form of intensive workhsops, but on a regular basis. At that moment, looking at the content and format of the work, we were certainly convinced that C.L could offer a creative and realistic alternative to replace at least part of the more traditional technique classes. But the problem was that unfortunately there were no teachers available who would be willing to teach on a regular basis. We did try to organize a regular jam, but that initiative, which came from the students, only lasted for a few weeks. In the years after, we kept bringing guest-teachers to teach C.L workshops. It always would stimulate the enthusiasm in the school, and time after time we tried regular scheduling, using local teachers as well as long-term guests, but it never really succeeded. Contact never took the place that we thought it deserved. An important reason for why this happened can probably be found within C.L itself. C.L has mainly been developed (outside of institutions) in short workshops with students who made a free choice to do this work and who were not overloaded with all the other approaches a school program offers. In those workshops, methods of teaching were developed in relation to the specific demands of short and ()pen worksllop ~ituatic:ms. Cl:>ntact Improvisation was and is not about· a historically defmed form, like most of the other approaches to dance used in education, but about exploration in a democratic and social environment. Students who study within an institutional situation seem to develop a tendency to pass responsibilities on to their teachers: \"You tell me what I have to do, I might protest, but if you don't tell me I will protest as well.\" Work that is taught through this principle will normally fit in easily. Contact Improvisation worked in the school program as long as it was set up as a very special event. The lack of authority within the work made it impossible to use on a regular basis as a replacement for more defined dance forms. All this was quite a while ago. A lot has changed since, especially when we look at the expectations and mentality of the students who join the school. I think by now C.L could have become part of the regular curriculum. But again it didn't. Why? During the first fifteen years of development of the school we collected a whole range of alternative methods to train dancers. Finding out about these methods, bow they can be used in a school situation, how they are relating to each other, etc. took a lot of time and energy. Through regular workshops, C.I. played an important role in this process. Although we managed to learn more and more about these methods, and especially about how to use them in a more efficient way, we realized at a certain point that studying these methods should never become a goal in itself. And so we made the choice to use elements of them in the program in an integrated way, but not to use any of the methods in a pure form as a specialist option. During these years in Amsterdam,. people unconnected to the school would often make remarks about the work being too introverted, not outgoing enough. At that time we would become quite defensive when remarks like that were made. Understandable. New approaches are hardly ever clearly recognized and we were also in the middle of a process of discovering the applications of new methods that certainly did require a reflective attitude. Combining this process-oriented work with more form-oriented traditional methods was something many of the students were asking for: but in our opinion at that point in time, we saw these as being conflicting approaches. I don't think we ever lost our belief in the importance of form, but how to get to that non-historical form, how to develop a way of working that would allow an ongoing process of change in form, that was a new path we had to find first, through exploring all those different methods that connect physical development with the use of imagination. During my last years as a director of the school in Amsterdam, a model was developed where the different alternative \"techniques\" were having a clear position in the program, through regular classes or through carefully planned intensive workshops. Although it felt as if we had finally reached the point where we were able to give full value to the new work, there were doubts coming up as well. At a certain point, one of the teachers, who had been teaching t'ai chi for many years, retired. Students and staff were asking: \"Who will be teaching t'ai chi next year?\". My first reaction was-we'll have to find a replacement. My answer was, however: \"Nobody. We won't have t'ai chi next year.\" At that moment I realized that making a program based on subjects would, through time, inevitably lead to a static situation, comparable with the situation most traditional modem dance schools are in, working with methoc:ls and ideas of people who (artistically) died long ago. In our opinion, a school for dance should have one main objective: to train students to be artists who will be able to develop new forms through the use of physical means. An objective like this does not allow any limitations. Methods to develop creative and physical skills are just methods to reach a goal that lies beyond these methods. Contact Improvisation is one of them and any artist using improvisation as a way to discover new form, will not accept the limitations that are part of this method, or of any method, but will in fact include anything that will support this process. Does that mean, since many elements of Contact Improvisation have been defined, that that's the end of C.L? Certainly not. C.L has added several innovative aspects to the training of dancers that cannot be found in other approaches. Part of teaching C.I. is teaching students to find improvisational solutions within a certain frame of thought. At the same time, artistically, we want students to break through existing frames of thought and we want teachers in their teaching to be clear about that. Because that is exactly the lesson we learned from our battle with previous approaches to dance education: the importance of teaching the creative process instead of already-defined form, teaching physical skill through the use of physical and creative imagery, instead of forcing students to go through forms that are no longer connected with this time. Teaching C.I. in these terms means teaching the knowledge that has been developed tl:lrougfi tfils · work, but it means at the same time teaching a mentality that will stimulate a next generation to go beyond the results of that: to fmd new solutions, even if that would mean the disappearance of C.L as it is known to us at this moment. I realize that I am able to say much of what I say because I have been able to work from a relatively comfortable position. Comfortable in the sense that we did get the space and the funding to go through this development. When I look around me in Europe, I see many studios offering workshops. It is great that that happens, but most of the workshops are quite short and they are often not able to offer sufficient continuity for students, nor for teachers. Students are not able to receive government support for their studies and because of fmancial reasons most of the studios are not able to select their students. In an institution there is continuity, for students as well as for staff, and we are able to develop material over a longer period of time. We do have problems as well. Motivation can be one of them, sometimes things can be too easy. It is inevitable that, slowly, alternative approaches to dance will enter most of the existing dance institutions. The question is, however: in what form will that happen and what status will they get. Most institutions work through a simple model in which the teaching is based on a clear image of what a student who has gone through the program should look like. This is not just a matter of style, it is a very specific idea about education. But even institutions like that will, as time goes by, start including new approaches. Not the process-aspect of the new work, but probably the form of it. And since those forms are certainly more interesting and connected with this time than forms they have been using until now, it will be experienced as quite a revolution. However, when it's about improvisational work, it could be like a trap. Improvisation, I think, including C.1, basically is an anarchistic phenomenon. It is about finding new solutions. Changing existing structures and allowing it into a static educational system would mean, if we are not just teaching a form, the beginning of the destruction of that system, unless one would adjust the work itself to make it fit into the system. Within 20 years from now the Dutch National Ballet will include Contact duet forms in their grand gala performances and every ballet school will have their weekly Contact hour. In the year 2010, C.I. will have taken over the place that Graham Technique occupies now. But also in the year 2010 there will be some people struggling somewhere in a small studio, maybe in a few institutions, trying to develop work that goes beyond Contact. And ·if there happens to be a conference that year, I am sure Steve Paxton will appear, look through that window, and whisper \"no\" again. * One of the reasons why we have been able to develop two schools in The Netherlands has been the fact that we were able, and made the conscious choice, to enter the institutions on a formal level. We gained power, not through the work itself. The work that was done in the studios, the performances we made, hardly ever received any positive recognition. It was on the level of management, educational organization and strategy that we gained respect and established our role. By doing this we managed to create a comparatively safe environment in which the seeds that were planted by many artists in this field could develop. Within this framework there was no need for compromise and especially no need to let the work establish itself in a too recognizable and static form."

If it were shouted in a crowd I would feel it deeply. But it comes from you in your brown brick ivory tower. I read it through again: .. . no other truth than the one we are creating ourselves,\" and see that it has a selfserving logic. Also, who are \"we,\" here: The staff and teachers at your school? Them, plus the students? The whole human race? Whomever it may be, suppose someone is off creating a truth of their own; do we then have two equal but different truths? What about those who found truth for themselves in times gone by? What will happen to your truth as future generations create their own? None of these seem durable, singular truths. They seem to be temporary, subjective truths. They seem to be all in our minds. This is not good enough. We know it's all in our minds. The problem is, as it always has been, what to do about it If we are going to be fair about it, one thing we must do about it is not trash the truths of others. Your chilly remarks about traditional forms created by (artistically) dead people through which students must be forced, toss aside the truths of many people, alive and (really) dead. Why? They are not perfect truths, of course, but you are speaking of the dance tradition in the West which every teacher at your institute knows, and which I also studied and which gave me a lot of the basis for Contact Improvisation. Did you imagine that Contact Improvisation dropped out of the sky? You use it in your institute as if it were unconnected from past techniques. But so intertwined is it with modem dance (and modern to ballet) that to dismiss any of the past dance work is to orphan it It eliminates a lot of the training which I assumed would be part of the studies of people who use it Have you noticed that there are no exercises for the feet or legs in the typical contact class? I assumed that the feet, legs, circulatory systems and joints from the past were quite substantial truths and there was no immediate need to replace or erase them. Furthermore, I assumed that these people would also be studying Tai Chi Chuan and Aikido, so I made CI a sort of bridge for Western (traditional) dance students into the unfamiliar Eastern forms. It is an inclusive approach, based perhaps on advice I heard from Pauline Koner, a famous modem dancer: to study as many techniques as I could with integrity. I found this excellent guidance because the real study is the human body, and in the various technical materials from different times and cultures a larger range of information was available to help with perennial problems: awareness, efficiency, longevity. 'To study' meant to get it into the body, not only the mind, which I think requires at least 2 years of regular class in the specific technique to embody the essentials. Is there some way to use 'truth' which is not so subjective? To follow Pauline Koner's advice creates the hope that one's subjective understanding will continue to grow, and more parts of one's body will come under conscious training. It takes one from the narrow confines of preliminary understanding to a broader attitude which can see other truths than one's own (yet continue to see one's own). In the aims you mention, \"   to get to that non-historical form, to develop a way of working that allows an ongoing process of change in form,\" you have a very clear description of the aims of modern dance, founded at the end of the last century. (Happy Centenary, Modem Dance.) Ballet training of foot and leg have been retained, however. You are a pure modem dancer and a bit of a redneck, but these appalling qualities will not be punished. The past doesn't care, and you are surrounded and supported by its gifts, even though you don't seem to realize it Contact Improvisation is not anarchistic, because it is a formal cooperation. It is difficult in academic programs because it has no standard which can be graded, which may be as difficult for the students to understand as for the staff to cope with. It is to be experienced rather than judged, and our modem dance research above suggests that the experience begins to deepen after two years of regular classes and goes on deepening, widening, furthering, whatever. You don't 'get there'. Steve Paxton Vermont"

    "Text": "THE FOUNTAIN AT I.D.E.A. The Fountain is a form for collective watching and reporting one's experience of watching. It is a direct way of sharing with a dancer some evidence of what happened in each of us as we watched her dance. It can be used for listening to music, poetry, looking at a painting, etc., just as well. !rs most important feature is that discussion is not allowed: It has four parts: 1. Watching 2. Writing-immediately, for 3 minutes, in silence 3. Reading-out loud, in a circle, only what you wrote 4. Collecting and printing what was written by Christina Svane In August 1991, feeling a collective need for feedback and support in the new dance and performance community, I conceived of I.D.E.A. (International Dance Exchange, Amsterdam). In October, I collaborated with Dutch choreographer Pauline de Groot to create a platform for such an exchange-monthly I.D.E.A. meetings at Pauline's studio \"DE KOE.\" On the Saturday closest to the middle of the month, I.D.E.A. sponsors an open showing of work and performance/audience interaction structures, followed by informal exchange. At these meetings, I have been developing a form called The Fountain, in which spontaneous reflections are written during a three-minute pause between dances/performances. These spontaneous writings are read, without discussion, at the end of the entire showing. The writings are then gathered and published in the now-bimonthly I.D.E.A LOG, nee I.D.E.A. Newsletter. The Fountain form and its resultant writings constitute the beginning of an on-going experiment central to the purpose of I.D.E.A.: To further the exploration of dance as a collective experience in present time and space, and to create forms through which glimpses of that experience can be passed. Over the course of the first I.D.E.A. meetings, I found that by restricting formal performance feedback to only reading what was written during the three minutes between seeing pieces kept the exchange vital, surprising and full of imagination. To be in communication with, rather than about, what was seen opened up a more direct and creative transference between audience and performer, an exchange in the dimension dance comes from: the imagination. The model is conversation: taking each dance as a statement and responding likewise. The realness of the moment and our mutual share in creating that moment is not conditioned or tamed in any way by calling a dance a \"work-in-progress.\" The moment is still absolute; the future we envision may never arrive; the improvements we seek are secondary. In conversation, someone says to you, \"I love you!\" You don't respond by telling them they should focus more on their pronunciation. You say, \"I love you, too.\" Or you say something else. So this experiment is a challenge to us to be in the moment with the performer. Although my dream is to have a gathering of all kinds of artists, all kinds of people, the truth remains that we as an audience for each other are primarily dancers. And this is, we are, a gold mine of attention -'-highly developed attention-for each other. As dancers we are skilled as listeners-listening to our sensations, to the moment we are in, to the transformation of energy through the moment, to the level of statement that moves you when you see it. It is this wonderful degree of listening that we bring with us to each Open Showing. The dances are the tips of the icebergs of our experience. They are the part we can show. For complete i"

    "Abstract": "Steve Paxton reflects on the challenges of defining Contact Improvisation (CI) and explores techniques for training the senses and consciousness in relation to movement. He discusses the importance of fall consciousness, the role of images in initiating movement, and the need to address gaps in awareness during reflexive actions. Paxton also touches on the cultural influences on physical behavior and the potential for reclaiming suppressed physical possibilities through CI.",
    "Text": "by Steve Paxton How awkwardly we are damned if we don't or if we do, I thought to myself after the European Contact Conference in Berlin in 1988. During a lecture event I had been asked, \"Just what is Contact Improvisation?\" and I had muffed the answer. I was being asked by a woman with an attitude, in the presence of a number of veteran contactors, general public, and students, and I hesitated in order to think how the question should be answered for the whole group. The discussion up to that point had been full of historical revisions, elisions, pointed remarks about Americentric heavy-footedness. In short, the European contactors considered themselves second generation users of this form and wanted to know if they had to go through every step the Americans had gone through; and a few people who had come to the conference without prior experience ju~t wanted an explanation of what this whole thing was and how it was run and how did one improve and get recognition-things like that, which would be reasonable questions in a normal organization. The journal you are now reading had, among other things, been working for 15 years to elaborate on the basic answer to \"what is CI?\" And as time has gone on, the answer has shifted: away from an experimental dance phenomenon and toward a physical practice allied with a number of complex new body and mind studies. I have come to think of contact improvisation as a physical event best described negativelynot art, not sport, not most of the things which characterize dancing in this century. But I hate to describe things in the negative. It is accurate, but the mystics used it first and I don't like using their devices, which were used to try to inform students in conversations about the ineffable. We, on the other hand, are trying to describe the corporeal. But it is no longer easy to do so. It is, in fact, getting more difficult We now know too much, or think we do; the corporeal seems to be a complexity of social, physical, geometric, glandular, political, intimate, and personal information which is not easily renderable. Once things were relatively simple. I thought I knew how this then-nameless work should not be described. It was to be an improvisation without any ambiguous appeals to the imagination, because I did not know precisely what \"the imagination\" was (in fact I thought doing this work might educate me to the meanings of imagination, improvisation etc.). For the same reason there should be no mention of sexuality, psychology, spirituality. I would leave these in the hands of the experts and proceed with what seemed more immediate-the senses and the physical body. It did seem that before I could begin to train the senses of students, something had to happen in their brains. In recognizing that we do not begin to move from zero, that first we have a desire or image to launch the system into action, I decided that I had to work in the area of images, though cautiously. The images were to be, well, \"real.\" That is, they were not to be obviously umeal. The effect of obviously unreal images upon the body is fascinating. For example, if you are told to imagine (that word!) your head is filled with a gas that's lighter than air, it is difficult not to respond with neck extension and postural straightening. Why should this be so? It may be related to the sort of mobilization which happens when we are searching for a lost object-first, the thought of the object, then the eye movements, the head turning, standing up, facing in different directions, a tentative walk to a new viewpoint or a possible site of the object All this prompted by the mental image of the desired object The responsiveness of the body to the image is innate, apparently, and with this innate connection the body may be responsive to any image the mind holds. But this is speculation about things which should be the subject of investigations. Without a theory of imagination to support our investigations, it seemed to me, we would have to improvise without fictitious gasses in the head-if that were possible. At any rate, I had only about a week to come to convey the central idea before we, a group of apt students and myself, would be doing it in public at the John Weber Gallery in NYC each afternoon. This time pressure meant that this effect of images on the body would be an essential tool for quickly transmitting the initial states which would let this physical duet/improvisation manifest as directly as possible. The first job was to point out this image-action connection. Then, exercises which demonstrate it in various parts of the body had to be produced. For instance, a mental exercise I gave while people were standing, in which they were to \"imagine, but don'tdo it, imagine that you are about to take a step forward with your left foot What is the difference? As you were. Imagine   (repeat). Imagine that you are about to take a step with your right foot Your le~ Right Left. Standing.\" At this point, small smiles sometimes appeared on people's faces and I suspected they felt the effect They had gone on an imaginary walk and had felt their weight responding subtly (but really) to the image; so when \"Standing\" was said, the smiles revealed that they got the small joke. They realized that I knew about the effect We had arrived at an invisible (but real) place together. The stand was useful. The basic event was standing and observing the body. This was an exercise in itself, though a very reductive one. What gets exercised in there, inside the standing body, is the habit of observation; a noticeable movement of consciousness through the body. Within this exercise there are encounters with parts of the body which tick along or breathe along as we watch. It clearly seems to be one sub-system, consciousness, examining others. The other sub-systems are not obviously connected to the wandering consciousness, except that the encounter happens in what one calls \"my body.\" The consciousness-as-observer regards the other sub-systems as separate from itself. The consciousness can travel inside the body. It is analogous to focusing the eyes in the external world. There is also an analogue for peripheral vision, which is the awareness of the whole body with senses open. Knowing these things and practicing them are different things, of course. We know far more than we can practice. We had to decide what to practice. One choice was the tiny movements the body makes while standing. I felt they were examples of reflex actions. They were not directed by the observing consciousness. Observing them might train the consciousness to understand reflex speed without going through an emergency experience which is when we're most often aware of our reflexes. We would be provided with many examples of reflex action when we began improvising in contact, but they might be of little use to us, because the consciousness can easily turn off to the experience of these reflexive moments. In other words, we can do something without \"knowing\" it. This successfully preserves the integrity of the body but does not train the consciousness; it leaves a hole in the knowing of the experience. Could the consciousness learn to see these gaps of awareness? Or, if not, could it at least learn to observe reflexive action calmly during the highly adrenalized moments? Why is fall consciousness so important to me? Because consciousness can be felt to change according to what it experiences. If a gap of consciousness occurs at a critical moment, we lose an opportunity to learn from the moment. A black-out lasting fractions of a second during a roll is not acceptable as full consciousness of the roll, and the gap will remain embedded in the movement as part of the over-all feeling of the movement. If consciousness stays open during these critical moments, it will have an experience of them, and will enlarge its concept to match the new experience. This expanded picture becomes the new ground for moving. _My s_pecuh!tion is that _ the gaps are mo01~n!S_ Vlh~n consciousness goes away. I don't know where. But I think I know why. Something is happening which is too fast for thought. For instance, the navigation of space is normally done with bead erect and visual impressions comfortably constant, with the horizon's horizontality remaining an important reference for our orientation. When this visual reference changes too rapidly for our (rather slow) consciousness to comprehend, as in spinning, rolling, and other \"disorienting\" movement, something reflexive and much faster than consciousness takes over. We play with this dual aspect of ourselves on carnival rides, or when learning to turn in dance. Dizziness and nausea are, I think, signals that we have reached the borderland between these two aspects of physical control-conscious and reflexive. When we linger in the borderland on purpose, we become our own experiment. We are subjecting the reflexes to stimuli so our consciousness can watch them jump. Normally, consciousness easily slips out, reflexes step in, and then step aside again, as in the blink of an eye where most of the time we are unaware of any gap in our visual continuity. Visual continuity is one of many ways we know \"where we are,\" and not knowing where we are is experienced as an emergency situation. How many times a day, or an hour, do we re-orient, I wonder. At any rate, contact improvisation constantly challenges one's orientation: visual, directional, balance, and where in the body the consciousness is positioned. The challenge to orientation is not just in the more acrobatic aspects of the movement. Students were sometimes made nauseous by noticing their internal space while standing still. This, oddly enough, is probably a form of motionsickness, which bas been described as having a moving deck under one's feet but a steady horizon. In the stand, one experiences still feet and moving consciousness inside the body. In rolling or turning, the room seems (from the point of view of the eyes) to move, while the floor remains stable to the touch. What I bad to do was resolve the problem of orientation so that the consciousness could stay aware of the movement. A chicken and egg problem. Everyone in this group was athletic and many of them were dancers, so presumably their consciousness bad already been informed by body movement. But they weren't being asked to do what they knew bow do to. They were being asked to improvise; to do (or allow themselves to do) what they didn't expect to do. Under these circumstances previously learned movement techniqq.es often hamper rather than help the desired sort of manifestation. Movement techniques are useful for other reasons, of course, but not for examining gaps of consciousness during unexpected movement. Consciousness, supported by a collection of images and internal ob'servations which reinforced each other, had a job. It should not press the body, nor engage in time travel out of the body into memories or schedules because these bring images which will also affect the body, distracting from the improvisation at band. In this improvisation the consciousness was to hang in with the body, during real time, and stay alert. It should be a witness. This sort of consciousness-awareness of the present physical reality-is familiar to all of us. In fact the reason it is useful is that it is commonly understood, though employing it requires choices. Without a process of sorting we are confronted with such a variety of current physical images that we are inundated rather than guided into a practice. As the right kind of images were found, a working model began to emerge in my mind. The working model was based on aspects of an experience that I'd had while working with another person, in which an interesting event occurred and was confirmed by both of us. Moments of the duet, typically manifesting as \"accidental\" and flowing streams of movement, were for both of us pleasant, highly stimulating, and elemental. With other partners, more confirmations. It was worth pursuing. The working model was predicated on this experience and a desire to articulate the experience so others could find it. If others did find it, we were perhaps examining a basic mode of communication between the reflexes of people in physical contact as they moved. It was an idea which took two people to have. It wasn't wrestling, embracing, sex, social dancing, though it was an element of all of those. It needed a name, so we could refer to it without unwanted connotations. Contact Improvisation   ? To envision the exercises, I took the working model to be a simple imaginary person with no physical, sensorial, or social inhibitions. It was a generic person with positive elements I had observed in many students, dancers, martial artists, and children. I had met such a being in my partners when we were doing \"it,\" the duet phenomenon. I had been such a being to them, apparently,. when they too confirmed the moment. It had to be a fairly simple model, because the users (the students and I) were actually functioning human beings with more possible neuronal connections than there are particles in the universe. I could not cope with that of course, nor other evident human complexities. In terms of the safety of the body in active interaction with another body, though, I saw I could ask the student to concentrate on movement and how it feels, and then suggest concentrating on the sensations of their weight, momentum, friction, the touch of their partner, the sensation of the floor under their body, and to learn to maintain their peripheral vision of the space. The working model had these characteristics and others equally easy to understand These were aimed at security, not at improvising. I recall saying that improvising could not be taught, though it could be learned. But I did think that safety could be taught \"Keep your knees over your toes,\" for instance, is taught to students of dance. With the characteristics of the working model developed and understood by the students, I hoped they would be safe even if they were ass-over-teakettle. I pressed on. I made assumptions. I assumed I could explain things directly to the body (\"notice gravity\"). I assumed the body knew what I was talking about (gravity, usually ignored, moves into focus as a sensation of weight). I assumed that the body, having evolved for millions of years on this planet, was tuned first by planetary things which create our potentials, and second by cultural things which develop select parts of the potential. This is in line with some current theories about how we acquire language; we are born with potential to make the variety of human sounds and language connections, but are guided into the specific language of our culture, and the unused potential withers with disuse. For the working model, the basic question was-potential for what? What had the culture physically suppressed or selected out which we might reclaim? We may, with a bit of experience of sub-cultures of our own, and other cultures, understand something of what our culture requires of us for inclusion: certain gestures, modes of posture and behavior-body language, as they say-which constitute proper social activities and communications, as well as the accompanying mental attitudes we acquire or aspire to for proper presentation of our 'selves'. Indeed, the very idea of a 'self is probably a cultural construction. In sports and dance the rules of physical behavior are altered from the basic social behaviors to encompass activities understood to be outside the social norm but allowable in a controlled way. These activities require different sensing modes than does the usual body language we must learn for eating in company or attending school. The working model and its characteristics were like sports and dance in that they were altered. However, they depart from one another in how they are learned. Contact Improvisation behavior evolves from sensing movement; dance and sports, from attempting movement and then letting the senses fall into line, or not. \"517t+£<~\\t;.i'ri..,  'S ? A<..€. As to how we are educated  Not to become too embroiled in this, we may simply note that most of us learn to sit still and focus our attention for hours each day. The missing potential here is obvious movement of the body and varieties of peripheral sensing. Our alterations involved the investigation of space, time, and mass with senses in peripheral sensing mode: space becomes spherical, time is the present, mass is a changeable orientation to gravity. In devising an approach to this working model of the body, I skipped blithely by constraints and taboos of touching, because people are accustomed to ignoring them on the subway, during sports, or in the doctor's office. And I did not emphasize the unpredictable nature of the improvisation, akin to dancing on constantly shifting ground, but suggested instead a steady state of watching the reflexes. Let the reflexes figure out how to deal with the unpredictable. This method aimed to reclaim physical possibilities which may have become dormant, senses we have been trained to disregard. What would this lead to, really? It sounds very nice, this reclaiming and opening, but where would these changes take us? Who would we be? When we began, in 1972, I went boldly into all this. The people in the group were young, healthy, and alert I assumed that if we didn't consciously focus on problems we wouldn't create them, and at least such difficulties as surfaced would not have been projected. As I said earlier, things seemed simpler then. It was to be assumed that some of these students would eventually teach something of what they were doing to others, and I felt the need to develop this material in such a way that the students were aware of the teaching mechanisms. It boiled down to making the principles-physical, mental, and cultural-known to them as they learned them. We had the services of Steve Christiansen and his video camera and spent hours, when we were not working on the mat, examining the movement and ourselves, the movers. · This was very useful. Video was, in those days, a new tool for witnessing the body/mind, and let us see points in action when we were operative but not conscious. Such moments, noticed with the help of the videotape or close observation by a partner, could later be examined in action. Clues about the nature of the gap might be noticed. We began to notice where the gaps appeared, at any rate, and something of their frequency. We also noticed high unfettered moments (and recalled the accompanying feelings). And we observed fettered duets where reflexive movement was not to be seen. Sometimes people seemed wary, unable to let go of conscious control. Disorientation, fear, or fixed habitual responses would be noticed. In the working model, events of the emotions and disorientations which were felt in conjunction with a gap in awareness were considered to be symptomatic that the senses wer~ not ~uite ready to--report what was happening to the consciousness, that instead they were reporting to the reflexive part of the mind and body. I couldn't understand the wary duets. Obviously trust was missing. With some other partner or on some other day, this tended to change. All I could do to cope with this mode was to have partners change regularly. Eventually everyone found a duet which led them to their reflexes. When I proposed movement techniques they sometimes contravened ingrained movement habits: for instance, the aikido roll, which is a diagonally forward roll that arrived on our shores from the Orient. At the very attempt at this roll, students translated it into a somersault, the symmetrical forward roll we learn in Western movement. This misunderstanding could persist through any number of repetitions of examples and attempts and was seriously frustrating to both the students and me. If they couldn't put their finger on what was going wrong, I decided, it was perhaps because nothing in previous movement experience had prepared them for the movement principles which were developed in the Eastern martial arts. These repeated attempts at the aikido roll provided the first gap I noticed. The act of propelling the body into the roll is slightly scary, and many people have open eyes before and after the roll, but in the moment when they are taking weight on their neck and shoulders, they have their eyes squeezed shut, and they are not aware that this is so. I did not solve this two-part problem in time for the first performance, nor for many years after, though the students did perfect their somersaults. I learned that before the body could find the new rolling pattern it was useful for it to learn the sensations which an aikido roll creates. The new sensations, and the parts of the arm, shoulder, and back where the sensations arise in the roll, could be explored without committing the whole body to the roll. This changed the position of the consciousness relative to the exercise. Instead of an unknown action vs. an habitual known action which is so similar that it subverts the attempt, the student has two knowable actions. One is new, tentative, but understood through the sensorial model. The other is habitual. Having remedied the first difficulty by establishing the difference between the two concepts of rolling, the gaps of consciousness in either could be ferreted out. These explorations evolved into new technical approaches. It was noticeable that the approaches require that the student workwith helpfolmental attitudes as-wellas-directly with the physical body. In the aikido roll example above, it was less helpful to know the pattern mentally and try willfully to do it than it was to become an observer of the sensations and to work calmly on each emotional, orientational, or habitual block as it arose. The quality of consciousness was coming into focus. It. wasn't all of consciousness and all possible interactions, of course. A working model for consciousness in this case is Swiss cheese. We buy it as a lump, and don't attend to the holes because we don't use them. I was trying to point to the holes, assuming that if a Swiss cheese could be aware of itself, then the cheesy part was one sort of consciousness and the holes were another sort, integral to the shape, the nature of the whole cheese. We can't take this model much further, I realize; which may be to the advantage of getting on with the movement and its interaction with the consciousness. As we began work on opening up the senses to their larger potential, it became clear that each of the senses has images of differing natures. The Swiss cheese above, mostly a visual image in that I am concentrating on how the cheese looks, occurred in my brain and was transferred to another person by my voice, so it was a verbal transmission of a visual image. What was most needed in our work was kinetic imagery which was both appropriate to the movement mode and true (unlike the speculation about the consciousness of the cheese). The small movements of standing \"still,\" which formed the basis of this sort of investigation, are true; they are really there. But are they images or sensations?

Does the nervous system and its mediation of posture relative to gravity have the possibility of teaching the consciousness, and does the consciousness have the property of amplifying or strengthening that mediation? I assumed this reciprocity did exist I decided that sensations are what we feel to be happening at the moment, and they can become images when we take notice that we are observing them. This suggests that the consciousness can be aware of itself-a defining characteristic-and that there is a positive use for this ability to split into self-regard. However, consciousness doesn't work very well with the unknown, as was revealed in the aikido roll. It seems to need to know or to be noticing in order to direct itself and the body. The attitude of \"witnessing\" may change this internal control issue. The search for internal sensations reveals that \"I can feel the small movements.\" Then our attitude begins to shift toward, \"The body is kept upright by constant reflexive muscular actions around the skeleton.\" First we feel the movements, then we can objectify the feelings into images. The moment between these perceptions can be as short as a hyphen. All the above suggests that there is an important difference between knowing-noticing and noticing-knowing. These are the sorts of thoughts which came to mind during the working period from January to June, 1972. Or to say it in terms of the work: from Magnesium at Oberlin College through the spring term at Bennington College where we further identified the premise, the phenomenon, to the presentation of the work in NYC I called \"contact improvisations.\" Students from those two institutions (plus members of the downtown dance community in NYC who \"sat in\") were joined by students from the classes of Mary Fulkerson at the U. or' Rochester. The Rochester group was least familiar with the proposed movement, and as Fulkerson was teaching them Release Technique via intensive image work, it was in order to reach these students quickly that the approach outlined above was developed beyond what had been necessary at Bennington College. At Bennington, I had begun by introducing these students of Western dance to Aikido techniques. However, I soon abandoned teaching Aikido and started work on specific tools for the interior techniques. Although physical techniques could be found for specific movement training, what those students required was a vision of Eastern martial arts philosophy underlying the techniques (or a viable replacement for that). This laid the ground for introducing an improvisation which requires a state of personal involvement and physical responsibility with/for another person. 260 CQ/CI Saurcebook It must be pointed out that many of the ideas about moving which I used existed before this study. The teachings of Release Technique, Aikido, and several other physical and mental disciplines were influential, and were adjusted according to my understanding at the time in order to convey the movement principles of the area of improvisation described by the words contact improvisation. Beyond that, to enable the movement to be accomplished safely, came physical exercises designed to introduce sensations that arise during \"flying,\" lifting, and being lifted. and to physically strengthen the body for these energetic extremes of the form. Physical strength was seen as the result of finding the right, i.e., easiest, most efficient inner \"pathways.\" Stress was discouraged. We were starting to work on the technical method, a work which continues today, in an effort to describe what Contact Improvisation is on its own terms as a phenomenon of duet movement as well as in the personal terms of a student, who may for instance have physical strength but spatial weakness, or improvisational skills but does not trust their weight to another person. To summarize: images were used to focus the mind and then give the mind foci within the sensations of the body. The words had to be unambiguous, unthreatening, informative and generally understood. The statements had to be true, obvious, relevant. To speak was a.lso to ~ettheton(!. I trieci to simplify the issues of the body for transmission to another body. I moved the mind of my mouth into my body, located issues, and reported the issues speaking (I assumed) directly to another body. The student's consciousness was enlisted to manage attitudes and observe the effect of image on the body, and to derive from these effects, and others observed within their bodies, images which could be named and otherwise objectified and discussed, and fitted into the improvisational structure. I made a number of assumptions. To study something like improvisation, which is defined as you go, everything you assume is going to affect the result I tried to be aware of what the assumptions were and to let the phenomenon we explored, the narrower field of improvisation when communicating via touch with another person, guide the definitive imagery into appropriate areas. This guidance caused us to consider all sorts of things, such as communication, emotion, psychology, sex, education, childhood development, culture, taboos, space, time, and the self. It is all very well to say that one takes responsibility for one's self in improvisation, but it is indeed a staggering job in its details. An improvisor's job is never done. All this to explore the ability of the consciousness to cleave to the body's moment and remain there as the moment changes.*"
