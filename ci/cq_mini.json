It's as if the pressure of holding thesedynamic experiences, flattened together between two covers,standing side by side on a shelf, has finally reached its limit, acritical mass that must explode, transform into another medium,another state.I follow the fountain of pages, CQ 's ultimately untrackable holographicdissemination of embodied dance practice and discovery over thelast 45 years, as the issues unbind and spread out. The aeration isa relief. The dances hover, shimmer, and shift. Gravity hasn't yettaken hold of the bits and brought them back down to earth. Maybeit never will. Maybe new forces are at work here, conditions thatdon't yet have names but do have influence. Maybe our next danceforms, creations, revelations, practices, collaborations, improvisations,breathe a different kind of air, travel best through materials and mediawe haven't yet considered, invented, discovered, or recognized.What you hold in your hands is CQ 's last print periodical publication.Hold it tight. Hold it loose. Savor it. Celebrate its unique 45-year run,in which you have actually played a significant part. Now set it downgently--or enjoy a good hard dash of it to the ground, or just let itfall from your hands and watch gravity take it down. And then comewith us as we shift our editorial weight to CQ Unbound , our year-roundonline publication, and to whatever other adventures come next.In this moment I can feel the familiar thrill of making somethingunfamiliar, the awkwardness and fear and promise of uncertainty,the suspension of belief that allows a new thing to arise, to berecognized and welcomed. We're walking the improvisational talkas we enter this new unknown.I stand in awe of this change. I shift my weight from leg to leg,from land (print) to air (online), not yet certain of the forms thatwill arise to communicate the dancing, thinking, feeling, movementdiscovery, and experiences we will have next.My collaboration with the incomparable brilliance and particularityof Contact Quarterly/Contact Editions codirector and coeditor LisaNelson has been central to CQ over these decades. Together, wehave made manifest the very specific and circumstantial collectionof voices, images, designs, layouts, and formats necessary for CQand Contact Editions. The perpetual friction of our differences hascontinued to irritate, stimulate, and illuminate the passion we havefor encouraging and documenting the articulation of the mysteriesof the moving body. It is one of my life's most unpredictable, precious,challenging, beloved, and valued collaborations.photo by Nancy Stark SmithImprovising at the CQ office, April 2015.And then there's the essential, largely invisible team of brilliantand committed editors and designers that have made the last 20+years of issues possible. Working side by side with me every stepof the way, the designers (Lila Hurwitz, Patrick O'Rourke, and JillApolinario), associate editors (Mary Ramsay, Melinda Buckwalter,Nyx Zierhut, Aretha Aoki, Lailye Weidman, and Meredith Bove), andhardworking CI Newsletter coeditors (Cheryl Pallant, Pen Dale,Sue Lauther, Sara Zolbrod, Neige Christiansen, Dey Summer, andColleen Bartley) have bridged connections between CQ and newgenerations and communities of artists, proofread every commaon the final pages, voiced opinions about page and cover designs,and initiated and followed up on communication with authors. Forpitifully low wages, their commitment and vision have contributedmore to CQ 's legacy than could ever be measured.Right now, I'm picturing the bouquet of issues--with a strongintention of sharing the innovation and inspiration that broughtthem together--unbinding as it flies and, after a long luxurioussuspension, falling in a myriad of delightful ways into your manyunsuspecting hands.With love and profound thanks for your sustained trust andcreative engagement with CQ now, in years past, and in theunknowable and thus infinitely possible future, where ourdancing bodies and minds will continue to meet.Nancy Stark SmithP.S. Part 2 of Throwing the Bouquet (and the original impetusfor that title)--a passing of the Contact Improvisation archivalbaton--will jump the frame of this Note, crossing the bridge toCQ 's online home, CQ Unbound . Read more on our website:Moving Ideas--Physical and Virtual Spaces:CQ & Me & CQ and...I first heard about CQ from Leah Stein in 1994, as anundergraduate student at Swarthmore College [in Swarth-more, PA] when she encouraged us to submit our writingsabout our experiences with CI. It felt exciting to me thata publication would want to hear from college students.I didn't submit in the end, but it was my first exposureto the journal, and I thoroughly enjoyed the articles andespecially the ads and that it was artist led. I noticed theContacts listings in the back of people to reach out towhen traveling, which I did at times.My second significant experience with CQ was in2005, when CQ coeditor Melinda Buckwalter invitedme to write about my project Artifacts of the Ephemeral,which was a residency and installation that took place atChisenhale Dance Space in London, England. The finalarticle, A Moving Installation, appeared in the Place2 issue,CQ Vol. 32.1, Winter/Spring 2007. I was flattered that theeditors wanted to hear about my small project when therewere other, more established artists, and I was also (andstill am) blown away by the attention that the editorialteam gave me in the process of articulating my ideas, theirdesire to understand my practice, and the commitment tohave the writing reflect that, to include details of the feltsense even down to the title.My relationship with CQ changed dramatically whenNancy Stark Smith asked me to be guest coeditor with herof the CQ CI Newsletter in 2012. Our first Skype call wasover six hours long, going over the ins and outs of makingonline and print versions, including photo captions andcredits. We haven't stopped coediting the Newsletter since,and it has developed over the past seven years of our worktogether. The articles have grown in their scope and length.We've improved systems that enable us to edit live onlineand to work remotely. I've had the pleasure to work withVideo still of Colleen Bartley in Walk on Blue, filmed by Richard Bleasdalein 2000 and used as part of Bartley's Meditations on Vulnerability, 2018.the writing from more than 200 authors from about 30countries about their CI practice.It has been a labor of love and a pleasure to workwith dancers and teachers from all over the world who areenthusiastic about CI. I have received an education aboutpublishing, translating, and ways of working with peopleto craft their language (in English) to describe and sharetheir dance practice.I'd like to bookend this story by mentioning my latestperformance at Chisenhale Dance Space in November2018, Meditations on Vulnerability. It is directly related toCQ. I say this because Chisenhale is an artist-led projectthat is about the same age as CQ. It's the place that hasbeen a home to my eclectic practice and has a kinshipwith CI; after Dartington College, Chisenhale is the placein the UK where CI was practiced most abundantly in itsearly years and it supported New Dance and had its ownpublication. It also relates to the approach I take as aneditor, which is directly related to my creative practiceand my experience of living in the world with a humanbody, its form, and its vulnerabilities. Both are artist-ledprojects and both have been a home base for me becauseof a common ethos of curiosity. As an editor, the authorstake the lead and my role is to listen and reflect back andhelp them articulate their ideas in their own unique way.What First Rule of CI?There have been several articles about Contact Improvisa-tion in recent CQs with prominent references to the FirstRule of Contact Improvisation,* most recently How theFirst Rule Brought #MeToo to Contact Improvisation byMichele Beaulieux, CQ Vol. 44.1, Winter/Spring 2019, aswell as Martin Keogh's mention of it in previous CQ articlesand now his book, Dancing Deeper Still. In each case, I havewanted to pipe up to either edit these mentions or footnotethem with my own opinion, but I resisted, as it felt like aninappropriate use of my editorial power with CQ. It isonly now that I have finally taken the time and page spaceto respond. [N.S.S.]*From Richard Kim's blog post: Rules: It's called the FirstRule of CI, or the Only Rule, or...maybe the FundamentalPrinciple. Its shorthand version is 'take care of yourself,' butI've heard it expressed as, 'Above all else, you are responsiblefor yourself.'In my experience as a member of the first grouppracticing Contact Improvisation with Steve Paxton in1972, the original training for Contact and the foundationfor the early years of its development encouraged both anawareness of our own limits and (mostly physical) safety,and, an awareness of those around us. This emphasis onawareness and safety for all continues to be at the founda-tion of my own practice and teaching of CI. The idea oftaking care of yourself--in other words, of dancing withawareness so as to work within your limits (howeverdrawing by Neca Zarvosyou perceive them)--was never a call to be only, or evenprimarily, concerned with one's own safety and well-being.We were always looking out for each other.It seems that perhaps the telephone game phenom-enon is at work here. Apparently some people who heardthe initial suggestion in early CI classes to take care ofyourself and those around you (through the use of periph-eral vision, etc.) were so happy to be given permission toprioritize taking care of themselves that the second half ofthat suggestion/principle withered on the vine. Eventually,it seems, the suggestion was further reduced to take careof yourself first (and foremost) and achieved First Rule ofCI status. Ouch! This hurts me every time I hear it.I wonder when this term first rule emerged. Itcertainly was not there in the first years of CI. Therewere no explicit rules as far as I remember--only anatmosphere and practice of encouraging mutual safety,support, and discovery. (And the suggestion to put onefoot back when catching a hurtling body so you couldspiral on the way down and not just be knocked over.)When I recently brought up this first rule phenome-non with first generation CI dancer Nita Little, she wasstunned and said she had never heard the term before.So I think it's fair to say that this construction is a morerecent invention. It was not there from the beginning,as is regularly implied in exchanges on social media andin writing that I've seen. Exactly when it began, I don'tknow. Although it seems pervasive now among many CIpractitioners and communities, I think it might be usefulfor CI researchers, teachers, and practitioners to knowthat it was not part of the foundation of the work.The phenomenon of this kind of reduction ofvalues, intentions, and suggestions into inaccurate andall-too-solid dogmas and rules is a compelling, albeitdisconcerting, study.I am grateful to feel the current questioning anddiscussion concerning this important but apparentlymisunderstood, misnamed, and misused principle: whichwas, and is, for me always about taking care to dance insuch a way as to not injure yourself or others.I set out to construct a timeline of my involvement withcontact improvisation and Contact Quarterly and was,needless to say, extremely grateful to own an almostcomplete set of back issues--because at my advanced age,I discover that though I can recall places and dates, I amlosing my memory for names. Herewith, what I was ableto pull together:1975: A fledgling dance critic for the Canadian Broadcast-ing Corporation, I'm invited to show up at the VancouverOpera Association for what turns out to be Steve Paxtonand Nancy Stark Smith's first performance of ContactImprovisation in Vancouver, BC. This encounter utterlyupends my sense of what dance might be.1977: I enroll in workshops at Vancouver's Western Front,where I study CI with members of ReUnion (Steve, Nancy,Nita Little, and Curt Siddall), and Mangrove (Curt, ByronBrown, John LeFan, and James Tyler). My first effort atwriting about Contact, broadcast on the CBC in June, istranscribed and reprinted in an early issue of the ContactNewsletter. Later, I travel to Berkeley for the July Projectin the Moving Arts, an intensive involvement with Curt,James, Terry Sendgraff, and Ruth Zaporah.1979: Having moved back to New York and taken a jobrunning the American Dance Guild, I use my vacation toreturn to Vancouver for Current Exchange, a gathering ofexperienced contactors led by Steve and including a veryyoung Stephen Petronio. He heads for New York and a jobas the first male in the Trisha Brown Dance Company.The idea emerges to make improvisation the focus ofthe Guild's next annual meeting...1980...to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in June,with Steve as the keynote speaker; Anna Halprin as theguest of honor; and practically every contact dancer onthe continent involved in a teaching capacity. We call itDance as Art Sport, after a remark by Simone Forti.1982: In a CI class in Manhattan, I tumble off Petronio'sback and bruise my coccyx, convincing myself that it'stime to let this practice go. But by then I've been draftedonto the board of Contact Collaborations, Inc.; I find,tucked in with the back issues, copies of minutes ofboard meetings and a draft book proposal for a fieldguide to contact improvisation, which never material-ized; Cynthia Novack's 1990 Sharing the Dance and other,later treatises--and of course, CQ itself--filled this need.)Novack died in 1996. As I page through my hugecollection of back issues, I become aware of how many ofour colleagues are gone, including James Tyler, my collegeclassmate; dancer and teacher Nancy Topf; choreographerTrisha Brown; and countless dancers and writers whowrote to and in CQ. I was rarely one of those writers, asmy economic situation made it necessary to be paid formy work.From its photocopied beginnings, the magazine grewthicker, fancier, less frequent, but has always been full ofinvaluable material from across the world. Now, in 2019,we bid farewell to this print edition of CQ, as we have toso many other publications. Though I love paging throughold paper copies, digital materials are much more easilysearchable and more widely, quickly, and inexpensivelydistributed. CQ is dead; long live CQ--and the generationsof thinkers, doers, and writers who've contributed to thisunique chronicle.With thanks to Nancy, Lisa Nelson, Steve, and all the restof the crew,In celebration of the digital adventure--CQ becomesaccessible? It is really a new adventure to try and promoteCQ to new readers.Touchdown Dance (TD), a unique company foundedin 1986 at Dartington College in Devon, UK, by Steve Paxtonand Anne Kilcoyne, grew from an idea of Steve's to bringtogether visually impaired and sighted people in theContact Improvisation (CI) experience. It appeared that atouch-based movement method would be of use to touch-based navigators in the world, and an accessible means tobring diverse bodies together. Something extraordinary isseeded by the very idea of CI, and new movement evolves,shapes itself into form spontaneously--like a choreographyof presence, of pause in motion. TD grew into a ground-breaking experience that people travel far and wide to do.Steve and Anne's article on TD [Common Sense]was one of a wave of initiatives that were written about forthe first time in a substantial way in CQ in your Dancingwith Different Populations issue in 1992 [CQ Vol. 17.1].The world of somatic practices, improvised scores, andCI-based methods have been the foundation to Touchdown'sperformances since 1992. Currently, Touchdown Dancehas three visually impaired and two sighted dancersmaking work, dancing CI, and improvising whilst teach-ing around the UK and internationally. We created aneducation pack in which the CI methods and legacy ofSteve and Anne are relayed in word and image to informcommunity and education settings in which we work.We are avid readers and supporters of CQ--and feelrelieved, as it goes digital, that it will be more accessibleto screen reader software and saving trees!!Katy Dymoke; Manchester, UKArtistic director, Touchdown Dance (since 1994)Dear CQ,The transference of movement information through theglobal contact improvisation community--an example:We were fortunate to have a copy of Contact Quarterly,Summer/Fall 2000 (Vol. 25.2), passed on from an elderteacher who had two copies--shared with her keenand developing CI dancer friends in Newcastle, a smallContact community three hours north of Sydney.The article Spacewalk--Reflections on Nancy Topf'sSpacewalk Improvisation was read and reflected on. Howtragically this woman died and yet how wonderful thatshe lives on through her work then and now. Excerptswere read to our dance improvisation collective, andthe exercise interpreted and performed. So playful anddynamic. Thanks, Nancy. And thanks Contact Quarterly.Definitely a journal for moving ideas!Even though it is only the paper version of CQ we aresaying goodbye to, it is still a heart-wrenching goodbyeto the physical, holdable, lie-on-your-bedside-table-able,put-in-your-bag-able, loanable, savorable version of themagazine that has given me, for forty-odd years, a greatbeing to belong to, whose wise, laughing, listening, andloving arms reach around the globe.Even though the online version thrives, lives on,goes out even farther and wider than the beloved paperone, I feel a loss, and a need to express my gratitude forall the years and all the labor that went into making it,sacrificing personal creative time for the benefit of thecollective.Nancy and Lisa, Melinda and all the fabulousassistant and guest editors, designers, and staff over theyears, you have been for me the roots of a magnificent tree,nourishing all of us who wanted to exchange our stories,news, and ideas, add our leaf, our flower, our pine coneloaded with winged seeds, in hopes that the winds mightcarry our feelings far. You gave us access to those winds,lifting us all into the sky on such far-reaching branches,giving all that such great beings give: inspiration, nourish-ment, shelter in the storm, and the very air we breathe. Iam a leaf on that tree, and there is not even a way for meto imagine my life without you.At the Somatics Festival 2019 in Northampton, MA, inSeptember--celebrating the work of Janet Adler, BonnieBainbridge Cohen, Nancy Stark Smith, and the 45-yearHeritage of Contact Quarterly--I sat on a panel titledArchiving the Experience of the Body in Motion withseveral distinguished archive curators.As editor of Currents Journal of the Body-MindCentering Association and Lost & Found: The CUNYPoetics Document Initiative, I felt ready to speak tobeing immersed in people's archives--my grandmother'sbuttons, my father's papers, and, later, the NYC municipalarchives in search of archaeological sites. But it wasn'tuntil I studied Body-Mind Centering that I was able toaccount for my own body and dig back to my earliesttraining, the Rhythms Fundamentals (of Ruth Doing)--a vital, but rare artifact of the American PhysicalCulture Movement.During the panel's closing, Nancy Stark Smithasked how to create an archive that was active, how totranslate experience into language and then open it backinto experience. I get it--the dancer's archive interlopeswith the reader/mover by matter of both light (film) andlanguage (scores, writings, techniques), but dance iscommunal; therefore, even the soloist is derivative from aprevious form or technique. Example: I am currently cata-loguing Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's papers (1970-present)bound for their archival home. But does the founder's workstand alone? At this panel, Cohen said, This work wascreated in community. She wonders how to house a50-year dialogue that evolved Body-Mind Centering?Librarians and academics must take into account thenature of the bodies of the archive. It becomes a place thatstrikes us in situ and in choir. The archive is an emotionaland tactile experience not unlike the contact improvisa-tion-feeling of profundity of weight, matter, and current(flow). As Nancy put it, the translation of the languageback into experience, and, in Bonnie's words, the work...in community. I call it summoning the interface.Shall we enter the bodies of the archive from theperspective of the mover as well as the language of themovement? Finally, there ought to be a way to fashion amover's papers with enough interface as to allow forour touch.Kate Tarlow Morgan, MA, RSME;Marlboro, VermontI'm mourning the last of CQ's classy print periodicals.Congratulations and best wishes for CQ Unbound (greatname!). With gratitude and love,Aileen Crow was a beloved teacher and prolific somaticresearcher who combined her study and practice of manytechniques and philosophies of movement, creativity, andhealing to transform the lives of her students, colleagues,and anyone who came in contact with her and her work.A Laban Movement Analyst, teacher of the AlexanderTechnique since 1969, and practitioner of Neuro-Linguis-tic Programming, Aileen brought together AuthenticMovement, Mindell's Dreambody Process Work, and amultitude of other bodywork, therapeutic, movement,and creative disciplines to guide people into movement,creativity, and wellness.Her clear writings, playful character drawings,and illuminating insights contributed lucid, embodiedresearch to Contact Quarterly.Paula Sager, cofounding editor of A Moving Journal,writes, Aileen had an eye for rogue movement patterns--the odder the better--and an ear for the unspoken word,the invisible sound. She had a nose for the best of eachmodality she mastered and an unparallel appetite forunfolding process. She was a big-hearted, rebel-mindedcontributing editor for A Moving Journal, engaging con-tinuous, dynamic research and dialogue in the field ofAuthentic Movement.Aileen lived in New City, NY, and was 93 whenshe passed away on April 13, 2019. In additionto CQ's back issues (searchable on our website),Aileen's writings Janis Claxton--an Australian dancer based in Bristol,UK, and then Edinburgh, Scotland--began her artisticand teaching practice with the health and wellness of thebody. Her work shows how art is health and health is artand that art should be enlivening, nourishing, and healing.Her key ideas about relating in contact improvisation wereanchored in a keen sense of somatic health, informed byher deep understanding of the Erick Hawkins work.In leading contact improvisation workshops suchas Dancing in and out of Contact and Returning Hometo the Body, Janis emphasized self-sensing, internalphysics in relation to environment, and detailed alignmentto facilitate students' precise, expressive, and highlytuned dancing. She was highly perceptive and insightfulwith regard to stuck points in one's dancing. Whileworkshopping a skill having to do with partnering, shewould often stop and take us to the floor or to the wallto investigate our own patterning. Working on patternsto release and align the body led to openings and under-standings in the physical, emotional, and mindful aspectsof dancing--often leading to a deeper sense of creativityand self knowledge. Janis was a powerful teacher whocould quickly bring students to their inner truths andto the heart of the matter.Erick Hawkins was a profound inspiration for Janis,and she credits him with the initiation of somatic investiga-tion in the field of modern dance. Janis herself was a tirelessadvocate for healthy dance practice, somatic intelligence,and women in dance. She was strongly critical of thetrends toward extreme bodies in performance. In ourlast conversation, she was enthusiastically checking myfeminist outlook, sharpening my critical thinking, andsharing her amazing energy and insight! I am so gratefulfor her work, artistry, making, and teaching.Tamara Ashley, UKRobin MacRostieApril 16, 1945-September 29, 2019An active and beloved member of the Western Massachusettsarts community, Robin MacRostie brought her creativespirit and passion for dance to everything she did.

Thank youfor your support, your leadership, and your commitment tomaking connections. With love.NoiseI've been thinking about the idea of ambiguity. SometimesI call it abstraction. Sometimes it is the unknown, orobscurity. I would like to start with the idea that thingsaround us are mostly ambiguous. What we see and under-stand clearly--articulated ideas, clear shapes of furniture,harmonized objects, sharp edges of architecture, and soon--are more or less rare. Of course, we constantly striveto seek out harmony, connection, order, agreement, clarity,shape, and the tangible...at least, I find myself seekingsome type of definition for things and ideas.We are social beings, living in society with others. Theseharmonized objects and ideas are also how we communi-cate with each other. Language, for example, as a symbolicmethod of communication, is a product of that bent towardharmony and connection. A traffic light is created for allthe cars to be regulated and in order on the streets.Still, I am fascinated with non-harmonized, abstracted,noise-like things. Things that exist around those harmo-nies, things that are usually dismissed, things that arealways taken for granted, things that are situated innegative space, things that are mundane or even invisible.When sidony o'neal--one of the dancers in Direct Path toDetour (whose individual interdisciplinary practice spansexperimental sound, sculpture, drawing, performance,and writing)--and I worked on a short improvisationalperformance together a few years back, I shared MichelSerres's text on noise.2 I still remember sidony's response,which was to point out the importance of imbalance anddiscord as reminders of every noise that we are not able tohear or that we've been hearing too much of.I do admit that I usually get satisfaction from harmonizedthings. They give me a sense of understanding, of provingthat I communicated clearly, of security...but if I give moreattention to the noises (some people might call them whitenoise), those harmonized things can acquire a renewedmeaning.As I am writing this, I realize how Buddhist this approachcould seem. Maybe I am a Buddhist. Maybe I am beingJapanese. Maybe I am just being Taka. Whatever.Even in this technology/Internet-centric society, whereI am used to easy access to seeing and understanding,I can't look up noises or abstracted ideas online. I like itthat way. Once a noise is defined, it loses its core quality.Noise needs to be perceived with awareness and a willing-ness to surrender. Noise can be interpreted only with time,because noise transforms and changes moment to moment.Noise is something to experience, not to understandintellectually.Harmony and agreement are rare, but also inevitable. Inthis current society, we live with harmony, agreement, andmeaning as much as with chaos and noise. In observingnoise, I want to be open to the effects that harmony andmeaning have on us.Continually being thrown off balance is another thing;if a state of complete balance is harmony, then I seek tokeep this harmony constantly dissipating only so thatit can be harmonized or balanced again. Maybe we candeliberately access harmony for a moment but bypassit toward something else? So that we never dwell inharmony or meaning?I am making a correlation between the concept of noiseand abstraction. In the midst of making Direct Path toDetour, I started to lose the distinction between those twoconcepts. Maybe as I move forward with my practice, I'llrealize the distinction or confuse myself more and more.Either way, this project has been driving me forward.ObservationI believe that art--both ephemeral/experiential formslike live performance and object/image-based work thatviewers can contemplate at their own pace--has a powerto engage with meanings and ideas. I am thinking beyondthe argument about art as mere self-expression or acciden-tal self-expression--that engagement with meaningscan happen in various forms, such as creating, exposing/revealing, defying, denying, investigating, observing,criticizing, and playing with.As a maker, I enjoy using my artistic practice to observean idea or a concept that I'm curious about. Maybe I findmeanings from the act of observing. Curiosity drives mypractice; I observe how I, as a performer, feel/think/do inrelationship to the task that I give myself in front of theviewers (observers).I find that I often resonate with liberal and progressivethinking in contemporary American society. As I learnmore and more, I realize that I am a pure product of capital-ism and neoliberalism. Maybe that has something to dowith the fact that I grew up in Japanese society, which hasbeen ideologically driven by capitalistic ideals, especiallysince World War II. I get fulfillment out of working hard,challenging myself, and accomplishing the goals that I setfor myself. In addition to this social factor, my parents areextremely driven people, continuously encouraging meand my siblings to act on things rather than to wait forsomething to come about. Of course, as an artist, I don'tmake a lot of money (which defies that capitalistic ideal),but I notice that I find pleasure in productivity and instriving for something bigger than myself or beyond whereI am at the moment. It seems that an investment in thepractice of observing resists these neoliberal habits thathave been ingrained in me.In 2004, I studied with theatre artist Mary Overlie,who, through the teaching of her Viewpoints method,states that she values being an observer/participantas opposed to a creator/originator when she makeswork or performs. It took me a while to understand whatthat means to me. When I started making my own workin 2009, I began to appreciate that way of thinking andaspired to embody that concept.From 2010 to 2014, I had an opportunity to learn intimatelyabout the late Japanese nature photographer-essayistMichio Hoshino. With an invitation from director LeonIngulsrud (from SITI company), I was lucky enough toresearch and play the role of Michio in PerseveranceTheatre Company's original production of The Blue Bearin Juneau, Alaska. One token of his candid yet profoundlifelong contemplation is the idea that humans are just amere part of nature, which criticizes the assumed divisionbetween nature and civilization. His philosophy alsospeaks to the cycle of lives--paraphrasing from the scriptof the play if I may--from plankton to herrings, herringsto whales, whales to fishes, fishes to bears, bears to trees,then trees to plankton. Circle of life. And he states thatwe, as humans, are part of this circle. His ideas comefrom his experience of spending much time in nature--observing living things with great patience, tenacity,curiosity, and obsession.I believe that Mary Overlie and Michio Hoshino have hada big influence on my way of observing.What this observing does for me, especially when doneduring live performance, is to put a gentle brake on mycoiled-up, goal-oriented modus operandi. In this technol-ogy/Internet-centric society, I find myself bored right awaywhen I don't have access to understanding at my fingertips,in a second. But this quality of observing requires perceiv-ing at a slower speed, allowing me to be with the present(what I feel physically, what I think at that moment, whatI see) rather than being preoccupied with the future(reaching toward where I want to go or what I want toaccomplish). I admit that as a choreographer, sometimescreating a product takes priority over an awareness of timeitself, but I get a high from trying not to strive for the veryephemeral minutes or hours of performing. This is alsowhat I feel and value when I view performances.Yes, live performance always involves an audience/viewers.Although I sometimes deliberately face the viewers, impli-cating their gaze in my performative action and invitingthem to be part of the event, I have been learning that thisobservation-oriented performance that I'm interested inhas a tendency to be all about the performers (myself),thus alienating the viewers' experience. So, in thinkingabout viewership as a vital part of this phenomenologicalevent called live performance, I want to put as much consi-deration into how viewers engage as with what's beingpresented. What does this observation in performancedo to the viewers as they go on a ride with the presentedexperience, create meaning and narratives, and invest inwhat they see? What kind of experience shall I invite theviewers to travel through?I don't know the answers to those questions. I probablywon't know the answers for a while, or ever. But thischallenge of holding both my value of observation inperformance and the viewers' experience in parallelfuels me in the making process.Drew Klein, performing arts director at the ContemporaryArts Center in Cincinnati, has spoken about Direct Path toDetour in relationship to the idea of protest. As much as Iappreciate his perspective, I told him that I see the themeof this project to be more in line with resistance.I would like us, the performers, to observe while perform-ing. That is important for me. What if observation can be aform of resistance?The observation of noise. The observation of the non-understandable. Even if it is just pure attempt, is thatcompromise? If we find ourselves, in a society, confrontedwith varying and sometimes contradictory sets of valuesystems, would it be possible to observe that in-between-ness without taking a side, without arriving at harmonyor order? Could we live in the noise? Could we perceiveourselves and others as mere noise for a second, encom-passing a greater whole? Could we be abstract together?At this point, the question becomes, Then what? Whatfollows observation? The dramaturge Lu Yim pointed thisout to me during the production. Again, I don't have theanswer at this moment. Intentionality of observation, orembodiment of the observed/observing states might havesomething to do with it, but I can't articulate that, yet.I stood before the crown of the saint who foundedHungary.

The exhibition was dedicated to the inner experiences of the dancers, invitingthe audience to nap, meditate-while-standing (aka small dance), and every Sunday to practiceContact Improvisation in a studio we had carved out within the walls of the museum. It alsopresented videos of Steve's early pieces from the Judson era, Grand Union performances, andContact Improvisation, as well as installations based on Material for the Spine, a wall of thecomplete back issues of Contact Quarterly, and videos of Steve performing the GoldbergVariations, PA RT, and many other solo and group works.That evening, Jurij Konjar restaged Satisfyin Lover, a piece Steve made in 1968 for 42ordinary people to cross the stage and sit, walk, or stand; and FLAT, a solo from 1964. Jurij alsoimprovised to J.S. Bach's The Goldberg Variations interpreted by Glenn Gould, inspired by a solothat Steve performed from 1986 to 1992.The next day, Steve gave a two-hour talk in Culturgest's grand auditorium at the invitationof Liliana Courtinho (Talks Curator for Culturgest). What follows is excerpted from his talk.Steve Paxton. Well...[bringinghis chair to the edge of the stage, lookingat the audience].So here you are. Against allobstacles, here you are.How did you do it?When I think of an audienceand the man-hours that it takes toprepare to go out and sit in a theatre--all the arrangements that it takes,the scheduling, the calendars, thebaby-sitters, the shopping, theclothes--the clothes alone must takehours and hours.Just give them their weight.I wanted to speak today withyoung dancers, if they came.Just to say, first of all, that theroute to becoming a dancer is a longone. And this is because you have togrow the information: you don't getthe information; what you get is aten-year course, in which you haveto change your body; you have toactually develop, grow, direct yourown growth and be directed by yourteachers into a different body.The reason for this is that thedances we [Western dancers] dancework with projection, or extension,or stretch, or pointing--the extremesof the geometry of the body. I don'tknow why we've done that, exceptthat for a theatre like the one we arein right now--I could make intimategestures here on stage that might notcarry to the top row. Maybe that's thecase, maybe as theatres got bigger,the dance became grander. But, atany rate, it seems we have inventedsomething that no other dance hadever done. It is quite an invention.What does it mean to have aninvention in movement? In humangrowth? In the development of whatwe become? I don't know if I cananswer this question.Each culture invents its art,and we don't know exactly the rulesbehind that. We know what we'vedone. We can see it. We've heardabout it. For instance, the story ofmodern dance coming to counter thepower of ballet. Or so I was told, eventhough I don't think it's really true.I mean modern dance was as muchdependent on ballet as Lisbon isdependent on Ancient Greece: itwas a basis. And yet, with the moderndance came a new idea, the idea thatit didn't have to be a universal dance,that it could be a personal dance.When it came to my generation, Iassessed the situation this way: myteacher, Merce Cunningham, did notdo what he was taught, he went on tofind a new thing to do; his teacher,Martha Graham, did not do what shewas taught, she found, or she inventeda new way to do it; her teachers, RuthSt Denis and Ted Shawn, did not dowhat their idol, Isadora Duncan, haddone; and Isadora did not do whatanybody had done.This is a very interestingsequence, and it happened in all themodern arts. It meant that therewas a lot of responsibility on partlytrained, immature, aspiring, hopefulartists to invent something new asthey were developing, as they werestill being developed by their teach-ers. In a way, their resistance had tobe grown at the same time, so theydid not simply become a copy of whatthey were taught. This responsibilityis that they had to become like thephoenix, coming out of the ashesof the previous art forms. But itcouldn't be the same phoenix: anew bird had to come.So that was weird. That's thesituation we were in. That's why Idon't encourage anyone to be a dancer,because this is going to be a hardclimb. But if you do, just know thatit's going to take you a long time tomature, and you have to be patientwith yourself, and you will have togo to these classes. You don't haveto like a class, you have to go to itregularly to get your body strong.Plus, that will be a basis for yourhealth for the rest of your life--so, you know--why not?Now, is there something outthere to find? Have we found it all?Doesn't it feel like that? There are somany people and they are so different.Well, where I live--I live ona farm--there is a kitchen with awindow facing south onto a gentlehill and a tree. In the spring, grassgrows there, the tree has blossoms.In the winter, it is snow--we're veryfar north in Vermont--and the treesare bare. Naked, cold trees. And Ilook out everyday, and I feel some-thing. I have been there for fiftyyears, looking out this window, moreor less. I feel something, and what Ifeel is the molecules of that hillside.After all this time, my vision--not myactual eyes--my vision is saying: thisplace is alive. Every bit of it is alive.The dirt is alive. The plants are alive.Every molecule is transforming intosomething else. They get to a certainpoint, they start to decay, they trans-form to something else, they comeup again, the cycle is happening, it'smolecular. I'm seeing it on a molecu-lar level. These molecules are not setin stones. These molecules are adapt-ing and changing. A trillion changesare happening at any one time in myyard. And they're not all happeningin the same way that they've alreadyhappened. The changes are adapting,they are adapting a little bit intosomething else.I'm talking about evolution, ina way; I'm talking about evolutionin miniature, I'm talking about ouratoms, our molecules, changing.We know they do, we know they'vechanged, even though you feel thesame, even though I feel the same, asme, as you, you know you've changed.You are not who you used to be. Norwill you stay who you are now.This is so scary: what am I aboutto say next? I don't know.But, what I have said so far seemsto suggest that you have some abilityto guide what you become as youchange. The change is going to happen.You have a choice. If you want to be adancer, you do the classes. I suggestyou do the classes. You don't haveto. I know one dancer, Simone Forti,who didn't do the classes, but sheis such a genius. I used to see herin Cunningham classes. She wastrying to do the classes, and afterthe classes I would see her on herhands and knees, crawling. I knewthat she needed one more thing,something simple and straightfor-ward, something basic to groundherself again. She is somebody thattasted the dance techniques but wasnot adapted, or compliant enough;too stubborn, maybe. And that's howshe went on developing her own workand ended up at a place that I wouldconsider shamanistic.It's altogether a rather strangething to do, to take a body and to turnit into an art thing. It's one thing tomake art of bodies, of people fighting,of lovers twisting--to make a pictureof it. But to do art with it, what astrange thing. And dance is particu-larly strange because movement is sohard to understand and to describe.I think that's the reason why indance techniques they simplify it, sowhen you study a dance technique,you are studying a small area of whatmovement can be. And if you are thento study martial arts, or Tai Chi, orfolk dance, you have then a differentslice of human movement. What Isaw in Bali, nothing of my dancewas there to be seen.So is there more? I think moreis evolving. I think we are evolving.I think you have to evolve. There's allkinds of evolution. There's what youdo in your life by yourself, as a soloevolver--that's your work. There'syou and your friends, a group of you,how you think, what you think, whatyou agree on, how you present workmaybe. There's the larger culture,gradually moving on. We are allevolving.Now I would like to show a fewvideos that appear in the exhibition.And the first I want to show is Smiling,a dance I made to reflect on facialexpressions in contemporary cultures.In Rome, in 1969, the piece was pre-sented with State, a dance wherepeople stood still, and Satisfyin Lover,a dance which you saw yesterday,where people walk, stand, and sit.I wanted to see what these looklike on stage, I wanted to see theseperformed, I wanted to see standingperformed, not just to happen. Iwanted to see it performed to honorit, but also to see what would happento people doing it. To walk naturally,which is what they are supposed to doin Satisfyin Lover, is not easily done.When I settled upon walking asan artistic formula or medium, I waslooking for something ancient in thebody, I was looking for somethingnot of the culture, but before culture,back to times we could only imagine,and I think walking was a good choice.It's an obvious thing, we do it all thetime. To put it on the stage is whatour culture does: a microscope onwalking, on the people who are walk-ing, on the fact of walking, standing,and sitting. Just as one strata of whatthe body does.I am sure you all know that to bebipedal, to be walking standing uplike this, is not the most normal wayof moving on the Earth and relatingto gravity. It gives us the potentialof using the arms in various ways,but it is unusual. The uprightnessallows for the head to be at the top ofthe body, which means that there isabout seven pounds of mass up there.Playing with that point of balancearound which we are switching sides,head to torso, changing the wayweight falls through the body, andsuddenly we are in ballet, suddenlywe are in Java....I have written a little bookcalled Gravity 1. The reason gravityis important to me as a thoughtform is that gravity is what keepsthe body true. And by true I meanin the sense of carpentry: the fall ofa weight on a string makes its linestraight. The fall of our weight in thebody has the same effect. The fall ofthe organs into the pelvis helps giveus a basis. We can unnecessarily pullthose organs back up and hold theweight high--into a kind of paralysis.But we can also let them fall. In thatcase, it is as though our freedomwas based on our acceptance of itsopposite.Evolution takes a long time andhappens in small elements.For young dancers, despair not.We modestly say: we have only begunto understand, we may not have evenbegun yet. There's lots of chaos andevolution that we have yet to find andsomebody in this room, somebody inthis city, has such potential of devel-opment that they can bring and showus something else.I think that's all I have to say.Thank you for coming.Oh, yes, there's a possibility forquestions.Liliana Courtinho. In one ofthe videos of the exhibition [... in anon-wimpy way... an interview withSteve by Bojana Cvejic and LennartLaberenz], you are in your dancestudio in your farm in NorthernVermont and you say, This is whereI cultivate my pessimism. And so Iwondered: today, you seemed quiteoptimistic. Where do you stand now,between those two options?Steve Paxton. I thought I wasan optimist for many years, but I meta man in Amsterdam, in an interviewsituation, and he asked me a questionthat I thought was so stupid, somethingalong the lines of don't you thinkthings are getting better? At thatpoint, I was much younger than Iam now, but I was already at an agewhere I could say: I know things arejust not getting better, and I don'tknow what to do about it. So I saidto him, No, I don't things are gettingbetter. What about the police, whatabout education, what about nurses,where have you been? Have you beenunder a rock all your life?I realized at that moment thatI was very pessimistic. This wassaddening to me. But I also realized:well, being an optimist doesn't seemto have worked, it doesn't seem tohave helped improve anything; I havebeen told that it's a good thing butwho knows? And so I tried to be apessimist and see how that worked,or see what its conditions were. I havebeen living under these conditionsnow for some time. It's a bitter victory.It's somehow a little bit healthier tohope that things will improve than tohave the bitter confirmation that youare right, that they will not improve.But I'm waiting for the next turn:if I changed once, I am sure I canchange again, if I can find evidencethat something is improving. So:stay tuned.Vera Mantero. Steve, you spenta lot of time in your life buildingand devising very complex, andsometimes mysterious, systems toimprovise. Why is it important foryou to improvise and to createconditions, complicated conditions,to improvise? And I am not thinkinghere about Contact Improvisation,I'm thinking for example of the workyou did with Lisa Nelson, [Nightstand],in which you were exchanging variouskinds of objects; I'm thinking ofsystems that you built in order todo something that you don't knowat first what it's going to be?Steve Paxton. Well, first let metell you that this whole talk was, asI think is pretty clear, an improvi-sation. I worried about it, I thoughtabout it, I was impressed by the factit was going to happen, and that Ishould prepare properly to meetpeople who had come to seriouslylisten, but I didn't set it. It isn't thatI don't care. I hope I have deliveredsomething of substance. But I feelthat those things that can sponta-neously arise when we're together--have more to do with a grace in theroom than with anything I am goingto deliver.So this question of improvisation:I think if you start to improvise, ifyou start to inquire about improvisa-tion, you will end up as I did, askingyourself: I would like to know whatimprovisation is. Of course it is notpossible to not ask this question,but the minute you do that, you areset back for a good couple of years.Instead, I think what you need to dois to look to your life, to look for thoselittle moments when maybe you canobserve yourself without noticingthat you are, and notice that you areimprovising all the time. You justare, you can't stop it, it's part ofeverything you do.You simply don't have enoughconsciousness power to manufac-ture all the events that you create.Consciousness is like the finger here[moving his index inside of his glass],thinking: hmm, what is this glass?What is this water? Hmm, interesting.Consciousness. Meanwhile, all of this[pointing to the rest of his body andaround him], the rest of me, is theunconscious making the conditionsfor this moment to happen, and letthis finger have its way in what it'sinterested in.So, improvisation: how do you dosomething that you don't know youare about to do? I think we shouldeliminate any idea of freedom fromthis discussion. There is no suchthing as freedom, there are alwaysconditions. You may disagree, butif we are dealing with conditions, itmeans we are dealing with things weare not consciously dictating. Thisis what we are doing all the time:coping with situations reflexively,or unthinkingly, or else exploring. Ihaven't decided yet what I am aboutto do and as I am beginning to do it,at some point I am going to make achoice [extending his arms]: how did Iget here? That's short enough that wecould examine it.But if we'd get into a long JurijKonjar improvisation [to the GoldbergVariations], like last night... It startsoff, and you get it for a while, and youcan still track it, but then you get lostin the complexity of the doing, anditjust goes on and on and you end upwith something that is a mountainof detail, that you have somehowabsorbed. For those of you who didn'tsee it yesterday, let me just say that itwas incredibly articulate and intricate.The body was coming apart and goingtogether in so many different waysso fast sometimes that you could nottrack, you could not see where themovement was going to emerge next.What directions he was going to gointo. A complexity. And that wasan hour.I have a friend--Lisa Nelson.She recently did a performance,[End Plays, with Hijack, in NewYork], in which the formula for theperformance was: one person makesa proposal and then says when theproposal stops, then the other per-son makes a proposal and then sayswhen it stops. Three people wereultimately doing this, probably mak-ing a hundred and fifty proposals inan hour, and in that time, the wholestage was transformed. I mean lit-erally transformed: the tables wereupside down, the chairs were moved,the dancers had been everywhereon the stage--and yet they were justgoing through this little formula.Gradually, from that formula, it gotto be an accumulation of detail, likeevolution of life on Earth leading tosomething as particular and outra-geous as [the Australian] Peacockspider--something that whollytransformed the situation. I felt like Ihad taken a mushroom: my thoughtprocess was recognizably hallucinat-ing--from a performance!I felt a little bit like that in theperformance last night as well. Iremember trying to keep hold of onemoment which was so beautiful, andit kept changing, and then anotherremarkable moment happened. Whathad happened in between? Well, itwas too complex to know exactly, andI was straining to recover a reality thatI had just lived through. It is quite astate. A place of ambiguity and lackof anchoring.It works if you care. And Jurijmade me care. I have danced thatdance. I know that dance. I mean, notthat dance--we could have a discus-sion here. That was his dance. But heknows my dance, so somehow it isour dance, to a degree. The questionof authorship of this dance has nowlost all rationality. We have beentalking for four or five years nowabout how is he supposed to relateto the fact that he is doing a danceI did, and yet he is doing his dance.How does he do it?Such an interesting question:how does one decide...? I think it'ssomething about play. You know howit is, you decide, Oh let's take the dayoff, and let's go to the beach, or let'sgo down to the park and run in thegrass. I think it's something aboutplay, and it is a decision we can take.If you go to a studio and you play andyou are serious enough to track whatyou are doing.If you want to improvise, youhave to be aware of the fact thateverything is evolving, nothing isset--set meaning stopped, set mean-ing undeveloped-beyond, which isnot how life seems to work. And yet,it seems to be how culture works.Culture is past-viewing. I mean, whatelse could be agreed upon? You can'tget a million people to agree on thefuture. But you can get most of themto agree on a certain version of thepast, and that becomes the culture,and the artists of that culture arethose who are remembered, and stufflike this museum show of my work isproduced. It's the culture looking atitself and deciding what are themerits of something: Miró,Gauguin, Picasso.Improvisation. I think it issomething you can train yourselfto do, and look for the conditionswith which you want to do it. Andwe also have to recognize that thereare some things for which planningand order and sequencing are betterthan improvisation for achieving. Forinstance: don't improvise your taxes.Anonymous: I am not really adancer. I don't have a dancing back-ground established. I wonder: is therea difference between movement anddance? What did your experience,Steve Paxton: Well I can saythis: I am perfectly willing to eliminatethe word dance from language ifit would help clarify matters. I don'tthink we can do without the wordmovement. But I think we could getalong without the word dance.How the word dance is usefulis when people are trying to expressthe state or the change of state thatten years of study, and the focus on acertain aesthetic, produces in a body.Maybe in my mind I call it adance because of the perspectivethat I have. And if that's a perspectivethat others don't have, I am willing togive up the fight. All I want to do is toexpand the extent of consciousness. Iknow that the brain has many priori-ties, and that our casual movement isnot part of its high priorities. I knowthat with walking, especially if youare walking and thinking about what'son your list, the mechanism of howyou are getting yourself to whereyou are going is not a priority. That'swhat got me wondering: how doesmy body do it? How does it get mearound? What is the support systemto which I don't ever give a holiday?Sure, sometimes I take it out to eat,give it a good dinner. But still, thatunacknowledged thing that we haveto support the me that you thinkyou are, I think of that as a dance.And if I think of that as a dance, Ican think of the minutia of thatsmall dance, of those tiniest littlemovements.uTo read the full transcript ofSteve's talk, go to CQ Unboundon www.contactquarterly.comFor more information on the exhibition,you can obtain the catalogue, StevePaxton: Drafting Interior Techniques,available on booksonthemove.eu. Theexhibition will be travelling to AzkunaCentroa in Bilbao, Spain, from FebruaryAt the invitation of choreographer/curator Meg Stuart, I created a six-part text for Tanzkongress 2019held June 5-10 at the Festspielhaus Hellerau, in Dresden, Germany. TK2019, subtitled A Long LastingAffair, offered a communal and praxis-based approach to contemporary questions in dance. TK2019 receivedsignificant funding from the German Federal Cultural Foundation and included workshops and creativepropositions to 600 participants.Excerpted here are three sections from the text, which I performed with collaborative commentary froma group of invited artists, already in attendance at TK2019. Designed as a dancing-word manifesto--fiveparts with script and one entirely improvised--I read each section and then turned to the invited artists fortheir elaboration/response. We discussed ideas with one another and with the other attendees. Then we allmoved about in the immense grand hall while stagehands manipulated beautiful, massive tables, designedby Doris Dziersk, into novel arrangements for each section.Sections in order of presentation: anthropocene :: aesthetics :: globalizations :: queer entanglements:: fear-mongering :: shame.Invited artists included Salamata Kobré, Stephany Ursula Yamoah, Fatou Cissé, Ligia Lewis, Trajal Harrell,Dana Michel, Jens Giersdorf, Eike Wittrock, Sonya Lindfors, Niall Jones, Ni'Ja Whitson, Keith Hennessy,Ishmael Houston-Jones, and Joy Mariama Smith. --T.DF.[1]we move, too much, too quickly, too often. we forget tocare. we aren't nearly so clever as we thought we would be.our future is not promised. but then, the future has alwaysbeen Black.the [Black] anthropocenewe start with the planet. often, we claim indigeneity. thepeople who came before. the ancestors as destiny. in theunited states we do this more and more. the event beginswith the calling forth of the ground. and the people whocame before. we write it down on our websites; we try tolearn to pronounce the names. but the planet rebels. wesee the problem, immediately. the past is fucked up. butwe get nowhere by ignoring it.the past is fucked up. full of missteps and things we thinkwe want to do better. contemporary performance issupposedly a new new, a politicized version of what camebefore, possibly designed with the planet in mind. whatcould a performance be that actually considered, say,carbon footprint or generations of genocide? well, not thisone. we gather here in Dresden with a huge footprint andas though the fact of social and political disavowals andexclusions matter little, or not enough to slow us evenmore. we move too fast. the anthropocene offers dis-course for the turn to the inevitable self-centeredness thatcharacterizes too much of contemporary performance. inthe anthropocene our gestures matter, because they payforward to a world that actually cares about what we do,here and now. the caring is a by-product of necessity:species are wiped out because we build a new performancecenter; there is crass exploitation of materials to makea great show with an extravagant mise-en-scene--liveanimals; decaying sod; an entire building destroyed beforeyour very eyes. in the anthropocene we take the lead bydoing things: dancing, shitting onstage and fucking,trying to elicit empathetic response.the anthropocene fully embraces the performative turn.what and how become one; what we do and how we do itindicate the terms of understanding our influences, inter-ferences, and entanglements. things are dark. meltingice, flooded lands, forced migrations as places becomeunlivable. well, unlivable for us, now, at least. clean water,which was only ever a nominal affordance of the planet,is now disrupted beyond measure by a reliance on plasticand oil, energy coerced to a mass scale.but we still resist the potential of small performances,small intimacies, privacies not distended but rathercared for as minor gestures. we still build hierarchies andbig-up toward celebrity and notoriety. we move too fast.we want--and the wanting becomes solipsistic desire forapproval, affirmation, and acknowledgment of my pain;the me of me, what happened to me?, what I know, whatI figured out, what I can do, watch me work, get out ofmy way.mentoring, teaching, responding to younger artists; wewitness the wanting to matter. emerging artists want tobe seen and regarded. the anthropocene tells us that weall matter, but we can't believe that. the anthropoceneoffers evidence in unprecedented weather: fires, tornados,heat waves, droughts, floods. all at once. in response towhat we do. in the age of human intervention in climate.the anthropocene turns us toward destruction, a self-immolation born of all this need and want. as artistsand critics, we rank among the neediest of all, wantingothers to care that we can shake, scream, stretch, orrefuse to acknowledge someone else's concerns nomatter the movement at hand. we author this anthropo-cene willingly; creating, making, making over, re-doing,doing. trying to be noticed, noticeable, worthy.and we want strangers to care. that seems a lot to ask.a Black anthropocene might recognize the inevitabilityof change as necessary to a life cycle. as inevitable as aninherent lack of control over one's physical trajectory,even when things seem sort of okay. for Black people,the anthropocene is a bit like payback being a bitch: youcan jack off all you want, but at some point, your bodywon't produce fluids or much more than pain. the planethurts, as it tries to sustain all of the growing populace'sunquenchable desires. Black pain, though, is inevitable,and sacrifice comes before any sense of identity oridentity politic.the future has always been black as the population grows,and we fail to comprehend and act on questions of scale.do we really need to be global artists, showing work on sixcontinents? what could it mean to explore a lighter touch,to resist piling on to the jockstraps and menstrual bloodof famous artists from before? or the tyrannies of fakereenactment and vacuous historicizing that reifies a fakecaring about false pasts? the planet rebels. will we scorchthe sky?the anthropocene wonders if we will accelerate its termssimply because we can't figure out how to do any better.or, if we might acknowledge its constant shadow thatexpands as we leak our desire into rank unruliness. weparticipate in it willy-nilly; especially when we dance toprove supremacy.a Black anthropocene is, of course, art-making. daily livesmade up of valuing gesture and detail, noting change,growth, and variety as a way of being present now. survivalas an outgrowth of willful creativity. working Black meansworking willfully towards a structured obsolescence, onethat will destroy the category that defines it if all goes well.we work toward the end of a need for Black, but only asBlack becomes what we are all willing to be, what we areall able to be, what we all might understand in some way.we've already scorched the earth and each other trying todominate. the anthropocene is about human domination,but a Black anthropocene could be about making our wayback towards each other, valuing history as possibilityand a way to share current circumstances. the people whocame before left because they had to. we'll have to, soon,as well. but we don't have to leave our marks. i don't thinkwe do. we could learn to listen. shhhh.what is to be done? how do we move toward an alongside-ness or an adjacency that allows for expansion, ratherthan only constrictions?[3]we move, too much, too quickly, too often. we forget tocare. we aren't nearly so clever as we thought we would be.our future is not promised. but then, the future has alwaysbeen Black.photo © Charlotte Spichalskyglobalizationsit's amazing that we are from all over. that we can gather,however briefly, just long enough to see each other andshare tales of woe. the future is black, we tell each other,but then the future has always been Black.in traveling we learn something of difference, really; of theorderliness of one place and the abundant chaos of another,as in the Tanzkongress here, of the messiness of socialstrains in one neighborhood next to the leafy green happi-ness of a children's space near the bar. traveling, we cantake the time to notice that these venues are similar butunique; that audiences are not undifferentiated masses.that it matters who turns up to see or be involved in theperformance, and it matters who will never come see theshow. as the planet's population expands, every day thereare more and more people who will never witness ourcreative explorations or wonder at the questioning throughperformance that drives our devotions to dance.thinking globally means shifting our attention toward thedifficult considerations of scale that trouble our under-standings of planet, climate, entanglement. these are notsimple concerns to hold. when we are in the dance studioin the small town outside of Berlin, or in Helsinki, whatdoes that have to do with the people chaining themselvesto a police station in Oakland as a performance of defianceto a rising police state? What does me practicing yoga, ordancing salsa, have to do with religious and racial conflictin Sri Lanka?globalization as a process encourages us to forgetdifference and settle into a numbing sameness, whereevery dance is available so long as it can be subsumedinto a locale that denies its specificities. yes, we can yoga atHellerau, and we can kathak in Santiago, and of coursetango in Copenhagen. globalization needs to create smoothterrain that allows for a simultaneity and a sameness,promised as an availability and access for all--well, forthose who have time and the resources/privilege tospend energy on other people's stuff.and globalization is something about eating the other,to quote an older academic text; it might be a leaning intoward desire for difference, and especially an exoticizeddifference that stays unknown and out of proximity. weneed things to be different in order to rhapsodize overtheir superficial contents; we need to be able to not reallyknow what's going on in the Bronx in order to fetishizeand become expert voguers in Hamburg.we forget to care. but we think we can try, and we gatherfrom hither and yon, and we have salons and mini-confer-ences, and we meet, and we imagine that we communicateand connect even when it is sloppy and ill-advised butwe are all artists here, and that must mean that we sharesomething about a willingness to be outside a mainstream,and we must be able to meet there, here, in a place beyondplace, an imaginary place of a long-lasting affair, but anaffair, not a marriage, with the asymmetries bared throughtime, but an affair to remember, a being with where theground could tremble because we try and we want, we wantit to work, we want it to be possible a bit, that we could bealongside each other and not just eat each other up.but then, we would have to learn to listen. and to notice.and to allow for globalization to mean more difficultconversations and discourse, not just more varied. someof us need to fight in our everyday at home, to fight hardwhile others of us don't. we're not aligned just because weare in the same room. we have to fight to actually be heretogether, in our differences that we fight to maintain.in creating global-aware spaces, like this year's Tanz-kongress, so much--so very much--has to be disregardedand elided. for this event to even happen, we have to pre-tend that it is okay to be called into the room and to comeforth; to represent without representing; to be Black andawash in difference even as we are all artists here. this isthe promise of a Black future, though, that this could bepossible. watch us closely. we meet here, and bring ourselves,yes, but can also demonstrate how to leave so much behind,out of reach and unavailable; to leave the Black home ata distance and still survive, smile, make bookings, anddance. we do this all the time, and demonstrate that it canbe done. globalization is possible, and a weird Black othercan still be produced inside of it. at what cost? that wedon't yet know, not really.are all ideas really available to us all? which people fall outof these emergent global orderings?what is to be done? how do we move towards an alongside-ness or an adjacency that allows for expansion rather thanonly constrictions?[5]we move, too much, too quickly, too often. we forget tocare. we aren't nearly so clever as we thought we would be.our future is not promised. but then, the future has alwaysbeen Blackwhen Obama was elected, we noted that gun sales in theUS increased exponentially, supposedly because someamericans assumed that laws against guns would finallybe strengthened a bit; that didn't happen, and insteadwe've just seen more and more mass shootings as morefancy and unexpected firearms find their way to a generalpublic. after Obama left office my husband suggested wearm ourselves against the coming deluge. be afraid. bevery afraid.in France the security at the performances has heightenedafter Paris, after Nice, after Berlin; we stand in line for bagsearches and spot checks; if the company is from Israel weare handled more roughly. we wait in long lines. i don't feelany safer. the people hired to secure our space are afraidtoo; and maybe they have done this before, this guardingthe audience at the dance concert, or the theater, butthey didn't survive Paris, or Nice, or Berlin at christmas,because if they had they wouldn't be here, this is no wayto live no way to make a living no way to go see a showthat means to uplift us because the world is scary and ofcourse a performance will take that away, take away thepain, offer a vista of something else. why would the per-formance just heap more fear and anxiety and confusiononto something already wrecked, already scary? we needthe dance to remind us of grace, and goodwill amongmen, but that's not allowed, I'm afraid, it's not allowedto be an experimental artist who doesn't experiment; beafraid that there is less and less space to be an artist whopleases the public, but who ever wanted to please thepublic? those are the wannabe fake artists who are reallyentertainers who want the people to feel good about them-selves; that is not allowed, it is not allowed to feel safe inthe theater or in the improvisation; it is not allowed to feelgood about yourself, only yourself, because who does that?we are afraid. we move too fast, and too often, afraid tofly or crash land, afraid of the terrorists on the train or inthe theater; or at the music concert in Las Vegas or on thebeach in Ivory Coast.what are you afraid of?that there won't be a job, there isn't a job; that the hier-archies that keep some people in place will never move,the old people will never retire, we will be stuck. I will bestuck. the old people keep coming back and there's no roomfor me for me for meeeeeee to find myself as an artist asa maker as an interpreter, as me not you. I'm afraid thatI won't be able to be me, because you'll be in the way.you're always in the way, the world keeps changing thegame keeps changing. we move too fast. it doesn't changeenough. we waste time with our elders when we should bejust doing shit ourselves, because we want to. i want to. doshit. my own shit. i'm afraid you won't let me do my ownshit. who are you to me?why do i have to know about you? why should i care? i'mafraid to care, i'm afraid i'll never fall in love, and i'll neverhave a relationship i can recognize, i want a fuckmate whowill always be there ready to fuck, ready to love i mean. i'mafraid there won't be anyone, there will only be #metoo,and i will be one of the three who are sexually assaultedamong us, look left look right, one of we three, i'm afraidto be one of the three and that i won't have health care,i won't have an abortion, it's not allowed in the unitedstates, it's not allowed anymore. i'm afraid i can't raisea child i'm afraid i can't afford, there are no jobs, i won'tbe able to live somewhere long term, i don't think longterm. i'm afraid there's no contingency plan that promisestomorrow, tomorrow is not promised.tomorrow was never promised. Black lives matter. exceptwhen they don't, usually. i'm afraid i don't understand racethe way the americans talk about it. i don't understand.i'm afraid i don't care.i'm afraid of a tomorrow without.without any of the things of today, which is already fuckedup, but here we are, i'm afraid of a tomorrow that can'tpossibly make any sense unless it's more of the bullshitthat we have now and here and here and now, that wealready know is broken but we pretend that it's sort ofokay even though lots of us are camping in tents on themuddy ground outside of here, but there are Africanrefugees who can't even get into here and we should alljust fucking be done with it and fucking move to fuckingPoland. just move. just move.what is to be done? how do we move towards an alongside-ness or an adjacency that allows for expansion rather thanonly constrictions?re-mapping. and afterwards, a turn toward a future lookingthat includes Black looks.

The Future Has Always Been Black.How did you get to this point?We were supposed to meet in Vienna during the 6thIDOCDE (International Documentation of Contem-porary Dance Education) Symposium1 called You are here,hosted at ImPulsTanz Festival Vienna 2018. Leading up tothe symposium, we were invited for a weeklong residencycalled Mind the Dance. The theme of the residency wasartistic and reflective practices in dance documentation.One of us didn't make it to Vienna. To this day, we haveactually never physically met, but nonetheless, we havebeen collaborating since the initial point of the residency.What came out of this initial never meeting during theresidency at ImPulsTanz?Well, resonating with the overall theme of the symposium(You are here), the physical distance between you and meshaped our collective research: 2 How were we going tocollaborate without ever physically meeting? After ourfirst sessions--conducted through Skype, email, andWhatsApp--we determined a time frame, possible scores,and tasks for the project. We distilled our conversationsand experiences into the following topics: Absence ofthe other, Fiction of the other, and Space in betweeneach other.• AbsenceWhat does a trace tell us about a missing process?How do we create and feel together in the absence ofthe others?Can we wonder and wander 3 with an absence of directionor specific intent?Do we need to see/sense traces of one who is absent in orderto experience them?• FictionAllows me to imagine the place you are in, which bridges thegap/absence/in-between-ness of another• Space in betweenLike the suspended leg before the next stepInspired by The Go-To How-To Book of Anarchiving,4 weapproached these key topics anarchivally. Rather thandocumenting the content of the event, anarchival pro-cesses capture traces of the event's liveness, which mightset the stage for a next event to occur. We thought ofmovement tasks and perception scores that could beperformed simultaneously in our respective spaces. Wedocumented, traced, and recorded them. The traces ofthese tasks and scores led the research process into newprocesses, becoming a digital/virtual/tactile collage ofwhat happened.A Movement ScoreMove in the memory of someone else's actions...You have not seen this/these person(s), nor their actions.You have never been close physically to this/these person(s).You haven't inhabited the same place.Yet you are sharing the same process.Wander and wonder...For 6 or 60 minutesThank you for sharing your process. And how did youcommunicate your research with the public during theIDOCDE symposium?As a form of presentation, we invited participantsfrom the IDOCDE symposium to step into our ongoingresearch. We set up the space with a 4 x 5m live projectionof you (who joined the whole session via Skype) and ananarchival pathway on the floor consisting of the printedpages of The Go-To How-To Book of Anarchiving. Scoresstemming from our research and written on colored cardsled and guided the group into a participatory anarchivalprocess by which participants created new traces andlived in the becoming of those events and its traces. It isimportant to mention that all anarchival processes havesome sort of sharing.Research presentation scoreWonder and wander for...Enter the space separately.Prepare your space. Prepare the space. Or start the process.Make the choice to discover the whole space or yourown space.Make choices as a result of other people's choices.Leave the space or enter a new space.Focus on distinct senses.At any moment you can observe (active reception) orcontribute (active generation).Attend to the moments when there is some thingcrystallizing.Be aware when you are  feeling (experiencing) and whenyou are performing your feeling (making visible yourexperience).Collect artifacts and bring them into the space.You are always part of the score/event, no matter if you arein or out of the space in which the event is being held.As mentioned above, traces have become essential for yourresearch. Can you describe more precisely what you meanwhen you talk about traces?Traces are, in essence, an anarchive of experiences thatcannot be fully possessed due to their ephemerality butcan be impulses to push the research further. In ananarchival sense, traces are the tip of the iceberg. Atrace is multiple:A trace is formless memory (of an event).A trace is a mediator in the proof of our existence for another.A trace is a container, a snapshot, leftover coffee drips on theedge of a paper cup.A trace limits the past's unlimited potential to unfold inthe future.Our lives are composed of traces, outlines, pathways,images, sketches, memories, narratives.Everything is a trace of something else. Not all traces aremeant to last forever.It's the letter left behind asking:What makes you real? I want to challenge the limits ofgetting closer and closer but not meeting. Maybe gettingcloser is weaving a web with more and more connectingstrings. Getting closer is cumulative. Getting closer is tobecome more and more relational to each other. What ifa body is defined by its capability to build relations withother bodies?And how did the idea come up to continue the project afterthe residency?We were enchanted with how to encounter another with-out ever sharing the same time/space. Our imaginationand fictional projection of each other provided a potentspace to work from. After Deleuze and Derrida, who bothreconciled presence and absence no longer as oppositesbut rather as a related and interchangeable pair,5 wewondered: How do we move in the present absence of theother where these binary terms actually switch roles andabsence becomes a different kind of presence? Wecontinued asking questions:How can we trace each other's absent movements?How can we activate the other's absence throughimmaterial traces?What does a trace tell us about the other's absence?What do we share in the other's absence?What is the physicality of absence?From this point, we needed to find shared tasks/objectsthat served as connecting mediators. We set up collectivereading times. We picked the same book--in this case,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval NoahHarari--to read at the same time, in separate places.We created a 30-day/30-second dance score. Every day,individually, we instantly composed a 30-second danceand filmed it. We then sent these dances to each other.We sent unfinished stories via post for each other to finish.These collected and created traces became the material tocontinue the forward-feeding process for our performanceinstallation in Amsterdam, also called You are here.Would you describe the set-up for the performanceinstallation You are here?In January 2019, we had the opportunity to share ourresearch with passersby in a semi-public performancespace in the de Pijp neighborhood of Amsterdam.6 Sincewe were both in Amsterdam, our spatial proximity wasincreasing. We inhabited the same exhibition space (a formershop window) separately at different times over a periodof five days, for five hours each day. First, you wouldinhabit for two and a half hours. I would come in after youhad left, for another two and a half hours. We'd continuethis cycle each day. The shop window served as a thresholdof in-betweenness from inside to outside, from private topublic. It allowed for transparency to flow between innerand outer spaces. Each day we arranged and rearrangedobjects, materials, and our bodies; we wrote letters andleft notes for each other; we used different materials, likechalk, string, tape, and paper, while performing in andwith the present absence of the other. Our performancesaccumulated material and immaterial traces of eachother's absence. Words became a medium to describethe visibility of one and the invisibility of the other.Wait a second, you just mentioned that written andspoken words became a medium to connect to eachother's absence. Can you further elaborate on that?Sure. Let's say in language there are always multiple voicesthat weave through time continuums of present, past, andfuture. Reading your notes, memories, or stories articulatedyour past through my present/future. Your thoughtsexpanded in reverberation with my body's presence. Theyvibrated through my skin. They vibrated through spaceand through the architecture of the window. As I projectinto your future, you sit in my past.And what about movement? How did you expand yourbodily presence into the presence of each other's absence?Sometimes moving in stillness was my only response;sometimes I moved by imagining how you might havemoved before me. But indeed, moving in the memory ofsomeone you have never met--or moving with an inten-tion of layering movements upon the absence of another--was quite challenging. Through the material traces youleft behind, I tried to imagine your immaterialized bodychoreographies. I found myself measuring my body inorder for you to have a sense of my size. Maybe that couldbe the closest trace of my physicality. The performancespace was filled with pieces of string naming body partsor the relation between body parts--connecting points,separating surfaces. Connecting us? Movements them-selves are untraceable. How do I leave movements behind,untethered to any trace, piece of paper, string, chalk,or words? How to move in, from, and with the presentabsence of the other?Do you want to share any other insights you had during theperformance or its reverberations?In line with Derrida's conception of presence and absenceas something beyond a static binary that once connectedpresence to an absolute truth or origin, and absence toimitation or copy,7 I experienced absence and presenceas being in a blurry, occasionally confusing relationshipwith each other--not defined by opposition. Rather, theyare layered into each other; they are autonomous fromeach other as much as they are not; absence and presencedo not follow linear measurements. Absence activatesdifferent experiences of time. As I am writing you thisletter, I project into your future. When you read the letter,you sit in my past. Since we developed shared tasks thathappened at the same time but in different places, and inthe same place but at different times, we swam in the seaof temporalities, where past, present, and future actionsmerged, overlapped, and intertwined.During the five-day performance, both of you were stayingin Amsterdam. What would have happened if you hadaccidently bumped into each other?I guess we would have turned around and run away as fastas possible. I can also imagine that we would just standstill. Take a moment. Then turn around and walk quietlyin opposite directions.One last question: How would you describe the relationshipyou have been building (while never meeting) during thepast year?I would describe our relationship as one of disorientationrather than anything linear, and in that, a tremendousamount of closeness has developed. As I wander in my steps,an imagination of you is by my side. With you, I come closerto sensing the multiplicity of time/events. These conditionscreate an experimental context to train trust, care, andsolidarity; a way of being-with and working together thatexceeds boundaries of space and time and quantifiablemeasurements. Proximity and distance are playfullyentangled, without seeking to close the gap between us.Our research group consisted of Ilana Reynolds (US/GER)and Sabrina Huth (GER), as well as John Taylor (NL) andNicolas Hubert (FR), who supported the research process.3 Dutch curator, writer, and researcher Christel Vestersexplores the potential of wandering as an alternative wayof knowing and being in the world. According to Vesters,Wanderlust refers to a curiosity-driven mindset, the longingto discover uncharted terrain without a settled plan or fixedobjective. Guided by chance, the figure of the Wandererembraces whatever they come across. It is in this sense thatart and literature both adopted the figure of the Wanderer asthe personification of the romantic, free spirited, the unboundvagabond. However, there is a dark and dystopian side to thefigure of the Wanderer as well--the Wanderer who is not onlygeographically lost but also mentally disoriented; lost in theirown mind, their own way of thinking, their own logic.

It is located at the corner of FerdinandBolstraat, not far from the crossing with the Ceintuurbaan.The public for this window includes passing shoppers, children,tourists, and art lovers. The window is a platform for artists tocreate an installation specifically for this location. The narrowinsular space in relationship to the street is a new startingpoint for each exhibition. 7 Bell, Absence/Presence.MargitI'm interested in talking specifically about how imagesform and have been informed by your dance life, and alsohow the particular ways of relating to image through yourexperience of Skinner Releasing and then later throughthe practice of Amerta Movement have affected yourrelationship with your moving body.SallySo I guess the first thing that stands out was I started withSkinner Releasing, and about the same time I was doing alot of butoh (with Joan Laage), and they somehow overlap.At that time, the experience with my moving body hadvery much a sense of disappearing.In order to blend or merge with an image introducedfrom outside myself, I needed to slowly release tension,and then to disappear in order to become the image.More recently, I've realized through the Amerta practicethat I can merge with an image without disappearing.I have a very specific memory while doing the OngoingSkinner Releasing Training, after working with Prapto inJava, where I could sense both my body and an image atthe same time, which was new for me. Amerta changed myrelationship to my moving body as well as how I receivethe image.The other thing is: Where is the image coming from?In Skinner Releasing, the image comes through the poetryof the language. In butoh, images come through differentsensorial experiences and can be nonverbal--looking at apicture in a book, entering a nature environment, smellinga flower.Prapto's work has both a sense of the dream worldand the reality world--there's a sense of more materialitythere in the image. I think this was the point when theimage started to transform into a costume for me. It wasmy way of creating poetry, a kind of material poetry. Sothe image, or the costume, came from the moving bodyitself, as opposed to somebody's words. It became morenonverbal, something I can touch, something I can feel.Images can live in the verbal realm and in the nonverbalrealm. I can disappear and the image takes over, or Ican sense the image with my body, existing in thehere and now.MargitCould you share your experience of that moment wherebody and image came together?SallyI can't remember the specific image. I don't know if it wasferns, I'm not sure, but the sense of it is a spirally imagethrough my body. At the same time, I could feel and sense,and maybe even see, the bones, the muscles, the tissues,the cells. They didn't feel separate; they just felt more likea unified meeting. It wasn't the body trying to find theimage or the image trying to find the body; they werejust existing.I feel it kinesthetically, or in my body, so it can endup being a quality, but it's still an image, and it cantransform.LilyIn Skinner Releasing, what I experienced right away wasthere was this immediacy of the kinesthetic experience ofthe image. I could immediately feel it in my body. When Iwas in dance school, I thought that everybody else had alot of fantasy. I didn't have those kind of stories, and I wasworried about it. [laughing]When I experienced working with anatomical imagery(the first time was Release and Alignment Technique withJohn Rolland, an ideokinetic approach), it gave me moretrust that there is a different kind of sensorial imaginationthat for me is immediately in the body; not so much a storythat I'm telling with my body. So it's more like a poeticapproach to me. There is this sense of expanding possibil-ity through images, and this sense of poetic experience inmy body as it is, or as it may be. Which then can transformit. This is hard to put in words and beyond what the actualmatter of it is....Something that came up yesterday when I was inthe studio was the imagination of an image, because I feelthere is a difference between image and the imagination.There are overlaps, but there is a difference actually.Sometimes the imagination of the image is so, in a way,beyond the body that I can feel the limitations of my body,my physical body, moving. And sometimes, like yesterday,I didn't feel those limitations even though I was awareof them in the space. That my arms, like the fingertips,are in a certain place in the space as I move, yet with myimagination, they might be much farther out there. I loveit when I don't feel the limitation of my physical abilities.[laughing] And I feel also that practicing, for example,Skinner Releasing helps me to be more able to expand myphysical abilities.There is a spaciousness and an expanding. Layers,also. And then there is also the immediacy of listening.Like, what is the image? There is this stillness involved.Or silence perhaps. In the chapter that I submitted for thebook about Skinner Releasing Technique, I write aboutlistening and poetry. Listen and silent have thesame letters.I like what you said, Sally, about how in SkinnerReleasing, poetic language is the source of the image. I amin love with the use of poetry in SRT. I keep using the wordimmediacy with what I feel; maybe that's why theseimages work so well for me.I realize I don't think of Amerta in image, with image,in relation to image. It's not a first connection I make.MargitWhat would you call it instead, Lily?LilyThe first thing that comes up is making connections. Orfinding the connections that are already there and experi-encing them. And what do these connections mean in mydancing life, body, being? People, nature, tree. Sculpture.Me. Sun. Rest of the world. [laughing] But then it couldalso be a connection between an image that I have ofmyself or an image I have of the world. In that sense,image is there.JulieAn early experience in the Skinner Releasing world, itcould have been yesterday: dancing with an image, therewas poetic image and there is also touch from anotherperson, which is also a form of image--landing, andtaking you, and the body...But now I'm feeling that the experience is actuallyof novelty--like a feeling of surprise. There's a thing thatSally: Integrating SRT and Amerta, I have begunto tap a multifaceted dance between body andimage. Body and image can appear/disappear;breathing between material/immaterial land-scapes, hovering between verbal/nonverbalrealms, embodying and evoking sensation/imagination, received and activated throughmovement/stillness. The location of imagesshapes the moving body's experience--whetherarising inside, outside, or in between body andimage. Somatic Costumes are a bridge; whenworn, a costume is experienced as inside thebody through touch and outside the body throughexternal form. Costume offers poetic materiality.Lastly, an image may be static or moving--alive.Image is always in-forming if it's alive. It nevercompletes the process of forming itself.Julie: I hold the question of what fresh images arise while sitting in open atten-tion to where-I-sit. In this, the technique of Skinner meets the river of Amerta,the genius of places speaking. A quality of seeing, wherein what is caught in thepoint of sight is received as itself doing the speaking. The mobile, angled bonesof pelvis, shoulder, [index] finger, that reference self and world. Fluted pointsmade by Gayogohono people, present and original inhabitants of this land. Aspecific image seems to live a long life within before taking form in the mouth.comes to mind that playing is what gives us the ability torespond to surprise, so we end up surprised by somethingthat is open, that is opening--something from outsideof what we anticipate or remember in our experience. Ido think about image and the play of image as being thisunique and momentary confluence of implicit consciousmemory and explicit memory, as the micro-fibers of mem-ory momentarily come together and blossom inside myselfor another. Kinesthetic experiences or life experiences,that each time it's new. I think this kind of image is verypersonal, and something about that action of the imagein the dancer, in myself, is one of experiencing wholeness.That experience of my body as whole. And then also, attimes, this thing occurs, which I connect with SkinnerReleasing but is not unique to it, that is the interplay ofself and context. The dissolution of distinction may be onearea I get more of in Amerta. And I suspect that's becauseso much is there--being (moving) in nature, in humanculture--that the immediacy of wind or of a dialoguewith another has more than the tactile, which can also bethe possibility of understanding...across distinctions ordifferences.My sense of how image is working in Amerta feelsvery much about the sensations of the place, the questionsof the place, where we are.The way I understand space as an image in SRTis that it connects with bodily roots of knowing andpossibility. I feel like the image of space is like an anchorthat actually helps bridge back to something that thebody knows.SallyThere was something, when you were talking aboutspace, Julie, that I really relate to in connection withSkinner Releasing. And then when I think about imagewith Amerta practice, I feel it's much more about theplace. With Skinner Releasing, I'm feeling an image andseeing it in my body as I'm moving. There is this clearpoetic language given to me that I'm experiencing, and it'slike I'm arriving in the space; my body feels the languagesomehow.And then I have this memory of being on Prapto'sland in Mojosongo. I remember moving, and all of a sud-den it felt like my body was reappearing. I could sense mybones, and then all of a sudden my muscles, and then Icould sense my breath kind of circulating in a completelydifferent yet concrete way. Just moving in that place, theimage appeared through the visceral and kinesthetic.Image isn't the first word I associate with Prapto'swork, unless he does something very simple connectedto the body: feel your feet coming from the earth. Thenit's more connected to my sense of the way I experienceimage work and Skinner Releasing. Instead, I experiencePrapto's languaging and practices more like symbols. I'mgiven symbols: oval, circle, square. [laughing] They can beimages, but they have all these layers of meaning that arerelated to place, culture, and an idea of the world. It affectsmy body through a different process.LilyJulie, you said the word opening, and it's actually oneof the main words that I usually connect to what I exper-ience in using imagery and with Skinner Releasing.Opening, and opening into opening, this is how I've beendeveloping my own imagery. And that has to do withexpanding. And I think there is something interesting;now that I have been practicing this approach for so longand it's in my daily practice, I'm connecting more to ana-tomical information. I'm more excited when I read somethings about BMC [Body-Mind Centering] or craniosacralpractice. I can tune into my own body more easily thanbefore. It took me another process first to be able to makesome kind of sense of it--that this is a natural fact...but, just to use words. I had to enter and tune in fromanother angle.48 CONTACT QUARTERLYWINTER/SPRING 2020MargitMy experience of how I relate to embodiment has to dowith qualities, texture, form, color, flow, and weight. Thesethings are experiential, sensorial, or energetic. I've hadexperience through BMC, with what Bonnie BainbridgeCohen calls somatization, where you see a picture of theanatomic process, then you move with it, and it becomesunderstood through somatic integration. When you'repracticing SRT, what actually is it that's being developed?How does the image develop? Is it material? Is it a qualityfor movement?LilyI used the word connections with Amerta, but I also feelthat a lot in Skinner Releasing--this connection betweenmy physical dancing body and what's beyond that, bothinside and outside, and integrating; feeling the onenessof that.MargitHow is that arising?LilyPerhaps one way is through the practice of integratingthe inner awareness of an image and your relation to theoutside so that both happen at the same time. So thatthese boundaries become thinner, or they may disappear.One area where I feel they are disappearing more is withwhat is called a totality image--where you merge withthe image. So then there is this sense of oneness as well asdifferentiation and refinement within.MargitI think about how Prapto talks about sensory motor, notjust sensory. Is kinesthetic experience bodily? What isthe relationship between an image and something havingform? How does an image get formed? From where doesthat form arise? There's a process of turning into some-thing and coming into its clarity. Becoming formulated.And an image is just maybe the initiatory process fromwhich that forming takes place.Lily: Pak Prapto speaks about being perceived while we dance.Indonesia helps with this. There is willingness to see me. I feel easilyperceived. By the land, the green, by sea, the people who live there,by sky, path, ancestors, by tree and its long life, its intrinsic wisdom,by shells who washed ashore and resettled. By what is beyond all that.I am not alone. And through this I feel this is not about me. It neveris. While simultaneously, by feeling perceived, I feel included. Beingperceived expands any image of the dance. Even if there is no image.JulieWhen I think about my urge to make a dance, my idiosyn-cratic way that I want to make a dance is very often fromsome kind of image. The guidance often shows up fromthe specific image, and that is the placeholder of all themultiplicity of directions that I could go. It can just unfold,elaborate, and guide, to keep things from becoming justlimitless; so it forms. So I get to find something out, and inAmerta work it seems to be OK, but what are you going todo? What is your application? In Releasing, I technicallylearn how to unfold, go inside of something; instead ofbeing on the outside, I can go in. And then I can inhabitthis space, and this was the transition for me in Releasing--the question was, What is in the space? And that seemedto be the propulsion from working with somebody else'simages into beginning to recognize the presence of otherimages and what the quality of the image was so that itcould be mined, or explored, or sat inside of. That feelslike something that is a process of creation.STREAMSMargitHow is image developing through your own work? Whereis the meaning for you now, and how is it filtered throughthese influences?SallyDeveloping the Somatic Costume work has been one ofmy key practices in developing my relationship to image:How can I guide myself/others between facts/fictions,the reality/dream world and the material/immaterial?Images became more material. For example, the FurryHeart Protector costume came from the poetry of natureand my moving body. When moving with stones on thebeach I began putting stones on my body. Sensing theweight, the texture, the quality of the stones, I realized Ineeded something to protect my heart. I started makinga costume by taping stones on the front and the back ofmy heart. In that process, I thought, Ah, OK, I understandwhen Prapto said 'Sally, please don't just sense the frontof the heart; sense also the back of the heart and the placein between.' With stones now on my body, I could experi-ence what he was saying. The image was touching me.LilyFor me it is in my daily practice, in my training. I literallystart my day with going into an image in my body, andthrough that, the images develop; so it's not necessarilythe image from Skinner Releasing, but it comes from therebecause it is what I've been practicing for so long. So theimages are developing continuously through my dailypractice. I also taught workshops where I used imagesthat I developed further, from the practice and my teach-ing. This is something I do to be in tune with my body andwith the world, with the reality of the imagination: theexperience of expansion. Working with stillness has beendeepened by my practice of SRT, particularly some imagesthat I was very moved by in the beginning. Now, in mywork, I am working more radically with stillness. So it'sdirectly influencing my work.JulieI feel pretty far from Skinner Releasing, but if I can sort ofcredit what I feel, the tone of being in the world of imageand movement, or image and action, connects with thatsort of power to draw from multiple sources at once. Myimmediate response right now is personal; I'm writing,doing photography, mapping, and working with fabric.In my weekly practice of going outside and dancingcontinuously for one hour, the encounter is more withall of that memory but also the immediacy of ice, snow,wind, perfume, moments of performativity.uENDNOTE1 The SRT images at the basic level fall into two categories:specific and totality imagery. An example of a specific is theimage of marionette strings at the knees...designed to allowgreater freedom in the hip socket. An example of a totality isthe image of floating in a pool. Then the whole self merges withthe pool--the outer edges of the self becoming the outer edgesof the pool. At times the specific string image is integratedwithin the pool totality.... In a way, the imagination can be saidto be actively improvising on the images that are given, makingthem relevant to the needs of the student's process at any givenmoment. Joan Skinner, Bridget Davis, Robert Davidson, KrisWheeler, and Sally Metcalf, Skinner Releasing Technique:Imagery and Its Application to Movement Training,Contact Quarterly Vol. 5 no. 1 (Fall 1979).Bonnie, at home in northern California; Nancy, at homein western Massachusetts.Nancy: Self and Other, or SelfOther, is a concept thatyou've been exploring in your recent workshops. Arethey different concepts or the same?Bonnie: I think they're both important; it's not one or theother. I've been interested in community forever--SBMC[The School for Body-Mind Centering] was a vehicle forestablishing community. How does that happen? Self andOther is one way of looking at it. As individuals, we're nota single entity. We're multifaceted.... And as a communitywe're an entity, but within that, we're multifaceted.We start with an egg and a sperm, that's already twovery different consciousnesses. And then at one point we'reeight cells--we could become eight individuals; that'swhen they do in vitro fertilization--so we have withinus the possibility of eight distinct people! And we aredifferent personalities in different situations. Not like asplit personality, where people lose the unity and get lostin the multiplicity. But in different times of our lives or indifferent moments of the day, different personalities comeforth, either to bug us [laughing] and cause distress or tobalance out the others. Instead of seeing this as a problem,we can see this as calling forth another aspect of Self.NSS: The diversity within the Self?BBC: Yeah. So it could be a relationship issue or a workissue or illness or whatever brings out different aspectsof our Self. These different aspects of Self exist and areavailable, and some will be more dominant, some morehidden. How do we balance the matrix of our Self? Howdo we integrate all the aspects of possibility? There's atendency for stronger elements to be more active. Andthen something happens and we have to call forth moreof the hidden. I'm really--internally and also externally--playing with that.When we're in the womb, our birth mother is theenvironment, and at the same time our egg was in ourmother when she was in her mother. So our grandmotherwas the vehicle. She was the one who was our first contactwith the outer world, with whatever culture that was, orsituation--emotional, physical, spiritual.I was reading something interesting, Nancy, thatthe body of the person comes mainly from the egg. Butthe catalyst, the movement, comes from the sperm. I'vedialogued with western science, biology, physiology, andMaybe when we are simply present in the moment, there is noseparation between listening and expression.neurology since I was 16 years old. From them I've learnedabout form and function. Within that context, I'm alwayslooking at process within the form, so I've found otherthings. This process reveals itself through the presenceand movement of consciousness through the body. In away, that's the sperm-ness moving through the egg-ness.The egg is creating form, but it can't create formwithout the motion. Some of us tend to be more motionable,and some of us tend to be more in stillness. That stabilityof form and the mobility of transforming our form varyamong each of us and change within us continually. It'sthat dialogue and interplay between us and within usthat creates SelfOther and Self and Other.Nancy: Do you feel there needs to be a distinction (inBMC practice and/or language around that practice)between science's largely objective lens and a moresubjective way of working that acknowledges outcomesthat are grounded in personal experience? Is there a gaphere to be bridged?Bonnie: Communication occurs in multiple ways.There is the objective approach of observation of othersvia vision and hearing that Western science has primarilylimited itself to. The modern scientific method is oftenonly viewed this way.Then there is the transmission of knowledge throughpersonal experience, in which we can utilize all of oursenses and cellular processes.For example, the ocean can be studied throughdescriptive words, paintings, audio recordings, and videos.Yet until you have personally experienced the ocean, yourunderstanding of it remains only conceptual and/ormetaphorical. It lacks depth of knowing.For me, fully actualized science has the depth of percep-tion based on both the observable and the experienced.The basic question is, can it be transmitted to others, andcan the patterns that emerge be deeply studied and sharedas collective research? Personal experience, foundationalfor astute observation, provides a reality that objectiveinformation alone can only allude to.Cell to Brain, Brain to CellNSS: How are you working in your Self and Otherworkshops to embody the ideas that you're talkingabout? I know that the basis of your work is not justtalking philosophy but embodying things!BBC: First I want to say something about the phenomenonof cell to brain on the same side, and brain to cell on theopposite side.For example, if somebody has a stroke on the rightside of the brain, we know that the left side of the bodyis paralyzed. If they have a stroke on the left side of thebrain, the right side of the body is paralyzed. That is justknown. When the brain is injured, it can no longer processinformation coming in from or going out to the relatedcells on the opposite side of the body.But what I've discovered over the last 10 years has beenthat when the weight of your consciousness, or awareness,is in the cellular experience--for which you have to pauseand wait to perceive a response--the information travelsfirst to the same side of the brain that the cells are on.This traveling along the same side of the body is probablyvascular and fascial rather than neurological. The bloodvessels do not cross the midline in the same way that thenerves do. And the vascular system is an older system. Theheartbeat, as an example, begins at three weeks embryolog-ically; the brainwaves begin in the fetus at about sixmonths. The circulatory system is an older one thanthe nerves, and the nerves rest on the foundation ofthe vascular pathways.NSS: Is the cellular level a slower process?BBC: It is slower in that the cells are reorganizing. Bypausing and holding the space for the cells to absorb theircurrent state, they begin to recognize their present inter-relationships and begin to return to the primal relationshipsdeveloped in the embryo that created our original form,before other patterns set in. The cells are then releasedfrom the outer, more static or fixed control of the brain.An example: If someone has an injury on the rightside of the brain and has paralysis in the left leg and arm,it's effective to start working cellularly with the right leg,which is, quote, okay. This allows the cellular informationon the right side of the body to travel to the right side ofthe brain, which is injured. Then work cellularly with theleft leg, which is affected, to send information to the leftside of the brain, which is okay. We then repeat the sameprocess with the arms. The results can be extraordinary.The brain cells are nourished by reexperiencing the primalfoundation, established in the embryo, of communicationbetween cells on the same side of the body.When we say focus on this subject, we're engagingthe pathway from the brain to the cells. Then we have topause in order for the cells to communicate more informa-tion back to the brain. So what I found with this cell tobrain on the same side is that by working cellularly on thesame side of the body as the brain injury, more informationcomes into the injured side of the brain. Therefore, it hasmore information from which to then control the opposite,or affected, side of the body. I'm giving the example of astroke because that's the most common and clearest tounderstand, but it would be true for anything. If you workwith the right leg cellularly, it will go to the right side ofthe brain; if you work with the left leg cellularly, it will goto the left side of the brain. Then as the brain has moreinformation, it automatically utilizes that information incontrolling the opposite side of the body.It's very interesting because it actually works. Not withevery person, because not everything works for every person.Both of these things are happening all the time--cell to brain, brain to cell, cell to brain.... We need bothconnections.What I will often say is, Open the back of your brain.The information comes in through the back of the centralnervous system--the back of the spinal cord and brain--and the motor pathways come out through the front. Weare just built that way.Bonnie and Dodge exploring the separateness of Self andOther and the unity of SelfOther.Deep Listening and ExpressionBBC: How this might relate to Self and Other... You andI are sharing now, right? We're talking, and I can say,Well, Nancy, what do you think about this? But if I keepthinking Nancy, what do you think about this? I'm notgoing to really take in what you're saying. But if I open theback of me and just be receptive, in deep listening, thenthere's a pause, and then from that deep listening I comeforward with my expression and understanding, and yougo into the back of your body (spinal cord and brain) intodeep listening.NSS: What do you think about the alternation of those? Ifeel like in dancing and improvising and Contact Improvi-sation--and I would think also in bodywork--it's always acombination. You're listening, you feel a signal of where tomove or what to say or do, and then you do it, and then youpause again. Right? Would you say they alternate, or arethey always happening at the same time?BBC: I think it's probably alternating, slowly or at greatspeed. And sometimes you jump circuit. I could say weinterrupt the cycle. For some people it's an interruption,and for some other people it's just a faster connection. Insome cultures, you're on top of each other in a very fastrhythm, and in others, there's a lot of lonnnng phrasingand in others, short phrasing--the difficulty happenswhen one is a short phraser and the other's a long phraser,or one is slow and the other is quick. Maybe when weare simply present in the moment, there is no separationbetween listening and expression.For example, in Contact Improvisation, if you arenot receiving information cellularly into the back of yourspinal cord and brain and are instead trying to figure outhow to respond to a situation from the front of your brain,you can get hurt, because you're inhibiting the reflexiveknowing from the present cellular experience. Incominginformation comes in through the back, outgoing motorresponses go out through the front. In any current situa-tion, to the degree that we are not open to the incominginformation and are responding only through the frontof our brain, we are engaged in habitual behavior, whichresides in the front. Reflexive motor response is based onyour cellular knowing in the present moment rather thanon preconceived ideas, principles, and habits of experiencethat are now stored in the front of your brain.NSS: What I've enjoyed over the years about ContactImprovisation is that it's a kind of conversation whereyou're able to talk and listen at the same time--or veryrapidly alternating--and the rhythms created by thevarying lengths of either one of those, in terms of priorities,vary. Obviously, if there's a dangerous moment, the actionmight take quick priority; or conversely, in an openmoment, where you don't have a strong impulse to DOanything, there might be more listening. I love the ideaof being in that pause, that open moment, together.Differentiating Self and OtherBBC: With SelfOther, we need to also differentiate Self andOther. The distinction between the two is very important.There's a cycling within and between us that's becomingone. Thoughts, feelings, whatever is moving between us--we are becoming a unit of SelfOther. At the same time,you are Other to me and I am Other to you. I'm not Nancy,and you're not Bonnie. For instance, you mentioned earlierthat years ago when you were in a workshop with me onTransitional Fluid, I had said something that was mean-ingful to you, but it was your experience that you shared,not mine.NSS: Yeah, it's wonderful that you always point that out,because it's very common for people to say, You said thisand I learned that from you. But you are provoking mylearning for myself.BBC: Exactly. Or people will say your work. I would say itbecomes our work.NSS: Well, it does ultimately. But this pointing to experience,this kind of provocation that you're creating, is the environ-ment, the condition, in which I have my experience. Creatingthat condition is an essential and important factor in theevolution of our consciousness. People in your workshopsaren't just wandering around the room without any direc-tion. I mean, your presence gives a lot of direction, but that'snot always quite enough. You give more orientation thanthat. I feel like the condition that you set up--and that weall set up in our teaching and structuring of improvisationsand our relationship to our communities--is veryinfluential and crucial in what happens among people.I want to honor the function of creating conditionsfor experience. This creating of conditions in which peoplecan learn and discover on their own, within a communitywith a positive, accepting, benevolent intention, is a veryspecial and hard-to-describe art form...or skill. It's hardto pin it down, but you can feel it when it's there.BBC: I think we're planting seeds and blowing them intothe wind. But you can't grow the seed--the seed has togrow itself. And then you end up with a forest. You mayhave started with one tree giving seeds and then thoseseeds grow trees that grow seeds. And the tree that issetting these seeds received a seed from others. The Selfand the Other each is an entity and together becomesSelfOther. Yet within SelfOther, there's a Self and an Other.Unless you've had a practice of some kind that allows Selfand Other to become SelfOther, it separates more andmore into Self and Other.One of the things I've done quite a bit over the lastyears in workshops is that I'll ask people to stand one byone and say their name. As an example, I'll say Bonnieand sit down. To stand, to speak your name, and to hearyour name before you sit down. So you really establishyour space in the room, and everyone really establishestheir space in the room before we do anything together.Many people hate that. Because to stand out, to reallyclaim your space, is often difficult. A lot of people maybecome late because they don't want to do it--as a first thing,before people know each other. We're standing in front ofstrangers. But by the end, there's a way that the space, themind of the room, has formed a community. It's the clarityof I'm here. Each one: I'm here and I recognize that youare here and that we are all here together.NSS: I'm wondering if you give time in your workshops foran open space with little instruction, an open nonverbalmoment for moving or being still, to just process the day'sinformation and experience, integrating the Self and theOther within the day's work.BBC: In my classes, there are no two people who do thesame thing. There are times when I'll just say, OK, this isyour playground; whatever you want to do. Especially nowwhen I'm having such large workshops, I might have twoor three rooms where people can choose a different space.The spaces have their own feeling, their own quality. Somepeople will be dancing; some just lying down; some doinghands-on, giving and receiving individual attention; sometalking, looking at anatomical models, handouts.In the beginning, there's a very strong form, but throughmost of the rest, there's very little form. The theme mightbe comparing and exploring the pubic disc versus thesacrum as the keystone of the arch between the two legsand noticing how the sacrum, as the keystone, locks thespine, and the pubic disc frees the spine. Do it and seehow you feel.NSS: What's interesting to me is that in your work and inthe work you have generated with others, there is a rangefrom very specific anatomical instruction, like what youjust described, to a very wide open place of exploration.Or vice versa. I think that's remarkable and wonderful.BBC: In discussions after an exploration, people will say,I don't know what to say--because it's preverbal. That'sone of our challenges in the field of somatics--how do wecreate verbal and written language. You and Lisa, throughCQ, have been at the forefront of that. How does experiencecome back to words? How do we create a vocabulary ofpreverbal experience that then goes back to the experience?So that the verbal isn't what is being transmitted but rathertransmits back to original experience. It's another seed.BBC: OK. I mentioned earlier the egg and the sperm, theembryology, and I'd like to add something. In the womb,the baby and the mother are one--SelfOther. And thengradually we become separate from the mother, but we'restill identified within the family, within the culture, withinthe era or country. We may or may not be comfortablewith any of these, but we're inescapably influenced bythem.

It's happened atother times in history, but with the Internet we have thepossibility of a unity even if we don't want it. How do we notlose our independent sense of Self, and how do we embracenow the SelfOther with the world itself--including natureand the environment?We're being challenged today at such an enormousscale. There are those who are intensifying the Self ANDOther, and there are those who are advocating for moreSelfOther. And it depends on each of us. How do we helpto build, within a dance, a movement class, or what we'redoing, the recognition of SelfOther within the context ofSelf and Other--the possibility of it through the experienceof it. To point to it isn't enough. There has to be the space,the space for the experience. And then to bring it back intowords so we can think about it, discuss it, and share it, andthen go BACK into the experience. Not to lose our Self andthe recognition of other Selves but to embrace both fully.After we turned the recording off, Bonnie said, Let's breathein and out together.

    "content": "The goal of our presence in the ITCPM was to providea safe and healing container to help all participants (victims,judges, and staff support) recover from the exhaustingexperience of sharing and listening to traumatic eventsduring the hearings. To accomplish that, Dulce and Idesigned the curriculum for the workshops. The objectiveswere as follows:a) To introduce the elements of stillness/action,relaxation/tension, and exertion/recuperation usinga somatic approach, mainly based on Body-MindCentering® (BMC) fundamentals of developmentalmovement proposed by Bonnie Bainbridge Cohenb) To create a positive and playful environment thatsupports participants' relationships, trust, andresilienceIn addition to BMC elements, Marcela introducedFeldenkrais principles. We also used elements of traumaand resilience from the Strozzi Institute and SomaticExperiencing® from Peter Levine.Some of the scores/exercises proposed were awarenessof the front and back body and three dimensions of thebody (length, width, and depth); awareness of the body'ssupports and yielding into the earth; walking awarenessand relation with the space; and transition between stillnessand action supported by prevertebrate developmentalpatterns. We worked with cellular breathing, sponging,and pulsating, which are basic neurocellular patternsof BMC. We emphasized how cellular breathing supportsstillness with presence, and sponging and pulsatingsupport action with awareness of our boundaries andresilience, which prepare us to establish contact withthe space and others.In addition, we were very interested in proposinggroup movement scores that would foster connectionsbetween participants. We found it useful to first useelastic bands as individuals explored the strength andresilience from the extracellular fluid, as well as theregulation of tone, tension, and relaxation. Gradually, weproposed scores with elastic bands and balls in duets andgroups, which created mutual connections, trust, andinterdependency. It was very useful to use the bands as ametaphor for individual and collective resilience and thepower of the collective to address trauma.Marcela, who joined the team close to the conveningof the hearings, introduced elements of the Feldenkraismethod. She offered a lesson about torsions, exploringturning right and left in space while differentiating theparts of the body that can initiate this movement (head,chest, eyes). This lesson fostered coordination as a prepa-ration for the rest of the session. She also conducted ashort lesson on external breathing, which complementedthe BMC experiences of cellular breathing. Each sessionfinished with a playful group exercise, and participantswere invited to share their experiences during the session.",

    "content": "The first workshop took place in the rural teacher-training college Raúl Isidro Burgos in Ayotzinapa, beforethe first tribunal hearing in Guerrero. The other threeworkshops took place in Chilpancingo, where the restof the tribunal hearings were being held.One of the main learning experiences for us was tobe flexible to change and adapt the curriculum of theworkshops to the modifications in the agenda of thetribunals, the number of people available to participate,the time limitations, and the conditions of the spaceswhere the sessions were taking place. After each class,the somatic team met to evaluate the session and planthe necessary modifications in the curriculum for thenext day.The first session in Ayotzinapa was shorter than therest of the sessions, lasting 30 minutes. It was repeated twotimes with different participants, who arrived at varioustimes. The goal was to create a sense of arrival and connec-tion between the participants who had traveled for manyhours. We guided playful and collaborative dynamics, suchas simple breathing and movement patterns repeated inunison by the groups, as well as an activity of passing a hulahoop, which involved collaboration between participants.The sessions in Chilpancingo took place in the after-noon after the tribunal hearings. We offered one and a halfhour sessions, adjusting the time as needed in response todelays and changes in the agenda. We had between 7 and11 participants in each session. Some of them participatedin all three sessions in Chilpancingo, while others attendedonly one. Therefore, we created independent sessions thatfollowed almost the same curriculum but with small varia-tions in each. A few participants had already been exposedto corporeal practices, which was very helpful for theparticipants with less experience, and to us as facilitators.All the participants were adults and included a mixof genders. Most of them presented their cases to the tribu-nal audiences in the morning. They or their relatives werevictims of human rights violations, and some of themwere afraid for their family and their own lives. Otherparticipants were ITCPM staff members, who oversaw thelogistical aspects of the audiences, or artists, communityactivists, lawyers, and national and international judges.Generating a connection at the body level helped todecrease the attention given to differences in education,profession, gender, and the roles that people played at theITCPM. One female judge at the end of a session said:I have been sharing space with you during thelast days, but after this session I have a differentconsciousness about you, and I feel that we haveestablished a connection without words.For other participants, especially those who sharedtheir cases in the hearings, the sessions worked as a spacefor a partial recovery and a playful experience. One femaleparticipant said, I feel calmer now, and I have not laughedin a long time. Another male participant who gave testi-mony in the hearings said, This was a good space, but atthe same time weird....We made collective actions, and atthe same time we dedicated time to each of us.For other participants, the session was a space thatopened body awareness, body-mind connections, andcreativity. A male ITCPM support staff member said:I had the idea that to rest is to stop something, tosleep, or turn off the body, and through this exper-ience, I felt my body in a different way. When Idance or move, I realize that coming back to thecontainer of my body produces a change...such ashaving the possibility to see a problem with adifferent perspective.Three months before the ITCPM, we met with thepsychologists in person and by phone to share the goalsand content of each of our sessions and to find ways to collab-orate and support each other. As somatic practitioners, wefelt supported by the presence of three psychologists, whoprovided one-on-one counseling to those participants inthe hearings who desired it. Participants could choose toparticipate in the somatic group workshops or to receiveindividual psychological support. Some of the participantsin the somatic sessions decided to attend individual coun-seling the next day, and vice versa. The experience waspositive and enriched participants' options to feelemotionally supported during the ITCPM.",

We wereheartened by the positive reaction of the participants tothe workshops.

We were careful to expressat the beginning that they could choose to stop their parti-cipation in the session at any time if they felt uncomfortablewith it. However, nobody decided to leave. In addition, werealized that touch was something that participants werecomfortable with.

Therefore, it felt veryfulfilling for us to share this somatic support with a diversepopulation, including rural and indigenous participants.Following the ITCPM, we identified the need to providespecific workshops to relatives and victims in communi-ties affiliated with advocacy organizations interested incontinuing the somatic accompaniment.

Kitsou's credentials,unique in the field of choreography,include collaborations with NASA (viathe French grant Villa Médicis hors-les-murs) and the European Space Agency,and a long-term relationship with theSpace Observatory of the CNES (CentreNational d'Études Spatiales in France).In 1999, she received her doctorate inaesthetics, sciences, and technologiesof art from the University of Paris 8,writing her dissertation on dance inweightless states. Her dance worksexplore alternative relationships togravity, whether on the walls of build-ings, in water, using aerial apparatus,or in weightless environments. To date,she has embarked on twenty-one para-bolic flights and continues to createworks exploring weightlessness.Toni Craige and Adam Dipertare dance and life partners interestedin what humans can learn from zerogravity environments. Adam introducedToni to zero gravity dance through thebook Stardance by Spider and JeanneRobinson, and they have been dream-ing about it together ever since. Toni isa dancer influenced by contact impro-visation and Body-Mind Centering®,while Adam holds a PhD in physicsand is a professional circus performer.Since 2013, Adam's research into zerogravity movement has led him to writecomputer programs simulating thehuman body in weightlessness, speakat conferences around the world, andparticipate in two zero gravity flights.Adam teamed up with Allegra Searle-LeBel (U.S. national coordinator forWorld Space Week) to realize a shareddream: to bring the most experiencedzero gravity dancer, Kitsou Dubois,to the United States to deepen theirstudy of zero gravity movement. Kitsoutrained a group of dancers, includingAdam and Toni, in her work in zerogravity perception during a two-dayresidency hosted by the Smith CollegeDance Department in Northampton,MA. We had no idea how completelywe were about to get our minds blown.--Toni Craige and Adam DipertWho are we without gravity? How dopeople living in a gravitational environ-ment train to move without gravity?What aspects of our intelligence andcapacity can be accessed when we letgo of this primary orientation? Thesequestions and new ones were formedand redefined during our residencywith Kitsou. We found it fascinatingthat a training meant to preparepeople for zero gravity created suchharmony within ourselves on thesurface of the Earth. The feeling ofbuoyancy, ease, and groundednesslasted for weeks. Learning to move inzero gravity challenges fundamentalconcepts that we have about ourselvesand dissolves many habitual behaviorsdeveloped while growing up on thesurface of a planet. Following are someof the key concepts and approachesKitsou shared with us during herresidency.Movement in and out of GravityIn this context, zero gravity (alsoreferred to here as zero g or weight-lessness) is not meant metaphoricallybut literally. Zero gravity refers to thecomplete absence of gravitationaldirectionality. Iconic images of astro-nauts in zero gravity include those oflong hair floating freely in all direc-tions, people velcroed to the wall tosleep, and the use of sophisticatedtechnologies for simple things likedrinking water.To get experience in zero g priorto going into space, NASA astronautstrain on planes that travel in giant62 CONTACT QUARTERLY62 CONTACT QUARTERLYWINTER/SPRING 2020WINTER/SPRING 2020arcs, called parabolas. The parabolascreate thirty-second-long periodsof zero gravity, alternating withperiods of increased gravity. Kitsoureceived a grant in the early 1990s tostudy movement at NASA's JohnsonSpace Center in Houston, Texas, andwas awarded a residency in Londonfor two years (1999-2000) with theagency Arts Catalyst, during whichshe made parabolic flights with theRussian Space Research Agency atStar City in Moscow (a cosmonauttraining center) and with the Euro-pean Space Agency. She has sincebeen on twenty-one parabolic flightswith CNES and created many artisticworks based on her experiences. Herefforts have constructed a new viewof the human body and perceptualexperience released from gravity.The sensation of gravity actingon our mass is one of the primary waysthat we sense movement and theposition of our joints. Kitsou empha-sized that the initial experience inzero gravity is of having no bodyand being only eyes. According toKitsou, our individual lives as wellas the history of our species is aconstruction in relationship togravity, and that the experienceof flight in weightlessness is a veryparadoxical experience.... It's notsimply flying; it's something thatcauses a complete change in yourorganizational reference points.One way to understand the loss ofbodily awareness in zero gravity is toconsider our dependence on gravita-tional references, such as the tensionin our muscles, to develop a sense ofwhere we are in space. Without thisreference, our habituated mappingstrategies become inaccessible. Ofcourse, this zero-gravity-inducedanesthesia presents a challenge toskillful movement in zero gravityenvironments. To reconnect andorient to our environment, we mustfind new strategies for creatinginternal and external relationships.On Earth, we are strongly drawnto organize in relation to the surfacesthat we are touching (for instance,the ground, a chair, or a friend). Inzero g, we can have brief momentsof touching and organizing aroundother objects, but often we aren'ttouching any solid object. The slight-est push off a surface has a very largeimpact on the body. Dancers mustlearn to push and pull precisely andminimally to avoid chaotic, out ofcontrol movement. Kitsou spokeabout our tendency in gravitationalenvironments to spend our timepushing to move forward.... In zerog, you cannot do that anymore, andthat changes everything. She empha-sized the need to focus on supportinstead of only on where we aregoing: We really have to think aboutthe preparation; it's the anchoringthat we have to focus on. We senseda spiritual and cultural criticism inher analysis; we don't know how tobe centered, forgetting our ourselvesand our support in our constantpushing, reaching, and grasping.Kitsou said, On Earth, we spendour time avoiding the act of falling.As dancers, you're very familiar withthis. Because you go toward theground, you try to do so with fluidityand grace. Suddenly, zero g changeseverything because there is no longerany risk of falling. It's not about fall-ing well but about not falling at all.We actually feel safest and most athome when we are falling towardthe Earth. To not be falling is quitedisorienting. Zero gravity trainingshows us how profoundly we areshaped by our home planet and letsus experience what it's like to be afree-falling being, not in the sensethat we are falling freely but in thesense that we are, perhaps for thefirst time, freed from falling.Key Concepts and StrategiesKitsou's training emphasized aquality of quiet, precise centered-ness, with attention to the supportpoint of movement, using the body asa measurement tool, strengtheninginternal connections, and awarenessof the volume of the body and theenvironment.Quiet CenterednessIn the first exercise of the training,Kitsou organized the space like atraditional dance class--studentsspread out, facing the teacher, withbodies aligned to the architectureof the room. We began by standing,establishing our central axis andfeeling the flow or current of gravityin which gravity pulls in a downwarddirection and the earth pushes equallyin an upward direction. Tuning intothese two vertical energetic vectors,our bodies came into alignmentand released excess effort. Next, weadded a third direction by bendingour knees in a simple plié. Instead offocusing on the sensation of bend-ing in the knees, ankles, and hips,Kitsou's verbal cuing created a senseof extension into another spatialdimension with a quality of precisionand a heightened experience ofdistance.In another simple and subtlelesson, Kitsou taught a repatterningexercise for the eyes. She instructedus to turn our head and view theworld from our occiput, instead ofleading with the eyes or chin. Theresults could immediately be felt inour posture, balance, and vantagepoint. She explained that when weinitiate head turning with our eyes orchin, we tend to reach away from ourbase of support and destabilize ouraxis, which has amplified repercus-sions in zero gravity. However, whenwe turn from the occiput, we stay onour axis and see the world withoutleaving our support. The physicalsensation was of rooting the eyesdown to the feet through the path-way of the optic nerve to the backof the skull and through the brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheralnerves, down through the back. Inthis way, we remain calm, allowinglight to bring us information aboutthe world. This exercise alleviates thereach with the eyes, preparing us forzero gravity, in which even the small-est movements can be destabilizing.After establishing this quietlycentered quality, Kitsou asked us toperform simple movements of ourextremities, like lifting and loweringthe shoulders. Our tendency was tofocus on the muscular sensation inthe shoulders and to lose the sensa-tion of the feet and the current ofgravity. Kitsou instructed us to stayconnected to our support and axiswith phrases like keep the memoryof the foot and keep the flow goingfoot to head, head to foot. At first,this emphasis on sensing gravity andverticality felt odd in the context of azero gravity dance training. Later, wecame to realize that the training isabout finding something to organizein reference to while staying internallyaware and connected.Body as a Unit of MeasurementKitsou noted that seeing and turningthe head from the occiput not onlykeeps you centered but makes youaware of the space between yourbody and the point you are lookingat.... It's unconscious, but it sets thebody as a unit of measurement. Shesaid, In weightlessness, the ideais that the body itself is the unit ofmeasurement of the environmentthat you're in. In other words, it'sfrom your own body that you get tounderstand what surrounds you. Forinstance, Kitsou asked us to createcircles with our elbows, focusing noton the muscular sensation in theshoulders (the loudest sensation onEarth) but on the distance from thetip of our elbows to both our axis andour base of support (usually the feet).This strategy of shifting attentionto measurement rather than effortcreated spaciousness in the jointsand structural strength and clarity,while offering a non-gravitationalreference for organization.Strengthening Internal ConnectionsLater in the training, we beganorganizing internally in reference64 CONTACT QUARTERLY64 CONTACT QUARTERLYWINTER/SPRING 2020WINTER/SPRING 2020to forces from various directions.The first exercise in this vein was avariation on the spiraling rolls socommon in release technique andcontact improvisation training.One dancer lies on their back andreaches across their chest with anarm. Another dancer pulls on thearm such that the dancer on the floorspirals onto their belly. If the muscletone is too flaccid or too tense, thepulling dancer has to pull with moreforce. Dancers must create the rightinternal organization for the move-ment to be easy. There is a notion ofdistance and structure in the body,according to Kitsou. If the tone isjust right, it takes almost no effortto turn the body over, and the bodyis almost weightless. She explains,I'm going to give him an intention,but it's not me who pulls; it's whenI sense that he has connected hisspine that I insist a little. It's the twoof us, and at that point, you havealmost no weight.... It's not aboutweight. After establishing an abilityto connect our hand to our centerand move force through the body,we began initiating more complexmovements through the arm, suchas being guided in and out of thefloor and blurring the roles of leaderand follower.Our last session began with anexercise on creating internal connec-tions and a sense of volume. Onepartner stood still, activating thecurrent of gravity. Another partnerplaced a hand on the partner's bodywith the intentions of: (1) feelingthrough the structure into theground, and (2) applying no weightand no force. Both dancers wereto internally connect the point ofcontact to the ground through theirbody. Next, the active partner placedtheir other hand somewhere elseon the receiver. Both partners thenmade a connection between the twopoints of contact and between eachpoint and the ground. Sending infor-mation into structure without weightfelt like a tactile X-ray machine. Itreminded us of contact improvisationexercises, but the weightless handmade the connections on an ener-getic/awareness level rather thanthrough force transmission.Relationships between VolumesIn introducing her material on thefirst day of the workshops, Kitsoudescribed a progression from focus-ing on skeletal organization to theawareness of volume, because, inzero g, we have the sensation of adilation, a feeling of volume, thatwe have much less of on Earth.We are a human volume inside anenvironmental volume. How do wemanage to circulate the relationshipsbetween the different volumes?The main theoretical informa-tion on volume came while doingsit-ups as she spoke about usingvolume to orient the body. Orientingto volume decreases muscular effort!Kitsou had us focus our attentionon the relationship between ourvolume and the volume of space infront of and behind us while doingsit-ups. When we go to the front,we're going to open the space behindus, and when we go to the back, we'llcompress the air behind us.... Beginwith the organization of the body,and then you move on to focus on thespace. It's possible to find your axisbeginning with yourself, but you canalso find your axis starting with thesensation--no, not sensation--withthe awareness of the volume aroundyou. It's the volume around you thatgives the sensation of an interior,and the volume inside that allowsthe volume outside to exist; it's reallya question of constant interactionbetween these volumes. The ideabehind this is that you're never alone,you're linked to the environmentyou're in. Kitsou's choice of aware-ness rather than sensation here isemblematic of many aspects of hertraining. We learned to be aware ofthings that we cannot sense. Is thispossible? It's certainly paradoxical,and we believe we experienced theshift in awareness.Moving Forward with Awarenessand AppreciationSince our training with Kitsou, wehave continued our research intodance, perception, movement, andhuman possibility in zero gravityenvironments through the use ofpools, aerial harnesses, dance stu-dios, flotation chambers, parabolicflight, and other techniques. Main-taining the current trajectory ofspace exploration, more and morehumans will be spending time inspace, which would represent amajor transition for our speciesas a whole. The space industry isdominated by scientific research,militarization, resource extraction,and even tourism. We hope to useour expertise in embodiment, percep-tion, and purpose to contribute tohumanity's relationship with space.We are uniquely situated to thinkof space not as something to under-stand, conquer, or explore but asan environment that changes usand teaches us new things aboutbeing human.Thanks to Gaïa Maniquant-Rogozyk fortranslation and to Megan Robertson fortranscripts and translations. We aregrateful for Kitsou's profound teachings,and we appreciate that this work wouldnot be possible without the efforts of manypeople and explorers, past and present,both in dance and in the sciences.Moving and Thinking with FasciaInterview with Ray Chung on the intersection of fascia andContact Improvisation trainingHow do dance artists move with emerging21st-century biology?

Thefollowing is an interview I conducted withdancer and educator Ray Chung over emailduring research for my doctorate thesiscalled Interconnective (T)issues: BodilyExperiments and the Affective Entanglementsbetween Fascia Research and Dance Improvi-sation. Prior to this exchange, I had takennumerous classes with Ray in Berkeley andcrossed paths with him at the Fascia ResearchCongresses. I was interested in probing deeperinto the ways improvising with fascia hasallowed him to make new distinctions andnew bodily articulations that contribute to theemergence of his fascial sense-ability. Thesedistinctions also contributed to innovations intraining and teaching Contact Improvisation.Kevin: Perhaps we could start with the following questionto understand your history. Can you remember whenyou first started hearing about fascia in the dance worldyou are in? I frequently notice the concept floatingaround the Contact Improvisation (CI) community.What kinds of sensibilities do you cultivate in relationto it in your dance teaching and training?Ray: I hadn't really heard much about fascia in the CIor dance community until I started incorporating thatinformation into my own practice and teaching. I hadbeen reviewing material from the Fascia Congress inVancouver in 2012 and was inspired to include thatknowledge in my teaching, which already includedbiotensegrity and related info.In the mid- to late '80s, I had learned about fasciafirst-hand when I received the complete Rolfing seriesand started learning some of the techniques to facilitatemyofascial release.I feel that the awareness and perception of the movingbody is so heightened and enhanced through knowledgeand experience of fascia--from how it relates and isconnected to proprioception, to biomechanics, to my ownpractice of shiatsu and bodywork. Since I learned CI andshiatsu in parallel, I found many similarities, and eachpractice informed the other. Learning more about the roleof fascia in the movements of my own body and in how toconnect to other bodies through healing and dancing hasenhanced both experiences.Fascia is often called connective tissue--the viscous goop that connects, divides,and slides between muscles, organs, skin,and cells. It has also been found to beactive, intelligent, communicative, anda sensory organ; sometimes three, some-times many, and sometimes one; liquid,solid, and mucus. The scientific researchon fascia is still in formation, existing inwhat historian of science Thomas Kuhncalled a pre-paradigmatic state, in whichmultiple views exist simultaneously andwhere terminology and methods arein flux.What kind of practices have you cultivated to helpdancers think and move in relation to fascia? I amthinking about different scores in relation to fascia,but perhaps scores might not be the right word forhow you work with it.I guess the strategies that I use most in my teaching startwith learning about the physiology of the fascia--cells, gel,and fibers. I am focusing primarily on the gel, or groundsubstance, as a lubricating layer that acts as a cushionbetween one's skin and the underlying structure, noticingthe difference between compressive and shear forces asone's weight is transferred into the floor, and then howsliding or floating on the gel layer facilitates this transfer.In addition, I offer how experience of the gel can help onefall safely into the floor.A score I sometimes use is an exploration of waysthat fascia/connective tissue can provide support throughthe spine through the intention of reaching through thespine and limbs into the floor and into a partner's bodywhen finding/giving moving support. Playing with thedifferent intentions of pushing, leaning, or reaching givesan experience of how the fascia can be engaged to greateror lesser degrees, and how that facilitates more ease andefficiency when receiving and giving forces throughdifferent parts of the body.image courtesy R. ChungFascia is often called connective tissue--the viscous goop that connects, divides,and slides between muscles, organs, skin,and cells. It has also been found to beactive, intelligent, communicative, anda sensory organ; sometimes three, some-times many, and sometimes one; liquid,solid, and mucus. The scientific researchon fascia is still in formation, existing inwhat historian of science Thomas Kuhncalled a pre-paradigmatic state, in whichmultiple views exist simultaneously andwhere terminology and methods arein flux.1--Dumit and O'Connor, 2016BiotensegrityKevin: You bring in the concept of biotensegrity.What did this way of thinking about the body offeryour teaching that was different than what you wereusing previously?Ray: I had previously focused on the skeletal and muscu-lar systems more separately, and connective tissue hardlyat all. I had been focused on vertical alignment in terms ofstacked elements relative to gravity.Thinking more architecturally about the physiologyprompted me to utilize teaching aids in the form oftensegrity models and Chinese finger puzzles to model orrepresent connective tissue networks/sheathing aroundthe spine and other joints.Currently, I'm exploring how the skeletal, muscular,and connective tissue systems relate synergistically as atensegrity structure, which can act independent of gravity.How do you bring the concept of biotensegrity into yourdance practice? When is it useful to think with biotenseg-rity--for example, in weight-bearing situations? Andwhat in the model do you specifically focus on?An image I often use is swimming in your skin, wherean awareness of an articulation between the skin and theunderlying structure is mediated by the connective tissuegel, similar to floating on the gel. I use this in conjunctionwith the image of the bones suspended and floating inthe connective tissue network, all acting synergisticallyto mediate forces, gravitational or otherwise, that comein contact with the body, and how the body responds tothese forces. This is conducive to creating a sense of beingomnidirectionally responsive to forces coming fromanywhere, as well as creating a sense of lightness and easein movement. Consequently, as weight is introduced to apart of the body, the body reaches out to meet that force,rather than bracing or tightening.Cultivating Felt ImagesKevin: What are some of your techniques for traininga dancer to notice the difference between compressiveand shear force? Do you invite them to imagine the gel?Sense into it? What language do you use?Ray: I often begin with a physiological description ofthe components of the connective tissue (CT). The threeprimary components of CT being the cells (fibroblasts,adipocytes, macrophages, chondroblasts, osteoblasts),which provide metabolism; the fibers (collagen, elastin),which provide the mechanical properties; and the gel(extracellular matrix [ECM], ground substance), whichprovides viscosity and plasticity.Then I have students touch their own body structurebefore exchanging hands-on exploration of each other'sbodies, focusing on the viscoelastic quality of the fascia ona local as well as a global (full-body) scale. Locally, explora-tion involves pinching, pulling, rubbing, and sliding onsurfaces of the body initially, and then with the hands onvarious body parts. Globally, it's connecting the wholebody together through one specific point or small area asit's contacting the floor or a body and noticing how one'sbody responds as a tensegrity system. After some time,they work solo in relation to the floor, noticing how thegel cushions the bony parts of the body (back of the skull,elbows, sacrum, spine, scapula, knees, greater trochanter,iliac crest, etc.) and helps them experience the floor assofter and more welcoming as they move across, into, andout of it.The language I use is fairly descriptive, with someimagery but not a lot. Invoking the images of swimmingin your skin, floating on the gel, floating bones, is asimagistic as I tend to get.I think about shear as the thing that breaks tensegritymodels. I am interested in different strategies dancersuse to attend to shear force and perhaps change it so itcan be dispersed in their architecture. Can you articu-late how shear force feels different than compression?Shear forces are essentially sliding forces, or forces actingat an angle to a support structure. Compressive forcestend to restrict movement, whereas shear forces tend tobe conducive to movement. As I rest the back of my headon the floor, the main force I experience is compressive.As my head begins to slide (not roll), the sliding of thegel absorbs the shearing force into the surroundingtissue. The movement of the parts surrounding the gel(skull bone, scalp) tends to spread sliding forces into andthrough the gel. The viscoelasticity of the gel absorbs theenergy of deformation of the tissue by the weight or forcesacting upon it.I love the description of sliding or floating on the gellayer. Can you articulate what this might do or feel likein practice?The sensation of floating or sliding on the gel is not unlikesitting on ice and sliding on your bum when one falls tothe ice while ice skating. The amount of sliding is limiteddue to the fact that the actual slide is occurring within thebody rather than external to it. Due to the elasticity of theskin, the slide sensation is also partially the viscoelasticstretch of the skin, and the limit of stretch causes a dampen-ing of the slide to rebound in the opposite direction. Onecan play with the rebound and find a resonance withinthe viscoelasticity while moving in relation to the flooror a partner. This rebound is similar to the sensation oflanding smoothly and silently when jumping up from anddown into the floor repeatedly. The rebound can also aidthe movements, as the energy stored in the stretchingstructures can be released and redirected as the bouncingmovements continue.Floating Bones, or Fascial Sense-abilityKevin: You write above about fascia offering a differentway of being in relationship with others (and perhapsthe floor). Could you articulate how thinking with fasciaallows dancers to come into contact differently thanwhen thinking through muscles or bones?Ray: An increased awareness of the layer between theskin and the underlying structures can facilitate a greatersense of layers and levels of weight and touch. The transi-tion of forces from a localized scale to a more global scalewithin the body relates equally to another's body in thesituation of a Contact Improvisation dance. Connectingto other bodies on the layer of the fascia, and especiallythe gel, elicits a greater sense of fluidity, softness, ease,efficiency, and release in the joints. The image of the bonessuspended or floating within our softer tissue structuresis another way of thinking differently about the functionalrelationship between the bones and muscles. Especially asthe fascia is such an integral part of all muscle, one can'treally speak about muscle without speaking about fascia.This also speaks to how softer tensile structures liketendons, ligaments, and fascia can support weightwithout collapsing and are more adaptable to changesin direction, force, and timing--the omnidirectionalresponsiveness inherent in tensegrity structures.The fascia is the proprioceptive substrate of mecha-noreceptors. So in the case of proprioception, the sensoryelements are more diffuse throughout the body ratherthan localized around the joints.Also, the systems approach to the body as a syner-getic whole differentiated into various functional formsgives a radically different experience and felt sense ofthe body and how it functions than the more traditionalanatomical view of the body as individual parts assembledtogether. Emphasis is on integrity, continuity, connectivity,architecture, wholeness, rather than compatibility ofcomponents. Much like being waves rather than particles.Thinking with waves reminds me of the followingquote from Ludwig von Bertalanffy, founder of generalsystems theory:What is described in morphology as organic formsand structures is in reality a momentary crosssection through a spatio-temporal pattern. What arecalled structures are slow processes of long duration,functions are quick processes of short duration. Ifwe say that a function such as the contraction of amuscle is performed by a structure, it means thata quick and short process wave is superimposedon a long-lasting and slowly running wave.2As we dance and move through space interactively, ourwave nature overlaps and resonates with others reverber-ating and echoing off each other and the environment.Kevin: This reminds me of how fascia mediatesexchanges differently. I think of fascia as the materialof the middle (or of the relation). Can you give anexample of how attending to fascia changes the feltsense of a dance duet?Ray: The fascia has been described by doctor and medicalanthropologist Jaap van der Wal as the organ of innerness,an organ of connectedness.3A greater sense of permeability and diffusivity withinmy body is created when I attend to the fascia. This givesme a sense of a larger interior space, which provides moreopportunity for movement initiated from the interior,and thus makes me more available for movement andforces from the exterior to connect to my interior space.The interior space being not just the deepest innermostregions but also all the regions between the skin and thedeepest. Also, the experience of effort and strain is lesslocalized within my body and spreads out to more regions,giving the feeling that more of my body supports and isconnected to a particular effort or movement.I am interested in the play between reading texts onfascia, moving with them, and then returning to the texts.Could you give an example of how you do this? How do youknow when a practice helps you think with a concept?My guiding principle is that learning is experience,the rest is information. I think Einstein said this. Myintention is to create a frame, or points, of reference frominformation about the body. Then I would explore, or havestudents explore within said frame of reference throughmoving and attending to how they respond and adapt.In this case, information gleaned from research canbe used to narrow in on a specific frame. One example isfalling, and how the experience of moving through, on,over the gel reveals possibilities of how to relate andconnect to the floor, falling safely.There are usually overlapping frames of reference,since the body is always a frame as well. Another framethat I could be working with simultaneously is of tenseg-rity and how awareness of this architecture interplayswith the gel. I find it best to stick to one or two frames atany given time. After some period of exploration, a timefor reflection and inspection of the experience is articulatedin writing and/or feedback with another person. Then Irevisit the information in the text to see if my experiencecorroborates or contradicts it. This often gives moreinformation about how to proceed.One indicator of the success of the endeavor iswhether the process has been transformative for me. Haveany of my perceptions, viewpoints, or experience of myselfbeen transformed in the process?photo © Levi DershowitzRay Chung, Leviathan Studio, Lasqueti Island, Canada, August 2015.You write that in relation to proprioception, thefascial sensory elements are more diffuse throughthe body rather than localized around the joints. Doesattending to this sensory capability shift the timing ofa contact dance?Using the sensory information from mechanoreceptorshelps in seeing with and through the body. When thisinformation, along with the interoceptive, expropriocep-tive, and proprioceptive sense, is incorporated, I'venoticed there is a tendency of the experience of a contactdance to shift more into body time, which tends to feelslower than clock time. The more information processedat once, the slower time seems to pass.I am curious if you have thought of this in relationto mind or minding, or a more central thinking/dancing compared to a more diffuse thinking/dancing?I often consider conscious awareness and thought asmore central, and the unconscious as more diffuse, andoften experience my dancing this way. When I focus moreconceptually (space, time, relationships, composition),I experience dancing as more central. When I'm morefocused on sensation (weight, interoception), dancing isexperienced more internally and diffuse, in the sense thatthe whole system is in tune and humming along with nosingle aspect standing out more than another for verylong. I tend to correlate the central to external, and thediffuse to internal. In practice, the challenge is often howto integrate the inner and outer worlds, the central andthe diffuse aspects or qualities of our awareness. Is itpossible to be in both or must we oscillate between the two?I think, especially in the context of performance, thatthe integration of these aspects is essential, as there is somuch that happens beyond our conscious awareness andcontrol (the diffuse thinking), and our conscious aware-ness (the central thinking) can attend to only a few itemsat a time. Having an economy of consciousness is helpful,while trusting that the diffuse bodymind is able to takecare of survival, technique, sustainability, etc.Historian of the body, Shigehisa Kuriyama, writes abouthow our concepts of the body pull along a certain kindof self. For instance, he traces how the emergence ofmuscles in ancient Greece pulled along the idea of a trueGreek man, with muscles as agents for autonomous will.Could you describe the kind of subjectivity that thinkingwith fascia pulls along in Contact Improvisation?As my body is more than the sum of its parts, the contri-bution of the various bodily systems creates a complex,elaborate, and synergistic experience of wholeness,coherence, coordination, and integrity, as I am not ableto functionally isolate systems from each other. As theorgan of innerness, fascia provides me with more ofa sense of connectedness between the outside and theinside of my body.Compared to former knowledge of the body, sincethe time of the Greek muscle human, current knowledgecontinues to provide novel images and experiences of thebody, such as the tensegrity human. Thus, the shift fromthe dualistic worldview of the body composed of partsmaking a whole organism to the complex view of the bodyas differentiated from a single whole into functionalsystems that interact synergistically. From this evolvingframe of reference, current concepts of the body continueto transform and affect my sense and perception of move-ment and embodiment as well as my practice of ContactImprovisation.Water Play: Change Gravityby Petra KuppersAs a disabled dancer growing older and (in my case)heavier, CI can get hard. At a certain point, my personalratio of muscles to weight meant that many moves wereoutside my reach. Traditional CI jams with jumping folkswere becoming dangerous to my slow floor being, withmy wheelchair by the side of the dance floor. I still love thesmaller CI jams, the listening-to-skin ones, the juiciness ofslowness. One of my ideal jams is the Oakland-based AXISDance Company's annual jam, which brings togetherpeople with a wide range of mobilities but (often) withdecades of practice in listening bodily and being withone another.Since it hasn't proved easy for me to change my bodyand its pain levels, I changed gravity instead. Now, I oftenmove in or lead contact sessions in water, and a whole newrealm has opened up. If you haven't yet, try it...have yourjam in the pool.1. Find warm water. Some like to engage in communalcorporeal listening in a freezing forest. But for most ofus, a warmer environment is kinder to our muscles. Seeif there's a therapy pool somewhere: it's fun to remakea therapy site into a creative adventure. The deeper thepool, the better. Then there are sun-warmed summerlakes, sweet inland oceans, or saltwater expanses. Oneof my cherished water-CI memories is moving withdisability dance elder Emery Blackwell in his hot tub inEugene, Oregon.2. Bring goggles and nose clips. Don't forget the nose clips:it's not so much fun to get water up your nose whenyou flip. Listen, lean, and enjoy the pull of water around you.Contact elementals. Familiarize yourself with your nerveendings blooming into the warmth, into the liquid. Feelyour blood. Have a small dance. Feel yourself in contactwith your first partners: your spine, water, and air.4. The starting position for muscular movement is differentfrom traditional land CI openings. Instead of back-to-back and reach-across rolling contact, you will likelyneed more leverage to go under and find movementimpetus. Sometimes when contacters move in the poolfor the first time, I notice that buoyancy can be a chal-lenge, and the dance stays at the surface. To get intoall dimensions, here is a useful starting exercise: Oneperson stands solidly grounded in the pool. The secondperson takes a breath, goes down, and holds on to thefirst person's leg at the pool's bottom. Then, the secondperson rolls forward into the liquid, using the otherperson's leg as fulcrum. The first person pays attention,ensures there's no panic, helps to provide anchor. Glide.Expand. Touch. Alternate. Sense. Offer yourself forweight and buoyancy. Stay curious to what happens.What is contact here, in the water, when weight andmomentum follow new rules?5. Your breath comes naturally. The most importantmovement rule of underwater CI: no leg kicking (ouch).6. Listen. Stay tuned to the elements and each other.Wonder. Let the breath be your guide.7. Water is life. See how water CI influences your landpractices. May the contact field of relations widen:who protects our air, water, earth, land, and bodies?Give thanks.And then you say, so what's the message, and I say I don't know.Usually I figure it out right at the second I arrive.It appears in my mind right at the second I arrive.Like the message is something that was entrusted to me by something that didn'twant me to know it until I was here.And you say, sort of like a security system, and I say, kind of.Also like a game or like just old manners.Just the way things are done, you sayAnd I say yeah, just the way things have always been done.And you say I've been waiting for you to arriveAnd I say how did you know I was comingAnd you say, I've been sending signals.And I say sending signals or requests?And you say that in a way they're kind of the same thing, but no, signalsAnd I look at you and you say, signals so someone would know I was here.And I say that's how they must have known you were here.At this point, we understand that it's time to start the observations.We line the room with custom.Things ring and shine.Are you ready?I say.Are you ready?You say.We close our eyes and wait.I think nothing is happening but it's hard to tell.You're not real, you sayAnd I say, what? and you sayYou're not real, I made you, with my mindAnd I say that's not true. Try me.And I say, and anyway even if you had made me with your mind, which you didn't,it still wouldn't mean I wasn't real because you would have made me and things thatare made are real that's a rule about reality: it's what gets made.(I sleep, dreaming I'm awake, then wake up in mydream and dream I can't sleep.Then I wake and can't sleep.)You get very close to me and say into my ear that youwant to take me to the cosmoplane wall, that it will curemy sleeplessness will I please let you do it.And I have always wanted to go to the wall--But I say: I hear the wall is no good this time of yearYou have to go in the right seasonor it's impossible to see.You won't see it and you will glide right pastInto endless space never to return.And you say, those are just storiesAnd I say, those are true storiesAnd that I know at least twenty assorted who have goneto see it and never returnedAnd you say, well maybe they justdidn't want to go backThat's not proofBut I say, it's proof enough for me.Then you tell me, be quiet.Because the wall's right here, towering above us.The wall's right here, you say.And you can see it if you open the right part of youreyes.I don't have a progress report to give. It's one ofthose long stretches when nothing happens visiblyin the astrogarden. I'm letting the last blooms taketheir decay plumes at negative three and I can't getout there and rake until the decay is complete or atleast in its last sixty-fourth. Meanwhile I'm hopingno space trash--you do occasionally see it even thisfar out.I haven't made decisions yet about what to plantfor the next calendrical observations. It's a fallowperiod. It's impossible to mark progress in a fallow.You're either in it or you're not but there isn't ametric for its duration or a way to note its slope.One day you plant and then it's over.Everyone has their own approach to the mysteriesof creation. That's mine, bordering on a kind offaith in the lined interior of boredom. I'll take thefallow voluntarily. But also I'm going fallow becausethe next observations are for the Battle of Rabbit'sBluff, the most important battle and the hardest tounderstand. Honestly it's intimidating in a way thatmakes me freeze up. I don't know how to do a cliffand a drop and a tundrally tunnel in non-obviousways. So far the only thing I've figured out is that itall needs to be icewhite with only halos of greenand pink, so momentary you almost think youwere mistaken in identifying color at all. I'm unsurehow to produce the tones I want: a blood pink, amournful green. It's hard to make that feeling comeout of those colors without just tipping stupid andgarish. I'm sure most of the memorial gardens willbe in the standard black with silver dust and pinkfestoons, but I see it icewhite.But that's all I see. Formless color. So I'm training onthe dances while I wait to see more. I found someold instruction pamphlets from before they startedmaking the instruction holograms. I recordedmyself reading them so I could dance along to myrecording without having to keep looking backat the paper. I like it when someone leads me aslong as it doesn't go all the way to manipulation.Suggestions, invitation, subtle coaxing. Leave mea little room to follow you in. I'll play one now. Ifyou're listening, you should practice. There arehologram tutorials in all the ship banks that you canwatch if these instructions don't make sense.I've been thinking about the memorial dances andif they would also be meaningful to me if they wereadvance memorials for myself. Are they letters foryou or are they advance memorials to myself, likeletters I'm leaving for myself as if I'll be able to readwhen I'm a ghost just a decay plume slowly dilut-ing down to a remnant crystal of fine minerals thatwon't travel? Anyway.Listen.But when it calls, stop talking.It will stop calling if you try to capture its voice.If the loon calls out, don't try to record it.You are falling down along through the hole.And you are.Particle pinpoint precipice floating party. The vastness is.And some things go on ending while others do not.Here's where it splits.And now that you are gliding the hole, you still don't know because it is lightless, it is the end of all things.Where one thing gives way to another.And all those years.All what years?All those years.You never knew what thing gives way or what it gives way to.Down a hole which is a tunnel which is a slide which is a place.Backed up into it, against my will now I find myself falling backwards.Some part of you will know: this is the hole.You will try to reinstate the old habits but you won't be able to.You have to be backed up into it, against your will.Every movement you make looking like the others you have made.The hole is a hole in this consistency.That's what you have to imagine.You can't get to Rabbit's Bluff by thinking it, by wanting it.And if you were to aim into it, cut into it, slice the wind in order to navigate.To not be buffeted.What would that even look like?Are there drifts, is there a cosmic wind out here pushing us off course?And you wonder is there variation or slow progression or is it endlessly recursive?Everything you say now is a recurrence.You can hear water lapping though you're not near a body of water.The hole is not a circle.Why should a hole take the form of a circle?But you do imagine it that way.You imagine it in the limited way you have for imagining things.CQ 44Borne on the winds of the '60s counterculture, a generation ofaspiring Western concert dancers like myself took on the task ofreimagining the codes of our trainings. How did we want to live inour bodies? What kind of body did we want to cultivate? How couldwe speak and listen to our bodies in a gentler way? How could wechange the language and landscape of our oral tradition? How wouldthis translate into performance?Rooted in the necessity for invention, improvisational dance, inmyriad forms, emerged as an excavating tool for these questions andhas been developing on the sidelines of mainstream dance culturefor half a century now. Little did we know in '75, when the ContactNewsletter was born as a grassroots networking and research ragand then, barely two years later, slid so gently into being a vehiclefor moving ideas for a much wider conversation on improvisationaland somatic approaches in the field, that the embodied languagingwithin its covers would become an archive of a paradigm shift inthe art of dance. And here we stand.We never dreamed we'd stop the press on CQ as a biannualjournal for reasons other than economic unsustainability in the guiseof rising printing and mailing costs. However, with a shift in theneeds and energy of your two dogged and largely volunteer coeditor/publishers (Nancy and I), we hasten to look for ways to continue ourmission (read our statement on the back cover!) . And right beforeour eyes are the dynamic opportunities of web publishing. While thethought of moving online once felt like a defeat--of print, that is--it now beckons a renewal that will foster fresh formats for participa-tion and expand our collective imagination into new communities ofreaders and contributors.Within my body, CQ has always been an adventure into theunknown, a dance with survival, an artists' project, a collaborativebody of work that requires regular recommitment. As we take ourfirst step into new territory with you, our readers, your embrace ofour mission will be felt through your continuing dialogue with thematerials we scribe in our collective body's memory.Thank you for your abiding support during this transition.Lisa NelsonMight the family of movement artists who have gatheredaround CQ 's watering hole over the last 4.5 decades and youngerartists setting off in new directions want CQ 's vehicle for movingideas to stay on the road and serve and swerve? Might there beexcitement for a newly hatched CQ , one that is beyond what we'veimagined so far?The arrival of new forms and structures for CQ 's continuity willbe influenced by many factors, including YOU. This coming year, manyforces will be interacting to reenvision CQ , including our brilliantadvisory board and an engaged group of editor-dancers. Openingthe space for radical change is a hugely generative, difficult, hopeful,practical, scary, and exciting time.Our first step, to give us time to reinvent ourselves, is two-pronged. Next issue, our 45th Anniversary issue (!), will be the lastprint journal of the current incarnation of CQ . Concurrently, we'll begreatly expanding our online publication--CQ Unbound--with adynamic collective of former and new editors.We hope you'll stay with us--as subscribers, writers, donors--and be part of this monumental turning.I stand with the Rabbit and the Muffin (see photo)--betweenthe already and the not yet--on the bluff, doing the Small Dance ofbalancing with gravity, letting all the dances I've ever had and willever have make a new, complex, indecipherable movement, one inwhich all is in motion and at rest. Unspeakable home.*Nancy Stark SmithArtist Statement:My practice is based in black studyand a desire to occupy performance.i use performing as a vehicle to undo, reorient, andblur conceptions of subjectivity,whether as a black subject, or in any subject/objectrelation.i do this with the presence of an audience in mind.creative processes and works are fugitive practices,like strategic scaffoldings building upon each other.they fabulate against time to question ritual v.performanceand they consider the presence of locationfor generating escape hatches from consumption.location might mean the performance site (and itshistory),the archive (and its limitations),or circumstances of contemporary life (and theAnthropocene).collaboration is always present as a desire and meansfor worlding these abstractions.collectively, the contours of these settings becomefigured and real,and negotiating these connections is how i think ofthe choreographic--as playfully untethered to the corporeal so to besomehow everywhere but nowhere.--Jonathan GonzálezIn late November 2018, I witnessed a version of JonathanGonzález's work cancel as part of Riff Talks_07: TippingUtopia (a weekend of performances, talks, and workshopsproduced at the School for Contemporary Dance andThought in Northampton, Massachusetts). The followingday, I took a workshop led by Jonathan where we listenedto the space and each other, practiced breathing as an arcbetween two deaths, looked at maps of Western Massachu-setts from various authors and periods of history, and wenton solo sound walks through the neighborhood, which wethen transposed back into the studio space in simultaneouscacophony. In early February 2019, Jonathan returned toNorthampton and the School for Contemporary Dance andThought to perform as part of the HUT series (co-curated byJake Meginsky and Jennifer Polins). I sat on the floor close toJonathan and witnessed as they read text speaking of matri-lineal ancestry and relationships from their cell phone. I sattransfixed, listening to the creak of Jonathan's brown leatherpants and boots as they oscillated thickly in and out of thefloor, lights rising and fading all the while. My three briefencounters with Jonathan's work caused me to lean in andwant to be in dialogue. The following are traces from oursubsequent email conversations.--Meredith Bove, CQMeredith Bove:I'm curious about notions of sight, the unseen, and/or partialobscurity in your work. Both performances I've witnessed byyou have taken place in environments where the audiencehas to work to actually see the body, to have your body comeinto visibility. Are you interested in the sensory tuning thatmight occur when vision is obscured (for instance, height-ened auditory sensing)? And/or are you interested in usinglighting/darkness as tools for challenging histories of perfor-mance where the body is typically on view or available forvisual consumption?Jonathan González:There's a lot to riff on inside of opacity and the situationof staging, the stage, and being staged, as William Pope.Lsays.1 Let's talk about the theater and theatrical event asa physical and psychological apparatus where the socialnegotiations of being together come with all the baggage ofits containment, while simultaneously having the potentialof suspension and of falling apart. I am speaking alongsidethe Western classical innovation of the theater and thepurpose of culture-making as a measure of indoctrinationand as a vehicle for institutionalizing ideals of civility. Andthen I am taking that a step further to deal with blacksubjectivity and fugitive practice--or methods of being inthe world that elude whiteness through fabulating othermatrices of being and black enclosures. Part of fugitivepractice is to choose marronage2 from hegemonic societyand to reorient to that traditional container and how wesituate ourselves within it. In this way, performance per-forms outside of the theatrical arc, as it decenters yourgaze or my gaze or the performer via an audience gaze--no one object is primary and there is no singular meaning.Instead, the potential in performance is that no one isautonomously a voyeur or performer; you as an audiencemember are also witnessed and implicated in the unfold-ing narratives, as is the performer. This bears importanceto me since I am thinking of the stage as being locatednowhere as a poetic apparatus, and yet everywhere aspraxis. We are performing beyond the theater itself. Thisalso feels essential, as fugitive practice is aligned with howI compose performance--meaning how the creative processstrategizes processes of labor and how the material arrivesin consideration of an audience, with the flexibility tochange in real time.In the theater, and in the general construction ofperformance, that material stuff of seeing and being--the collaborative and potentially antagonistic, eroticumbilical thread of being and being seen as a performerwith audience--that stuff is generative and essential towhy I recognize performance as a funny word. Perfor-mance is a vehicle I return to when thinking of sociality,of living at all, and composing. Like this past summer,2018, I was an artist-in-residence at NARS Foundation3thinking through what the referent of a white box studiospace and object-oriented practice of exhibition couldmean in relationship to these questions. My studio wasa 10' x 8' open-air space, and it became a locus for all mymaterials, including my body. Gradually, the floor becamea tarp-covered dance floor as I painted the walls withmotor oil, lacquer, and compost. These materials traveledfrom the surface of my skin, leaving traces from eachmotion of those choreographies made in that place. Thecircumstances of that austere white space and I startedto duet, and I desired to know how those corporealdevelopments could remain, in the visual sense. Thisfelt necessary, and playful too.To get back to my point on the spectator-performerinterrogation, the public exhibition that closed my resi-dency came, and I was troubled with how to represent thistime of creative enclosure and precarity into an isolatedobject in the main gallery. It didn't make sense to leave thesite. We, the architecture and I, had wrestled to encounterthose grounds of intimacy. Similarly, I recognized how I waswrestling with those familiar constrictions of blackness,and my allegiances to black-being, in the entanglementsof notions of abstraction. So the work, cancel, developedas a performance without a body present, accessible toa viewer only by peering through a peephole drilled intothe adjoining wall. It was marketed as a performancenevertheless, with the scent of soil, sweat, and motor oilaccessible through the peephole too. I reference Jab Jab,a long-standing tradition charting the arrival of slavesto the Caribbean and the establishment of the annualfestival, Carnaval, in which performers cover themselvesin motor oil and chocolate and carry raw meat in theirmouths to physically animate the devil they were deemedto be by the slave masters--and see, these folks celebrate.This is costume, or armor, and it's not for white people; itfunctions to create enclosures where whiteness could beunrecognizable and illegible. This was my referent for themotor oil in cancel.Those who visited shared the effort to see the figura-tions the choreography demanded upon their eyes, andthe metaphorical thread of the peephole to intrusion andthe erotic. Most importantly to me, the labor of witnessingmade the spectator complicit in how they identified thematerial, as much as their relation to consumption of thework. Fugitive practice is about evading capture, and thestage is an iconic site of capture. I'm thinking aboutJosephine Baker, Nina Simone, Robert Johnson...the listof black artists who have been consumed by the stagecould go on....So, what I'm trying to get to is the performance as amechanism of intervention to get down to the subalternatelevel, or that place that is also labeled through the work ofFred Moten and Stefano Harney as the undercommons4--the situation of black life and the material capacity ofblackness that resides under these hegemonic structuresby choice, like the underground railroad.The material capacity of blackness is to say thatblack-being and blackness are not the same. Blackness isnot about the racial demarcation of peoples by pigmen-tation. Blackness is the set of virtual, cultural, and socialnegotiations constructed around and through acts ofappropriation, affecting those people who are black,resulting in the circumstances of a social death. Therefore,black-being is the people, and blackness is not predicatedon the body or presence of a body. A dear friend of mine,Victor Peterson II, would call this place the black vector,naming blackness as an entry point of virtual consider-ations.5 Blackness is a material reality, a performedreality, which is galvanized under numerous streamsof commerce, with appropriation being only one kind ofexchange. The stage as a place is trapped in this consump-tive feedback loop of taking from blackness--from cool,from a posturing, and desirability of the virile--ratherthan from black people.The issue I am approaching is how to be inside thecircumstances of performing in the social sphere, inwhat W. E. B. DuBois refers to as double-consciousness.And then, being involved in the circulation of creativework for performance when I understand that both5 Victor Peterson II, Raising Pure Hell: A General Theory ofArticulation, the Syntax of Structural Overdetermination, andthe Sound of Social Movements (research project, Departmentof English Language and Literature, King's College London).spaces--the social real as well as the stage--are predi-cated on a zero-sum game--blackness being the site ofextraction with no reciprocity.That extractive feedback loop, the act of taking withno reciprocity, is something we also identify with in ouranthropocentric relations to the earth--our ideas of whatthe earth might be. Therefore, we can identify a threadbetween the lives of those considered zero, or blackpeople--also to say the compound of peoples who nego-tiate the duress of capitalism and the white imaginary(or the public secrets engendering a dominant culturalnarrative)--linked to the site of the earth. It is necessaryto consider that the gendered representation of the blackfemale is always the primary site linked to the earth.I'm thinking of the story of Marie-Joseph Angélique inMontreal, referenced in Katherine McKittrick's DemonicGrounds, in which the slave Marie-Joseph Angéliquechooses to burn the site of her home where she is anenslaved groundskeeper in an attempt to flee to freedom.She burns down the entirety of downtown Montreal inher second attempt and is found in the deep woods beforebeing taken to be publicly lynched. See, she and the landare in collaboration to be free, and both suffer an insur-mountable ache to be released in that Nina Simone, IShall Be Released provocation to a realm beyond whiteimagination. I recognize that performance can access thisspace, if only during the interims it intervenes upon oursocial negotiations, for a poetic articulation of the wallscome tumbling down.Many of my works are made in darkness or high-intensity light, or include costuming with lightingapparatuses affixed to the performer rather than the rig.This is notable in Obeah, Lyric baby, and ZERO. In ZERO,the performer Rena Anakwe traverses the stage in a bub-ble, lit by dim hues of cerulean, magenta, and green. Thissolo is act three within a four-part work that premieredat Danspace Project in NYC in 2018. Rena is costumedin a sound-light activated wearable bodysuit enclosed ina bubble containing water 12 deep. The water has beentreated with liquid that illuminates under UV light toreveal a sky-blue tone at her feet. Act three is an articu-lation of water and bioluminescence, but we ended upcalling it the Cosmic Wail. ZERO was made in an effort toresearch the architectural history of St. Marks Church asa slave-trafficking quarters established by early settlers ofthe Peter Stuyvesant congregation. In ZERO, we approachthe notion of a liturgical mass in reference to the foundingof the church as Episcopalian, to undo the sanctity ofthe sacred space, and to reveal the controversies of itsinception. Rena's recitation of the black spiritual Go toSleep, Little Baby becomes a gesture for those enslavedwomen who labored as wet nurses on the second floor ofthe church each Sunday during mass--out of sight, butPerformer Rena Anakwe in ZERO, Danspace Project, NYC, 2018.within ear shot, as the ledger states. Within this bubble,Rena becomes synonymous with the shadows and thesounds of other women through vocally synthesizedmanipulations, and a metaphorical mother to thechurch-space trapped within this superficial bubble.I think of obscurity and cannot help but think of thelantern laws in the post-antebellum Northeast UnitedStates, above the Mason-Dixon line when freed blacks weremandated to carry lanterns after dusk in order to be iden-tified. Bodies in shadow became synonymous with objectsof light. There is something poetic and real about this.Illegibility is a source in my work because it isrooted in a desire for other kinds of legibility to emerge.Making work with this demand is generative, and it is alsoan escape route--a hatchway through the performancein real-time toward another site of potential. Illegibilityserves as a way to encounter being both with and againstan audience; against agreed socialities and representa-tions sometimes named the white gaze; against canonsof artistic production prescriptive of an idea of us, whichis black first. To be clear, I'm not gesturing to a kind ofAfro-future, or site for utopia, or cathartic release; it'sabout presence and being present where I am with anaudience in the exchange, to fuck up the time continuumas it relates to certainty and consent not to be a singlebeing,6 as Fred Moten's text is titled. I'm thinking andpracticing through these ways of working where, inperformance, there's the material of a reality, and thematter of change, and the situation of an audience,and the notion of a between us. Each feels essential.Meredith:I experience your work existing on/in multiple time scales;as a viewer, I have felt invited to drop into time outside ofwhat I experience in my everyday. I feel invited to considerhistory and lineage, and to cultivate an awareness of whathas/might have come before the performative momentthat I'm witnessing. I also experienced some of these ideasembedded in the workshop I took with you in November--theconsideration of layered histories existing in the body andin the present moment, and how cartographic practices areone way to re-chart some of the histories that are present butnot named. Any of this resonating?Jonathan:All of it resonates. I have a question for you: How doyou know when you have recognized the aesthetic orconceptual proposal for a future in a work? What doesthe possibility of futurity formalize in performance?Meredith:I think I begin to perceive a proposal for futurity in a workwhen I see dismantling or critique of established norms,whether performative, social, etc. This might be formal,messing with expectations of time or action within theperformative event, or messing with space and being seen.When an artist is working against conventions that havebecome wrapped up in generalized audience expectations,which over time have perhaps become subconsciously codifiedinto some kind of unspoken yet internalized performativeagreement (e.g., audience will come; they will witness amoving body; there will be a beginning, middle, and end;viewers will be invisible/anonymous; there will be legible orrecognizable devices for producing meaning/feeling that wealso experience in movies, theater, music, etc.), then I feel aninvitation to consider what else is possible, and this invitationto consider what else is possible orients me to futurity.Because of this disruption of expectation, I experienceproposals for futurity in works that make space for  failure,in works not meeting standards of performance that havebeen inscribed and reinscribed by consumers and artistsin the performance marketplace. Performative momentsthat fail to live up to established expectations force me as aviewer to confront my own internalized, normalized valuesystem, and make space for something else to take root. Ialso think there is something about work that exposes griefthat invites futurity for me. I think the act of grieving andacknowledging loss, suffering, and violence allow for movementtoward an imagined elsewhere. Lack of acknowledgmentand lack of grieving make for reproducing the status quo.Jonathan:Hmm. I'm really taken by this--acknowledgment of self byinviting grief, and grief as a measure to move towardvisioning futurity. There is a way that grief in our puritani-cal construction resembles oversharing and a tumultuousslope to ineffective emotional responses. That might becapitalism more than puritanism, but they seem to becollaborating. I agree, and am always trying to orientpleasure and dynamism of experience in each work as away to know grief as a site of nuance and plurality. Grief isthe bearing of our everyday. It reveals our holistic capacityto be alive outside the bounds of utility to each other. Toinvite grief in these ways allows me to contemplate apraxis of composing and living with and againstindoctrinations.Do you think the circumstances of the stage continueinto our everyday? Is surviving a practice?poemPloughing, opening grooves across the land,turning the soil over.Shattering its unity, its coherence,its compactness. Crumbling it.Like in a paced and forever slow churning,blending air within it,heavens introduced into the ground. The soilmade foam.Ample and light, vibrant multiplicity,assemblage of infinitesimal curds.Leibniz's sea, but made of earth:I like the example of the roaring noise of thesea that acts on us when we are standing onthe shore. To hear this noise as we do, we haveto hear its parts, that is the noise of each wave,although each of these little noises makes itselfknown only when combined confusedly withall the others [...]  1Ploughed, the ground that appeared as a sealedplane on which to stand sprouts into volume,texture, juiciness. It breathes. It promises tobear fruit.In the freshly dug gap, seeds may nest.In its aired thickness, roots may grow.Water and oxygen circulating in the porousdepth of the soil, they find space and nurtureto expand.Dancing requires ploughing. Turning the insideout. Churning the sedimented compactness,shattering the established surfaces that delineate,enclose, separate. A place. A moment. People.A self (an I).Dancing means furrowing. Opening. Groovesafter grooves, across and into the givenness thatis the ground we stand on. Mixing up, blending,the inside, the outside, the self, the other. Ploughed,contours acquire volume, entities acquiremultiplicities, borders sprout into foamy thickness.Ground is no more one ground, but a sea, expanseof smithereens, a chorus. Interpenetrated streamsthrough which fertile promises circulate.Multi-headed, the course of events pulls forward.Dancing, I yoke myself to it. Attention is the plough-share's edge. Attention is that which penetrates andcuts through. Cutting not to separate, but to makeway. To diffract the givenness and call for thepossibility of movement, circulation, connection.Let them flow through, impregnate, imbue theporous now.With the compactness of self crumbled, a mushytexture arises. Events take root.Dancing, ploughing the situation I am made of,I may be an erect groove, a granular openness,welcoming movements, being a nest for themto grow. Dancing, I may be a field, a place forthe space to resound, an environment for theenvironment to bear fruit.The sun hits hard. The sea is dead flat. Monotonous whispers. No wind. Sweat is streamingdown the man's bare body. He is a king, yet behaves as a mad peasant. Vulnerable and pitiful.Palamedes, emissary of King Agamemnon, looks at him, the sovereign of Ithaka, naked,working in the peak of the heat. Painfully trying to plough a forever unproductive land: theshore, made barren by the sea. The ploughshare manages only with difficulty to open groovesinto the ground, as it is yoked to the mismatched pair of an ox and a donkey. They pullclumsily, with uneven power and pace. Moreover, what is sown in this impossible field issalt, only salt, handfuls of it, sparkling when thrown in the air, just before spreading in animmaculate but mocking constellation on the dark soil.Palamedes needs this man, Odysseus, the wisest of them all. Kings Agamemnon andMenelaus need him. Heroes Achilles, Patroclus and Ajax need him. They wait for his wit, hismeasure, his command. His armies. They have to sail together to Troy. A war must happen,the city must burn. But what to do now with this fool?Soon, the emissary grows doubtful. Is this scene for real? He goes to the king's palace,finds his way to the sleeping baby heir--Telemachus--and brings him to the improper field.Placing the boy in the trajectory of the plough, he then sits. He observes the heavy hoovesand sharp ploughshare approaching the child, round as a fruit.The sun's incandescence, the relentless repetitiveness of the surf, the sweat dripping fromthe king's body, the effort of the animals, the open rocky soil, the salt crystal seeds, the babypeacefully sleeping a few steps away from possible death, threatened by his own dad. I wasdurably marked by this scene since I first encountered it as a child, reading it around eight ornine years old in Contes et Légendes du Monde Grec et Barbare, in the very same volume thatmy dad had been reading at the same age some decades earlier and that I read to my sonnot long ago.It all works around mismatching. The episode draws its potency from the display ofpowerlessness. The barrenness of the land, the inappropriateness of the effortful labor, thevulnerability of the powerful, his insanity--he who should be a guide, the exposure finallyof a defenseless young life that should thrive. It is a spectacle of the unproductive, thenonfunctional, the misfitting. All the more expressive in that it is set up around the cultivationof that which should allow life to be sustained and to prosper--crops. And it is all the more aspectacle indeed, that it is all a pretense. As Palamedes suspected when bringing Telemachusto put the king's alienation to test, Odysseus simulates in order to avoid joining the war.No doubt, this story speaks to me of art. The cultivated madness, trustful in a laborthat goes nowhere and suspends functionality. The celebration of the mismatch, the lastinginsistence on that which doesn't work.Andreï Tarkovsky's final movie, The Sacrifice, dwells amongst similar tropes. A patriarch and hisyoung son, the urge to avoid a war, the performed madness, and the efforts to cultivate what isirredeemably unproductive. The opening of the movie shows a man, the father, on a shore. Heis planting a dead tree with the affectionate help of his seven-year-old son, who is mute for thetime being as he recovers from surgery. In the last scene, at the very same location, the boy isnow alone, bringing with much effort two full buckets to water the same forever dry tree, plainlyerect in front of the expanse of sea. His dad has just been interned in a psychiatric hospital, as,in a sacrifice to God he can't explain to anyone, he burned down his own family's house andrenounced speech, so that the Lord would prevent a terrifying war from bursting out.As ignorant of his dad's motivation as unperturbed, he trustfully and stoically carries onthe unproductive gesture, the dedicated care for that which bears no fruit. As the camera pansto the dead branches appearing dark against the shimmering light of a sea goldened by the sun,we are left with a picture reminiscent of traditional Japanese prints, bathed as it is in a mutingand perennial sobriety. In our minds though, we are still contemplating the potency of thecultivated madness the dad transmitted to his son. The madness that grants meaning to thatwhich makes no sense and hears the promise within that which won't flourish.I walk across the neat corridor, leaving behindthe large changing room and its pungentenvironment of sweat smell, impressive andexotic testimony of the realm of adulthood. I mustbe eight, my outfit feels large and stiff. I turn to myright as I reach the double door, I stop just pastthe threshold. With straight legs, feet together andarms along my sides, I bend slightly forward. Now,I may step into the room. Four, five steps to theright and I stop again. Foot to foot, arms to sides,I bend. Now, I may step onto the large field ofgreen and orange tatamis, arranged in an amplyelongated rectangle. An open field for our training,a sublimated battlefield for the craft andphilosophy of fighting, evolved as an art of Lovefrom the fury of the Middle Ages' killing--bladeshitting armor, swords sneaking into joints toopen up the flesh, the blood flowing and taintingthe soil.Bowing. Bowing to space. Inscribing intothe body its preeminence, through a gesture ofdedication transmitted for ages from God knowswhen. To endow, physically, experientially, aportion of space with a singular potency. Iremember feeling impressed by the responsibilityof paying this tribute.In no other circumstances in my life back thenwould I be instructed to acknowledge that whichbrings neither fun nor profit or progress. In noother circumstances would I be led to attendto a meaning that escapes functionality orpleasure. With a plain, stoic matter-of-factness, Iwas inscribing myself again and again into space,thereby addressing it as an active presence thatmatters, worthy of deference. It felt weird, it feltright. It felt exciting. Honoring too. Time andagain astonishing. It felt like opening up to themore than myself. It felt like dancing.field within a fieldThe notion of field readily evokes an open array for the possible to emerge and unfold,a fecund territory for the imaginable. But what lies behind this common metaphor?What are its implications? Taken as a stretch of land cultivated for food, field bringsabout sensuous associations of smells, turned-over soil, and exposure to weather. Butit sits also as a figure of major cultural importance as it reminds us that our entiresedentary civilization rests on it. Besides, if it is a place for crops to grow, it is also, inbattle, one for corpses to fall. The site that welcomes the prosperous development ofthings does equally host their perishing.A step into an open-ended inquiry on these questions, this folio is conceived in thewake of a performance research on space and places--on how we inhabit them andhow we are inhabited by them in turn. With the practice of inviting space to inviteoneself at its heart, we are exploring what it is to inhabit our lived experience, toinhabit the places where we conduct our dedicated craft as artists and, finally, to inhabitthe environments we belong to.This interrogation is pursued here on expanses of white paper through the figure ofthe field--a way to think and feel our entanglement with space, as dancers, as people,as beings. Composed of three movements--one that celebrates dance's fecundity, asecond that faces the barren as an access to art's potent impotency, and the last thatpays homage to a seminal experience for the author's love for dance--this publicationoffers itself as a constellation of echoes, frictions, and juxtapositions: a field of relation.SomaticCostumesA Teaching Resource andPerformance Generatorby Sally E. DeanIn 2011, I began exploring thepotential of costumes as a bridgeto translate somatic practices intoperformance. A key moment of theproject's creation occurred while Iwas living in Java, Indonesia (2007-2008), and dressed in the traditionaldance costume, the kain, which is along cloth tightly wrapped aroundthe legs and pelvis and secured by astagen, a sash, also tightly wrapped--this time around the waist, betweenthe pelvis and the ribs. This costumerestricted the movement of my legs,kinesthetically containing my mid-to lower body. I'd witnessed thisquality of containment in the dailylife movements and dances of theSolonese in Java, but I wasn't able toembody it myself until I tried on thecostume. The costume's sensorialexperience--rather than its aesthetic,symbol, or meaning--was a portalinto new perceptions for me, chang-ing the felt-sense of my body. Thisexperience instigated the followingquestion:How can costume stimulate newmovement vocabulary or qualities thatmight be missing from a performer'srepertoire?What developed and continuestoday is the Somatic Movement,Costume, and Performance Project,an ongoing collaboration with costumedesigners Sandra Arroniz Lacunza(Spain), Carolina Rieckhof (Peru), andmyself (US/UK), in which we designSomatic Costumes™ to instigate kin-esthetic awareness in participants/performers.For example, we designed theBalloon Hat to elicit the experience ofthe buoyancy and volume of the skulland the Bin Bag Skirt to enhancethe lightness of the pelvis and itsorientation to the sky. These SomaticCostumes have led to performances,talks, workshops, films, and more:2017's collection of Somatic Costumeevents--Portals of Perception--included an artist residency at theLondon Contemporary Dance Schooland Dance Research Studios; a lectureand experiential talk at the LondonCollege of Fashion's Design for Perfor-mance and Well-Being Research Hubsas well as at the Wellcome Collection,through its Open Platform event; anda performance at the BirminghamArts & Science Festival. The SomaticMovement, Costume, and PerformanceProject based in London builds onmy ongoing cross-cultural collabo-rations; my somatic practices; andmy last twenty years as a performer,choreographer, and teacher livingUK.This project integrates foursomatic practices that I have studied:Amerta Movement (JavaneseSuprapto Suryodarmo), SkinnerReleasing Technique (AmericanJoan Skinner), EnvironmentalMovement (British Helen Poynor),and Scaravelli Yoga (British GiovanniFelicioni). Each somatic practiceinstigates psychophysical awarenessthrough different focuses: AmertaMovement combines imagery, environ-ment, and ritualistic sites from Java;Skinner Releasing Technique usespoetic imagery; EnvironmentalMovement accesses the outdoor envi-ronment of south-coast England; andScaravelli Yoga integrates externalbody forms with internal sensationand imagery.Over the years, the SomaticCostumes have developed in twoways: as a somatic teaching and as aperformance practice. As a somaticteaching resource, I offer workshopsto dancers, theatre practitioners, andcostume designers, in both universityand professional contexts, to open upthe under-explored relationship betweenbody and costume. As a performancepractice, the Somatic Costumes becomethe starting point for my process andmaterial. Performance pieces emergefrom an improvisational relationshipwith costume, in which costume isa co-collaborator in the experience.Instead of starting with an idea or aconcept, improvising with the costumeitself--listening and following its ownintegral being--leads to an unfoldingof style, character, and movementquality, as well as images and themes.Somatic Costumes become the teachersand the choreographers in this project.The value and resource of costume inboth somatics and dance are not just inits visual aesthetic but in what it doesto the body while wearing it--its tactile,kinesthetic sense.Costumes are portals of potentialand perception. What we wear affectshow we move, think, and feel, as wellas what we create and perform. If Iwear stiletto-heeled shoes, I walk inan entirely different way than if I wearheavy combat boots--the experienceof my feet and how I walk will change,including the character and who I amperceived to be, both on the inside andon the outside. If I change what I wear,I have the power to change what I feeland think. A perspective can shift simplyby putting on a different hat. Howmight a costume not only instigatepersonal awareness but also createsocial change through choreographicpractice? I offer people somaticacts--performative invitations intothe somatic experience of what theywear--as experiential exercises.Somatic Act 1Wherever you are, take a moment toclose your eyes. Sense your contactto the floor, or a chair. Notice yourbreath--your breathing. Taking a fewmoments simply to inhale through thenose and exhale through the mouth.Notice that your costume is touchingyou, and you are touching your costume.Allow time.Choose a coat to wear--one thatyou haven't worn for a long timeor have never worn before. Witheyes closed, slowly touch it.What is it like?Is the texture soft, smooth,coarse, slippery, stiff? Now smellit. Pause. Does it make sound?Take time to explore it, followingyour sensations. Pause.Now slowly dress yourself.Allow the coat to dress you. Howdoes it rest on your body? Howdoes it touch you? Is there asense of weight, compression,or lightness? Slowly open youreyes and continue with SomaticAct 3.Somatic Act 3Close your eyes again and slowly,following your sense of touchand sensations, take off yourcoat. Sense the transition as thespace between the touch of thecoat and your body increases.When the coat is no longertouching your body, notice whatyou experience. Can you sensean invisible costume? Slowlyopen your eyes.What did you experience?Somatic Act 5Find two big baking potatoesor two smooth stones aboutthe size of your heart or fist.Place either one stone or onepotato over your heart, as youlie on your back on the floorin a comfortable place andposition. Close your eyes. Noticeyour breath, the inhale and theexhale. Notice that the stone/potato is touching you and youare touching the stone. Restfor 5-10 minutes. What did younotice? What sensations arise inthe chest area?Act 6Find masking tape, a blackmarker pen, and a partner,and return to your two bakingpotatoes or stones. Write on thepotatoes something you wouldlike more of in your life andsomething you would like lessof. Ask your partner to tape thestones or the potatoes over yourheart on the front and back ofyour body. Be dressed witheyes closed. Take your time--notice the transition.Then, once dressed, slowlyopen your eyes and take a veryslow walk around your home insilence. What do you notice?Act 7Take off the costume of yourstones or potatoes with the helpof your partner--slowly, witheyes closed.Once the costume is removed,slowly open your eyes. Go foranother walk.What did you notice? How isyour breath? Can you sense theimpact of the costume on yourchest? How do you feel?Can you sense your costume rise andfall with the breath? Can you senseweight, texture, constriction? Whatdo you notice? Allow time.Place your hand on your belly. Allowthe breath to deepen there. How is yourcostume touching your belly or yourbelly touching your costume? Is thereelastic around the waist, or a tightlyheld button? How does this affect yourbreathing? Rest for a moment...Costumes as a Somatic TeachingResourceWhat are you wearing today?Tight leggings, a baseball cap, aloose-fitting dress? Have you everthought that what you are wearingcould change you--not just in the wayyou look to the outside world but alsoin how you feel, think, move, dance,and perform?When teaching, I often share thisexercise with participants: Pick orcreate a movement combination (itcan be very simple, based on specificeveryday movement, external shapes/forms, or internal qualities/imagesyou embody). Do it three times, butchange what you wear each time.Try wearing a winter coat, high heels, adress. For example, when wearing thestagen, participants begin to noticethat balancing, such as tipping offthe vertical, becomes easier. Or that along skirt with a lot of material, whichcreates momentum, allows one tospin faster.Costumes become part of ourbodies in our everyday life and in ourdancing--a second skin. Not onlydo they become part of us--they pro-foundly impact how we dance/move.While witnessing a dancer/mover,I look for what is known or moreunknown in her or his movements.This might be body areas, qualities,images, characters, and so on. Forexample, a participant might not beaware of the movement potential ofher or his fingers when she or he moves.To support this person, I would offerwearing Feather-Fingers to facilitateor initiate finger movement. Or ifthe weight of the pelvis or tailbone ismissing in the participant's aware-ness, I might offer the Hula HoopPelvis Skirt or the Furry, Water BottleTailbone Belt. I also find that partici-pants tend to have habits that theyare unaware of--for example, movingtheir arms with a sudden light qualityabove their head. Dressing participantsin costumes that awaken this habitoffers them other choices. I noticethat in somatics, choreography,and improvisation, we often involvehuman touch to bring awareness topeople's bodies, but the costume'stouch is underutilized. The costumecan help us enter into the nonverbaland move beyond the visual realms--through the tactile.Somatic Costumes as PerformanceGeneratorsThe costume has a life of itsown. To sense this, I often begin bytouching the costume with my eyesclosed in order to experience thequalities embedded in the material.During improvisations with SomaticCostumes, I have noticed a tendencyfor participants to follow certainaspects of the costume. They mightfollow a sensation, image, or charac-ter (there are infinite possibilities).Where and how they place theirattention in what they follow createsthe aesthetic of the work. For example,if I put two people in the Bin Bagcostume, one person might follow therustling sound of the costume andthe other might explore an expandedbody volume. What a participantfollows creates the relationshipbetween their body/movement andthe costume/material along with thechoreographic material generated.Following is one method of respond-ing to an aspect of the costume thatI have developed into a performancepractice. I specifically use the wordfollowing--a starting place of listeningand receiving--so that the participantdoes not relate to the costume as anobject to manipulate but rather as aco-collaborator in the dance. Thecostume moves you.EpilogueAs I write, I am wearing mySomatic Costume of Lentil Socks,socks filled with dry lentils. I do thisbecause I know it affects how andwhat I write. It's a conscious choice--what Alva Noë calls an action ofperception--along with how I sit onthe chair, the particular chair I sit on,and where the chair is located. I amin relationship.I am choosing these Lentil Sockstoday because once I am at my computer,this relationship affects my eyes. Myeyes reach toward the computer screenand I lose my peripheral focus (ornon-cortical gaze--a way of lookingthat is not about naming, accordingto somatics theorist Hubert Godard).Instead, I accentuate my cortical focusand heighten my concentration in thedirection of producing words, losingthe layers in between. I am writingand seeing at a particular distancejust to the edge of the computer screen.Kinesthetically, my fingers type,creating a particular rhythm andmovement. This frames and createshow I move and what I write.I would like more choice. Thesocks, filled with lentils, respond tothe tiniest of movements; like sand,they shift when I shift. A slight move-ment of a toe, and the lentils respond,adapting to mold around my feet intheir new position. The movement ofthe lentils awakens my feet, creatinga quality of massage with their small,hard, smooth texture.

Curated andorganized by MCA's Associate Curator of PerformanceTara Aisha Willis, the event brought together Bebe Miller,Ishmael Houston-Jones, and Ralph Lemon for the firsttime as a trio in two improvised performances in theEdlis Neeson Theater.The following text originally appeared in a bookletpublished on the occasion of Relations, which also includedwriting by Claudia La Rocco, titled BebeIshRalph.Sections of the text have been edited and excerptedfor this article.The full booklet is available online as a PDF athttps://mcachicago.org/Calendar/2018/11/Ishmael-Houston-Jones-Ralph-Lemon-Bebe-Miller-Relations.--CQ edsPart family reunion and part-first time encounter, they[Ishmael Houston-Jones, Ralph Lemon, and Bebe Miller]pay homage to their past selves, gesture to the futures ofdance that they have inspired, and testify to their present-tense artistry. These longtime peers, friends, and icons havenot shared a stage since the early 1980s, when Houston-Jonesorganized a series of solo and duet performances highlightingthe then under-discussed intersection of black choreographersmaking non-mainstream dance. After nearly 40 years ofinfluencing each other from afar throughout their prolificcareers, the kinship between Houston-Jones, Lemon, andMiller unfolds in real time on the MCA Stage in two bare-bonesimprovisations that bring together each artist's living,embodied archives and their individual relationships toperforming and making dance.[from the press materials]IntroductionTara Aisha WillisRelations grew from a brief conversation with IshmaelHouston-Jones (b. 1951), both of us exhausted anddowning coffee while I described what I felt was my thennew curatorial responsibility: crafting how the Museumof Contemporary Art Chicago's Stage season influencesthe performance canon, while staying true to my beliefin finding unexpected ways to declare our relationship towhat precedes us. I asked Ishmael how he felt about beingasked frequently to perform his early works or speakabout experimental and improvised dance in downtownNew York in the late 1970s through the 1990s. Was it becausehe is one of the few black dance artists from that sceneand we are in a moment when history and the present are,rightfully, being examined for unconsidered perspectives?I told him that I see him as a forebearer of my practicesas a dancer and curator, among artists including BlondellCummings (1944-2015), Fred Holland (1951-2016), BillT. Jones (b. 1952), Ralph Lemon (b. 1952), Bebe Miller(b. 1950), and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar (b. 1950). Ishmael'sresponse, like his improvisational performance style,was indirect yet practical: You know, I've never actuallyperformed with Ralph and Bebe. I'd love to do that. ForBebe, Ishmael, and Ralph, though the historical andcultural contexts around their work over the last fortyyears require attention, even intervention, more crucialis the present. So, what if the answers to my questionsaren't in a history lesson but a performance? What if theonly way to understand the past is by looking at the artists'bodies at work today? Improvisation is a strategy forperforming and making dances at which these three areexperts, and improvisation has been integral to their workfrom the beginning. Improvisation can be trusted to bringout who they are and what they do--their tics and habits,their past work balanced on each flick of an arm with theimmediacy of responding to the moment. Though they havenever danced as a trio before, since that first conversationwith Ishmael we have all imagined Relations as a reunion.With shared history always just under the surface, theirinventing a dance together in front of an audience iscompletely new yet completely familiar territory....We could mythologize them: Ishmael the punk, forwhom labels like black, queer, or experimental dancearen't limits so much as malleable tools; Bebe the linguist,overlaying multiple articulations of her relationshipto dance, culture, and society, and trusting what thatintricacy unearths; Ralph the double agent, posing big,poetic questions while adroitly dodging answers in favorof something less nameable. But the possibilities withinthese improvised performances on the MCA's stage hingeon the intimacy, often at a distance, of their relationshipswith each other, not on those imagined figures.Among only a few choreographers of their generationand ilk who continue to make work, their relationshipseems as much about mutual artistic influence as it isabout friendship. I have looked to each of them as guide-posts for what dance can be, what choices black artistscan make. We are not starting from scratch in thecurrent dance landscape when we ask big questions byexperimenting with dance, in part because these threehave already been in conversation for a long time, alongwith many others. As Ishmael, Ralph, and Bebe navigatetheir craft together, Relations continues that conversation.EXCERPTS FROM CURATOR'S STATEMENTFOR PLATFORM 2012: PARALLELS,DANSPACE PROJECT, NEW YORK1Ishmael Houston-JonesI chose the name Parallels for the series because while allthe choreographers participating are Black and in someways relate to the rich tradition of Afro-American dance,each has chosen a form outside of that tradition and evenoutside the tradition of mainstream modern dance.... Thisnew generation of Black artists--who exist in the parallelworlds of Black America and of new dance--is producingwork that is richly diverse. [from the program notes forthe original 1982 Parallels events]So it was in 1982 when I was newly arrived in New Yorkfrom Philadelphia where I'd performed with Group MotionMedia Theater (a company led by two former membersof the Mary Wigman ensemble in Berlin) and studiedimprovisation with Terry Fox, African at the Arthur HallAfro-American Dance Ensemble, modern (Horton) withJoan Kerr as well as contact improvisation and onesemester of ballet. I asked Cynthia Hedstrom, the directorof Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery,if I could curate a series composed of a group of Blackchoreographers who were working outside the mainstreamof modern dance. All those definitions seemed so simpleto me then. To me Blacks were the descendants of WestAfricans who were brought to the Americas as slaves inthe 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. They may or may nothave voluntarily intermarried with Native Americans orless voluntarily interbred with the majority population.They were all freed by the end of the 19th century butsuffered discrimination in the form of Jim Crow laws andthe inability to vote or to use the same public facilities oracquire equal education as the majority population. Theycould not marry whomever they wanted, and they sufferedreal violence and death in the struggle to correct theseinequities. They also invented Spirituals, Gospel, Blues,Jazz, and Rap. That's who Black folk were to me then. Idid not consider folks from other parts of the Diaspora:not the Caribbean and no, not Africa.What was beyond the mainstream was somewhattrickier to define. The Judson Dance Theater (1962-64) isusually cited as the watershed moment in dance historywhen traditional concert modern dance gave way to aperiod of more experimental post-modern dance, withMerce Cunningham seen as the intermediary figure.However, most often in the history of the Judson erathe contributions of Black experimentalists are eitherinvisible or relegated to a footnote of the more seriouspost-modern choreographers....In Merrill Brockway's 1980 Dance in America PBS specialBeyond the Mainstream, the only non-white person whoappears in the hour is Kei Takei. Were there no AfricanAmericans working beyond Brockway's mainstream?Ditto for Michael Blackwood's 1981 documentary, MakingDances, featuring the work of Trisha Brown, Meredith Monk,Lucinda Childs, David Gordon, et al. (Blondell Cummingsis seen performing in a clip of Monk's Education of theGirlchild [italics added for emphasis].) This same cast ofchoreographers, with a few variations, shows up in SallyBanes's 1982 book Terpsichore in Sneakers. Apparently,in a dance movement that began in the impassioneddefiant days of the 1960s and proclaimed from the stageand in manifestos that dance was a democratic form foreveryone, everyone was a rather limited concept....It's been thirty years since Blondell Cummings, FredHolland, Rrata Christine Jones, Ralph Lemon, BebeMiller, the late Harry Sheppard, Gus Solomons Jr., and Iperformed on the first Parallels series at Danspace Project[in 1982]. It's been twenty-five since Jawole Willa Jo Zollarjoined us on the Parallels in Black tour to Paris, Geneva,and London. Now Bebe, Gus, Jawole, along with DavidRousseve, Cynthia Oliver, myself, and others, are on thefaculties of major university dance departments. In thefirst Parallels series, I was making the case that to be acontemporary Black dance maker, one did not have tobe a direct descendant of Ailey. We were coming fromCunningham, Nina Weiner, Monk, Contact Improvisation,as well as African and American Black Dance traditions.Now many of those traditions are part of the moderndance canon; dance students have been exposed to thoseforms and to us as teachers....As the African American choreographers of my generationhave continued using their progressive ideas to make newworks and to disrupt the canon, whom can we identify asthe next generation who will wreak havoc on the status quo?ISHMAELRalph LemonShaman.

St. Mark's Church, Danspace Project. I meet IshmaelHouston-Jones. What a name, Ishmael, like from Moby Dick,Melville, I think to myself. He calls my dance, Wanda in theAwkward Age, from 1981, a black dance, and I tell himthat that is absurd. He says that it is OK that I disagreeand asks me to be part of an event he is curating atSt. Mark's Danspace, called Parallels. A grouping of an(imagined) black downtown dance community, seven ofus. He was feeling lonely, he said. Sure, why not, I said.and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar are all here. I'm captivatedwatching the whole show from offstage, everybody's verydifferent dancing points of view. Offstage (every night)Ishmael seems to be yawning, or not watching at all. Ican't take my eyes off his dancing. He scares me a little.I don't understand why he dances the way he dances, likehe's mad at somebody, with an odd kind of grace.1987. Rimini (the place where Fellini was born).

    "content": "letter to a young artist....My humble advice, because I am older and you areyounger, don't be so self-conscious, vain. What's up withthis generation and its narcissism? It's what's inside, but youalready know this. It's also about getting so deep in the workthat your body disappears. It's about the work, brother, notthe fucking beauty. Making work where you are too confidentin how good, smart, contemporary, transgressive the worklooks--seems--is a mistake.When you start to become too self-conscious, just think ofIshmael, he was inside a fucking garbage bag (unseen) for anhour and it was the best moment of the ten-hour marathonat St. Mark's Danspace (the Parallels redux) in 2012, let'snot forget.Can You See How I See?Bebe MillerHumans are built on memory. We build our place inthe world through how and what we remember. We movethrough the events we encounter according to our habitsand perceptions, ricocheting and navigating through thefamiliar and unfamiliar by way of constant sensory infor-mation. We organize faces, postures, our relation to theweather and the political climate, aligning ourselves tothe interior catalogue of events that we collate andregenerate through the course of our lives.Dances--and dancers--are built by humans. The layersof remembered events we pass through daily become thefascial matrix of the form of the body, the form of an idea,form itself. We remember remembering, and find ourselvesyet again at a point of becoming. Memory is the container;remembering is the action. For me, choreographing seemsto be a way of revisiting small events in some weird,made-up way. I'm less interested in coming up with adifferent ending or turn of circumstance than in thechance to recrystallize a fleeting encounter. I stop timelong enough to read it from the inside, from the flesh, froma distance. I fact-check my attention, choreographically:what's the rhythm, where's the focus, what's the nextmove, what can I interrupt.Watching dancing goes along with making dances.The first time I saw Ralph Lemon dance (in the early1980s?) he was maneuvering a flat cardboard car in theCunningham studio in Westbeth, New York. I think he waswearing glasses. I also wore glasses, but it hadn't occurredto me to dance with them on in front of people. He put onekind of motion next to another (also) in ways that hadn'toccurred to me. I felt a certain relief that he (also) did notseem to be translating a perspective assumed to be forblack people. I enjoyed not knowing why he was doingwhat he was doing. I received it, didn't try to explain it,and kept an eye out for what else he might do. When I firstsaw Ishmael dance (also in the early 1980s) he was wearingan animal; perhaps he was also wearing his combat boots--I can't quite recall. He had worked up an intensely personaland pungent state that was mesmerizing. He moved wildlyand carefully, and there was a hint of Twyla Tharp along-side the bushwhack--pretty terrific. I hadn't seen anyonebecome that transported since dancing during Yorubabembé ceremonies in Queens in the 1960s.My reason for dancing is because of what it feels like.I place one arm in time and space, check it against anawareness forming in another part of my body, note whatI attend to, and proceed to bend, redirect, interrupt thereferences that rise up. I rearrange sensation, image,according to the form that emerges. I follow the timingbetween gestures, the tell, the rise of attention betweenpeople, the toss of their weight, the offhand smirk of ashoulder held in place a bit too long. Dancing holdsmany moments I've walked through before, but it's theirrearrangement rather than the retelling that most interestsme. What I remember, what I carry with me, is what Imeasure the present moment against.Earlier in my career, when I began to realize thatpeople were paying attention to these dances we weremaking and coming back more than once to see what Iwas up to (even though I wasn't sure what I was up to),I was regularly asked about what perspective on theAfrican diaspora I was sharing. Clearly my tellingneeded some translating. How to answer that?Elaine Summers (1925-2014) was achoreographer and founding memberof the Judson Dance Theater. Her perfor-mance work was presented at the Museumof Modern Art and the GuggenheimMuseum, at the Lincoln Center Out ofDoors festival, and throughout the world.She was founding director of severalorganizations, including the ElaineSummers Dance & Film Company, theExperimental Intermedia Foundation,and the Kinetic Awareness Center.In the 1970s, she began developingand teaching Kinetic Awareness® (KA), anapproach to somatic education with broadapplications for both performing artistsand the general public. KA includes avariety of awareness-based techniques,such as placing rubber balls under variousparts of the body to provide contact withinner sensations. Practitioners of KA exper-ience enhanced awareness of inefficientmovement patterns and psycho-physicalpatterning, creating space for healing,change, and choice. KA was the basisof training for dancers in Summers'sexuberant intermedia projects.I imagine that each person whoworked closely with Elaine Summershas their own version of her. In mymemories of Elaine, she is a guideleading her students toward innerrealms, where, like archaeologistson a dig, we explore in fine detail themysteries of our bodies. In her role asguide, she is free of all agendas savea generous, listening presence. Sheexudes a deep respect for our unique-ness as individuals, sitting besideand supporting us as we delve intothe aliveness of our moving bodies.Through her words and quality ofpresence, she guides us in a practiceof noticing: our emotions, memories,and the evolution of ideas withinour flesh.As I write about Elaine, I becomeentangled with my former self. ThoughI worked with her intimately from1978 to 1983 and beyond, I did notknow Elaine like she knew me. In ourtime together, the relationship wasalways about me. I trusted her com-pletely, and because of this, I learnedto trust the truth of my body, senses,and movement.When I began working withElaine, I was hungry: a young,searching artist yearning to createoriginal work. I was also in physicaland psychological pain. My kneeshad been swelling regularly sinceadolescence (I was put on pointesince age 8), and I had suffered lower-back and shoulder blade pain since1974. Emotionally, I was strugglingwith issues of self-worth tied topersonal, gender, and cultural historyas a Puerto Rican woman, and I wason a quest to decolonize my body/mind/psyche from assumptions andpatterns (subconscious/habitual)of thinking, being, and moving thatblocked inner knowledge. Elaine'sprocess of Kinetic Awareness per-fectly matched my needs. It meldedsystematic study and training of thebody with artistic praxis, teachingme how to develop my artistry whilesimultaneously healing physical andpsychological wounds. While workingwith her, my repertoire of movementexpanded exponentially as I investi-gated embodied phenomena such asbody image, frozen tension--twoof several names Elaine used to referto particular psycho-physical states--and inefficient movement patternsarising from various emotional states.Kinetic Awareness and improvisationbecame central practices in my questto develop movement forms thatwould express my reality as a PuertoRican woman.Elaine's approach empoweredme as an artist because it allowedme to integrate healing into mycreative practice. Kinetic Awarenessinitiated me into breathwork andsomatic awareness practices thatbecame entry points to the energeticdimensions of my body. This was myintroduction into mindful movementas a basis for cultivating the wholeself, including personal, anatomical,physiological, psychological, chemical,electrical, and spiritual dimensions.Kinetic Awareness and improvisationbecame tools for accessing my bodyas teacher and healer and for harness-ing the wild complexity of mindfulembodiment within a life in dance.I first met Elaine in 1978 as aCETA1 dancer with the Cultural CouncilFoundation. I had been assigned to dancewith her in a series of performances ofher work Illuminated Workingman (1974),which took place in NYC parks. Therewere several other CETA dancers, andI remember the performing experiencewas unlike any I had had until then.While Elaine was wildly enthusiastic,her process was chaotic. She wouldchange unison movement for a largegroup section moments before theshow, leaving dancers confused andunable to achieve the intended unison.But it was enormously fun. One of herdancers, Tedrián Chizik--a performerThe studio is a large open space, with white walls and nowindows. There are containers with balls and large blocks of foamcovered with faux fur blankets. Grab a blanket from a pile, and one ormore balls, find a spot on the floor and lie down. Close your eyes andbreathe, sensing into the body changes as you drop your weight ontoa ball, letting go. Scanning through your body, each breath bringsmore and more sensations into awareness. Sensing your weightcontouring around the balls, how much of your whole self canyou feel--the joints, bones, pulse, breath, muscles, skin? Play withsounding the breath, allowing/sensing the vibration of the soundand breath to reverberate through your tissues, sensing this particularrelationship of body parts in space, release into gravity. The chorus ofsounds and dancers moving ever so slowly on the ground supportsthe process.Elaine makes her way around the room addressing eachstudent: What are you working on? She gives you her completeattention, making suggestions for how to work toward a particulargoal--find articulation in the lower back, release tension in theshoulder, connect through the legs, etc. After 30 to 45 minutes ofworking individually, we transition into working on letting the bodystretch itself, a practice of following minute impulses in and throughthe body to move into extension. What does it mean to let go? Tofollow the body's impulses? We always start slowly, deliberately,articulating and becoming aware of every body part's engagement,Dancing with Elaine (cont'd)using as little tension as possible. Adding extension tension takesus into release, which brings speed, momentum. We let the pulsingenergies and rhythms of extension and release move us throughlevels, space, and working with each other. In between extendingand releasing, leading and following, we experience being dancedby forces of movement, sound, and weight. Surrendering to themovement and the moment, the energy builds. The body and voiceare freed. I experience kinesthetic and aesthetic delight, surprise,freedom, and connection. Healing.Sometimes the experience is slow, dark, emotional. You closeyour eyes and tune into your sadness, anger, pain, or fear of lettinggo. Breathing and moving ever so slowly and attentively, I realizethat I am able to release a bit of this, one breath at a time, or throughthe sounds I am making. Elaine encourages us to stay with whatevercomes up--emotional release and expression are an integral partof the quest, mission, or commitment to creating dance art andbecoming fully human. We practice allowing emotions to movethrough us; attentively aligning layers of experience (movement,shape, emotion, sound), we engage in their artistic expression. It'sOK to cry as long as you keep working. In this process of embracingpainful feelings, I discover that they no longer cripple me but, in fact,help me grow, fuel the work. Healing.In private sessions, we worked with light and color. In thisenergetic/spiritual work, she would ask me to close my eyes andsense my pulse or my breath, and then to describe the experience.If I reported sensations of rhythm, color, and light, she instructedme to breathe into the experience, give into it, and direct it to thethird eye or brain--an initiation into light work, expandingpossibilities. Healing.uand children's theater director whohad studied and danced with Elainefor many years--extolled the depthand transformative power of her work,which persuaded me to study with heras a way to heal my aching body.Elaine was, first and foremost,an artist. She applied her artisticphilosophy, burnished in 1960s experi-mentalism, to investigations of thebody and movement. Prior to myworking with her, she had been activein generating democratizing ideas andforms as a member of the Judson DanceTheater.2 She was a strong advocate forwhat she called the rainbow range ofmovement possibilities and aesthetics.The ethos of her kinesthetic investi-gations echoed Judson peer YvonneRainer's manifesto that no one thingis any more important than any other.3Elaine privileged no single way ofmoving over another, nor did sheconsider any body part to be moreimportant than another. This commit-ment to a democratic view of the bodyled her to explore diverse approaches topresenting bodies both through liveperformance and on film. Beginningin the 1960s, she worked freely acrossmedia, and in 1968 she founded theExperimental Intermedia Foundation,which is still active today.In her Kinetic Awareness anddance improvisation classes in thelate '70s and '80s, Elaine regularlyposed the question, How does yourbody (head, hip, shoulder) want tomove? For me, a dancer trainedin old-style pedagogies of classicaldance requiring students to move inways designed by others, Elaine'squestion presented a revolutionaryproposal that both baffled anddelighted me while opening up newpossibilities for creative experimenta-tion. I experienced it as an invitationfor me to enter the singular kineticconsciousness of my unique body.Elaine encouraged us to observe,without judgment, the experienceof our bodies moving of their ownvolition. We understood that in KineticAwareness, the mind's job was todirect the body to move and observeits corporeal unfolding. This practice,like phenomenological and Buddhistpractices I would encounter laterin my career, demanded sustainedattention to present space/time,supported by the suspension ofpreconceptions and judgments.How Does This Body Want toMove?In 2016, I initiated the projectHow Does This Body Want to Move?--a multimodal performance andresearch initiative that served as areflection on Elaine's legacy andinfluence on me. This intensive projectentailed a year of performances,master classes, and public conver-sations relating to Elaine's oeuvre,which culminated in the performanceof Elaine in the air and me, a programof works choreographed by myself,Patti Bradshaw, Marion Ramírez, andNoemí Segarra, presented at the 92ndStreet Y in NYC. While conductingmovement research for this project,I discovered that the act of dancingbrought Elaine vividly back to lifein my consciousness. As I danced inrehearsals and performances, shevisited in flashes and fragments,seeding new awareness of herinfluence on my choreography andteaching over the decades. I offerselect fragments here as a means ofrepresenting the way her memoryreverberates in my dancing. Thefollowing two sections containconcepts, reflections, quotes, andmemories culled from movementresearch, conversations with peers,and notes I took while studying withElaine and working on How Does ThisBody Want to Move?In Elaine's Words: Notes fromKinetic Awareness Journals1978-1983Start as tiny as possible: discoverthe subtlety of your body.Center is the place where the bodyreturns when you are not doinganything.There is no place in this work forcriticism.Understand your own body--learnyour problem areas, what's strong,what needs help--and confrontAunt Matilda [the negative voicesfrom the past].The body is an electrical field; energybubbles inside.

When exploringa body part or way of moving, sheencouraged us to move as if we hadnever moved that part of the bodybefore. As we explored our individ-ual experiences, we reinforced eachother's practices, will, and creativitythrough our own example. PattiBradshaw remembers: We became somuch our own movers that we wouldjoke that she had ruined us to be ableto dance with anyone else. One dayyou found out that you knew how todance in your own way, and you hadthe skills to develop in whatever wayyou liked.Marion Ramírez, who studiedwith Elaine from 2003 to 2010, remem-bers that Elaine taught us that wewere experts of our own bodies.This aspect of the teachings was pro-foundly significant to me given myprior training in classical Europeandance, and it was especially importantin my decolonization quest as aPuerto Rican woman.Elaine's generosity and care forher students knew no bounds. Shesupported my artistic developmentwell beyond my participation inher classes and performances. Forinstance, while I was her student, sheonce lent me her loft studio for anearly self-produced concert of work.Over subsequent years, she attendedmany of my concerts, includingseveral in the South Bronx, an areathat most Manhattan folks refused totravel to in order to see work. I havemany memories of her at the end ofeach show, limping down the aisle,beaming a smile, and carrying flowers,like a fairy godmother imparting herblessing. I always wondered how shegot there.Elaine's approach to time wasradical. Marion recalls that in herclasses, there was no need to getanywhere or achieve anything, norto fulfill any expectations. Workingslowly for extended periods of time,you become aware of the flexiblenature of time. Moving in infiniteslowness was the key to tuning into the subtlest details, taking you toa place where, as Patti recalls, youstart to identify one muscle fiber, onecell moving, at a time.Many of the concepts and prac-tices Elaine taught remained beyondmy reach while I worked with her.Nonetheless, Kinetic Awarenesspractices became foundational tomy artistic evolution. From 2005 to2015, I engaged in a multisite projectcalled the Branch Dance series, whichwas informed by intensive trainingin slow effortless movement and byperforming in Elaine's seminal worksin projected environments. ModalPractice, the creative methodology Ihave developed since 1985, engages adance of the energetic body conjuredthrough various principles aroundlistening to the body that I trace backto Elaine, such as moving slowly;letting the body stretch itself; scan-ning through the body; and aligningbreath, sound, and movement.Helping people feel good madeElaine feel good. She wanted to seeus find freedom in our bodies, seehealthy bodies become healthier,see twisted toes find length. Elainewanted to see people moving out ofpain and into pleasure.In GratitudeElaine Summers was a pioneeringartist who had a profound impacton the contemporary dance worldand on thinking about the capacitiesof the human body in motion. As Iremember her here, I pay tribute toher legacy, and I express gratitudewith the hope that this brings greaterawareness to her life and work.uNOTES1CETA refers to the ComprehensiveEmployment and Training Act, whichwas a government program modeled onRoosevelt's Works Progress Administra-tion. In New York City, federal monies toemploy artists were funneled throughdifferent organizations. I was hired bythe Cultural Council Foundation forthree years with an annual salary of$10,000. The job requirements changedover that time. The first year, my 35-hourwork week consisted of 7 hours of com-munity service, and the rest of the timewas designated for work on my choreog-raphy. By the final year, the communityservice requirement had increased toabout 21 hours per week. CETA was likea fellowship, providing a wonderful basisof support for a budding artist.Why is CI important for queer activism? What canqueerness contribute to CI practice?CI practice and queer practices can be seen as alliesthat support each other, but this alliance can't exist withoutmutual disruption. For us, the term queer points to anykind of non-heteronormative and anti-patriarchal behavior,feeling, or sensation. Regarding CI, queerness expressesa sensation or feeling of discomfort and the ability to seepatriarchal heteronormativity functioning in CI spaces.One may ask: Since when is CI about sexuality? Wepose a need for sexual positivity as one of the possiblequeer approaches and as a critique of the disregard offeelings and the negation of sexual sensations within CI.If mainstream CI spaces are being set as pure spaceswithout reference to sexuality, they are, in fact, sex-negative,causing taboos and abuse. We need an understanding ofsexual expression as something that is somatically basicand inalienable, happening everywhere all the time, whichcannot be confined. This means changing our understandingof sexuality altogether. (A deeper conceptual research onthis change of perspective about sexuality is not the aimof this article, but it's needed.)In queer activism, we are very well trained in discursivepractices, like creating concepts and discussing them as agroup to build a set of values and acceptable and unaccep-table practices. We believe our training in discourse couldbe valuable for CI practice, bringing awareness to the socialand political challenges it faces, and also extending concep-tual background for the bodily practice in CI. Conversely,we believe the somatic perspective is underdevelopedamong the queer movement and a queer approach tothe body can advance within a CI framework.QCI 2018: program, aims, what we did, disruptions,remaining questionsIn spring 2018, 25-35 people, mostly dancers, met inHamburg at two successive events: a symposium and adance festival called Queer Contact Improvisation. Thesymposium was designed for experienced contacterswith an aim of artistic research and sharing what queerCI might be and how the dance festival that followedmight be facilitated differently than mainstream ones.The festival itself was conceived as a joyful dance gatheringopen to inexperienced participants. The workshopsduring the symposium and the festival had relevant andstimulating themes, such as Filling the Gap; CI as a Toolto Explore Non-monogamous Dynamics; Closeness andDistance during Physical Contact; Sensual Objectification;Feminist, Safer Space! What's That About? WeavingDominance and Commitment; Dance with Courage;Politics of Mutuality; Beyond Consent; Different Qualitiesof Touch; and Queering Gaze and Space.Two sensations dominate our general impression ofthese events: vital energy and aliveness (as expected fromdance practice and embodied sharing) and the effort ofexpressing and experiencing disagreement. In hindsight,those disruptions appear to have constituted the queernessof the gathering. Examples of deliberate disruptionswere disagreeing to being part of and possibly objectifiedthrough the research; demanding a deep familiarity withand commitment to feminist theory and activism fromall participants; limiting the expectation of inclusivitythrough the facilitation of activities that excluded cismen; acknowledging the need not to be sociable and niceall the time; going topless as a somatic reaction to the heatof the sun despite the possible sexualised interpretation ofthis gesture; artistic intervention of the nipple police,covering all visible nipples with tape; direct critique ofthe suggested working formats; and choosing what notto listen to. The unintentional disruptions includedexpressing one's own vulnerability and traumas in ahighly empathetic community, and directly expressingone's own unconscious propensities, such as reluctancein the choice of a partner for an exercise. Other disrup-tions were experienced as self-confrontations: choosingwhich problematic issues to address publicly and which todeal with privately (the question of responsibility for theemotional labor), confronting one's shame around being aprivileged cis man, or realizing oneself not to be as lovingand inclusive as one had believed oneself to be.One participant wrote: In the last jam, I was dancing,laughing, and crying at the same time. I didn't knowwhy, what happened. What was the joy of our meeting?When we read participants' words from the last sharingwe realized that great joy was mainly described as aprivate, bodily sensation: being empowered, comforted,or grounded; taking up space. The joyful interpersonalrelations were described as coming together, integration,seeing the vulnerability of others, and showing yourself.These experiences were often directly followed by questionsabout one's place in the group--about inevitable self-respon-sibility and limits of intersubjective communication. Thisdistanced togetherness seems to be remarkable incomparison to the vague us that is often heard inclosing circles of mainstream festivals.The difficulty of balancing consensus and disagreementwas one of the biggest surprises during the symposium,leading to the question of whether the queer movementis intrinsically inclusive or not.Queer CI space: unfolding core values of CIWhen creating a queer CI event, we face the questionof whether this is a CI space for queers or a queer perspec-tive on CI. The second option is more interesting to us,yet we think the first one must be encouraged to get intothe second one. In a dance space ruled by patriarchalheteronormative norms, the interactions that can happenare limited by its implicit rules, which dominate the space.A queer perspective on CI is about freeing the space fromthis kind of maybe unconscious, or at least unsaid, implicitor inexplicit control. Although at the moment we are notable to say exactly what the core of our queer dancing is,it nonetheless seems to have a magnetic effect that bringstogether practitioners from very different communitiesand from outside the community of queer activists.From a political perspective, there's a common core ofqueer values and CI values: horizontality, equality, breakingthe patterns, building up a different kind of interpersonalspace, proactivity, and so on. At the same time, CI seemsto be a mirror of society and may unintentionally andsubconsciously reproduce inequality, anachronistic patterns,and social conventions through bodily interactions. Inthis sense, an alliance of CI and queer approaches maystrengthen their shared core.For now, we understand that the queer approach to CIimplies balance between bodily experience and discourse.To be queer is one of the possible ways to feel and to say Iam different. This statement is the beginning of a discourseon otherness that is rooted in the experience of one'sown gendered body and bodily desire. This discourse isgrounded in the habit of naming the smallest privatesensations that may feel irrelevant but which add up toone's bodily sense of existence and underlie subjectiveidentity and orientation. A queer perspective makes thisexplicit and necessary in order to gain social visibilityand legitimacy. When CI is practiced in a cis-heterosexualenvironment, those kinds of sensations are easily skippedbecause the heteropatriarchal norm tends to try to makeitself invisible. Subtle sexual expressions and sensationslike I feel you inside me already when I step in yourperi-personal space might not be well received in a hetero-normative practice of CI. In contrast, I feel your floorthrough our common bodily structure is a more neutralway of describing an intimate encounter, washed of anykind of voluptuous sensations or feelings and thus acceptable.Making present what is cataloged as intimate orprivate, against the flow, or conflictive in the CIdance space can contribute to making visible the cis-heteropatriarchal norm. Clearly, practice is the sourceof knowledge. This process of queering CI is in its earlystages and needs practice to unfold its insights and dis-course, advancing from queerness as identity politics toqueerness as a quality of somatic interaction.Knowledge: the language of fleshIn the 20th century, somatic practices were system-atized within a rational framework as body knowledge.Those who systematized them--largely under the influ-ence of Buddhism and New Age thinking--were gatheringknowledge from other parts of the globe because theywere questioning Western cultural standards of knowl-edge and finding them inadequate for describing somaticexperience. There is also the discussion around exoticismand whether somatics contains a certain amount ofwhitened orientalism and cultural appropriation.In any case, CI adds an artistic and a horizontalcommunicational approach to somatics, which can be ofhigh interest for queer, feminist, anti-racist, anti-ableist,animalist, and other political movements. Post-humanistpolitical movements, somatics being part of them, canhelp shape a whole new approach to human life and ourfuture development on planet Earth.All of these means are looking for a balance betweenfeeling free to be empathetic and feeling free to expressdisagreement and, by doing so, are widening the possibleinteractions in dance and queer spaces. This could lead topeaceful experiences of conflict and diverse and playfulexperiences of consensus. Political queer activism and CIConsent: developing a queer political perspective onCI from a critique of consentOne of the failed assumptions about these QCI eventswas that sexually intense dances would take place. Wewonder if this absence of sexual intensity could be relatedto the heightened awareness that queer activists haveabout the practice of consent.Of course, a queer space is not freed of the possibilityof sexual assault, but generally our understanding of con-sent comes from the idea of how it developed for straightspaces. A queer and somatic critique of consent couldchange how we approach consent when we are not in aheteronormative situation. The heteronormative idea ofconsent comes from a backdrop of unequal power rela-tions and verbally based frameworks. In CI, there is thepossibility of preverbal consensus beyond words.There are inherent problems with an embodied (non-verbal) perspective of consent: what is it to believe thatyou are empathizing with another person versus actuallyempathizing with the other person? When approachingconsent, there's always some insecurity that threatens thesafe space as a whole. However, what we know within thepolitical queer movement is that at some point we haveto trust in order to be able to escape from this circularity,to be able to let go of that feeling of generalized suspicionthat abuse could happen--that I cannot know another'sfeelings about my touch. Releasing from that feeling ofsuspicion implies a commitment to the responsibility ofthinking, speaking, dancing, and practicing how to buildtrust by disassembling relationships of domination andsubmission between the participants. We think buildingtrust is something very, very queer. From a queer contactimprovisation perspective, this is an ambition the wholeCI community should pursue and practice.Preliminary suggestions for facilitation of queerCI eventsWhat have we learned from QCI 2018 that we can takeforward into the facilitation of future queer dance events?1. 2. 3. 4. Be open for the unexpected. Expect disagreement.The outcome of both events turned out to differfrom facilitators' plans. During the symposium, weexperienced reluctance toward objectifying researchand toward the effort of consistent documentation.The festival also had disruptive vitality alongsideaffirmation. This shows a need for new formulas ofdance meetings.Create braver spaces, which can be shared by peoplewith different openness to challenges and wherephysical, sensory, and emotional risks can be taken,in addition to safer spaces, free from sexual andsocial abuse or harassment.Independent dance practice, research, facilitation,and healing are different roles, which are difficultto handle simultaneously by one or two persons.Delegate them to a broader team and to the wholecommunity.Use the venue to support your group process.Besides the main place for gathering as acommunity, you may need• places for gathering in subgroups;• a protected place for healing;• a place for being alone;• accessibility for everyone.photo © Wiktor SkrzypczakParticipants of the QCI symposium during the workshopBeyond Consent, with teacher Aramo Olaya; Hamburg,Germany, May 2018.5. Use the work session time according to participants'bodily and mental resources:• start each activity with movement;• balance speaking, moving, and resting time;• don't wait until the evening for preciousimprovisation time; people might be too tired.6. Determine the balance between moving and talkingby the choice of prompts for the activity:• text for discursive exchange and research;• movement or performance for embodiedexchange and research.7. Take your time with big questions; focus onsmall ones.8. 9. Reduce the external input from teachers.Keep the leading question of the meeting specificand sharp. It will get bigger and more complexnevertheless.10. Offer additional introduction, including gender-neutral language and preferred pronouns.11. If you are determined to use specific work formatsor documentation and research methods, inform theparticipants about it beforehand in the descriptionof the event, and be consistent. People are surprisinglythankful for reliable frameworks.12. Have methods workshops. Sometimes how you dothe thing is more important than the thing itself.Develop new, embodied methods.13. Observe when the movement evokes meaningand when the meaning moves. Blend verbal andcorporeal practices. Stay at the edge of implicitand explicit communication. Work out new,performative ways of knowing and relating;write down your method; share it; and test it.",
