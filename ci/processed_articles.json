It's as if the pressure of holding thesedynamic experiences, flattened together between two covers,standing side by side on a shelf, has finally reached its limit, acritical mass that must explode, transform into another medium,another state.I follow the fountain of pages, CQ 's ultimately untrackable holographicdissemination of embodied dance practice and discovery over thelast 45 years, as the issues unbind and spread out. The aeration isa relief. The dances hover, shimmer, and shift. Gravity hasn't yettaken hold of the bits and brought them back down to earth. Maybeit never will. Maybe new forces are at work here, conditions thatdon't yet have names but do have influence. Maybe our next danceforms, creations, revelations, practices, collaborations, improvisations,breathe a different kind of air, travel best through materials and mediawe haven't yet considered, invented, discovered, or recognized.What you hold in your hands is CQ 's last print periodical publication.Hold it tight. Hold it loose. Savor it. Celebrate its unique 45-year run,in which you have actually played a significant part. Now set it downgently--or enjoy a good hard dash of it to the ground, or just let itfall from your hands and watch gravity take it down. And then comewith us as we shift our editorial weight to CQ Unbound , our year-roundonline publication, and to whatever other adventures come next.In this moment I can feel the familiar thrill of making somethingunfamiliar, the awkwardness and fear and promise of uncertainty,the suspension of belief that allows a new thing to arise, to berecognized and welcomed. We're walking the improvisational talkas we enter this new unknown.I stand in awe of this change. I shift my weight from leg to leg,from land (print) to air (online), not yet certain of the forms thatwill arise to communicate the dancing, thinking, feeling, movementdiscovery, and experiences we will have next.My collaboration with the incomparable brilliance and particularityof Contact Quarterly/Contact Editions codirector and coeditor LisaNelson has been central to CQ over these decades. Together, wehave made manifest the very specific and circumstantial collectionof voices, images, designs, layouts, and formats necessary for CQand Contact Editions. The perpetual friction of our differences hascontinued to irritate, stimulate, and illuminate the passion we havefor encouraging and documenting the articulation of the mysteriesof the moving body. It is one of my life's most unpredictable, precious,challenging, beloved, and valued collaborations.photo by Nancy Stark SmithImprovising at the CQ office, April 2015.And then there's the essential, largely invisible team of brilliantand committed editors and designers that have made the last 20+years of issues possible. Working side by side with me every stepof the way, the designers (Lila Hurwitz, Patrick O'Rourke, and JillApolinario), associate editors (Mary Ramsay, Melinda Buckwalter,Nyx Zierhut, Aretha Aoki, Lailye Weidman, and Meredith Bove), andhardworking CI Newsletter coeditors (Cheryl Pallant, Pen Dale,Sue Lauther, Sara Zolbrod, Neige Christiansen, Dey Summer, andColleen Bartley) have bridged connections between CQ and newgenerations and communities of artists, proofread every commaon the final pages, voiced opinions about page and cover designs,and initiated and followed up on communication with authors. Forpitifully low wages, their commitment and vision have contributedmore to CQ 's legacy than could ever be measured.Right now, I'm picturing the bouquet of issues--with a strongintention of sharing the innovation and inspiration that broughtthem together--unbinding as it flies and, after a long luxurioussuspension, falling in a myriad of delightful ways into your manyunsuspecting hands.With love and profound thanks for your sustained trust andcreative engagement with CQ now, in years past, and in theunknowable and thus infinitely possible future, where ourdancing bodies and minds will continue to meet.Nancy Stark SmithP.S. Part 2 of Throwing the Bouquet (and the original impetusfor that title)--a passing of the Contact Improvisation archivalbaton--will jump the frame of this Note, crossing the bridge toCQ 's online home, CQ Unbound . Read more on our website:Moving Ideas--Physical and Virtual Spaces:CQ & Me & CQ and...I first heard about CQ from Leah Stein in 1994, as anundergraduate student at Swarthmore College [in Swarth-more, PA] when she encouraged us to submit our writingsabout our experiences with CI. It felt exciting to me thata publication would want to hear from college students.I didn't submit in the end, but it was my first exposureto the journal, and I thoroughly enjoyed the articles andespecially the ads and that it was artist led. I noticed theContacts listings in the back of people to reach out towhen traveling, which I did at times.My second significant experience with CQ was in2005, when CQ coeditor Melinda Buckwalter invitedme to write about my project Artifacts of the Ephemeral,which was a residency and installation that took place atChisenhale Dance Space in London, England. The finalarticle, A Moving Installation, appeared in the Place2 issue,CQ Vol. 32.1, Winter/Spring 2007. I was flattered that theeditors wanted to hear about my small project when therewere other, more established artists, and I was also (andstill am) blown away by the attention that the editorialteam gave me in the process of articulating my ideas, theirdesire to understand my practice, and the commitment tohave the writing reflect that, to include details of the feltsense even down to the title.My relationship with CQ changed dramatically whenNancy Stark Smith asked me to be guest coeditor with herof the CQ CI Newsletter in 2012. Our first Skype call wasover six hours long, going over the ins and outs of makingonline and print versions, including photo captions andcredits. We haven't stopped coediting the Newsletter since,and it has developed over the past seven years of our worktogether. The articles have grown in their scope and length.We've improved systems that enable us to edit live onlineand to work remotely. I've had the pleasure to work withVideo still of Colleen Bartley in Walk on Blue, filmed by Richard Bleasdalein 2000 and used as part of Bartley's Meditations on Vulnerability, 2018.the writing from more than 200 authors from about 30countries about their CI practice.It has been a labor of love and a pleasure to workwith dancers and teachers from all over the world who areenthusiastic about CI. I have received an education aboutpublishing, translating, and ways of working with peopleto craft their language (in English) to describe and sharetheir dance practice.I'd like to bookend this story by mentioning my latestperformance at Chisenhale Dance Space in November2018, Meditations on Vulnerability. It is directly related toCQ. I say this because Chisenhale is an artist-led projectthat is about the same age as CQ. It's the place that hasbeen a home to my eclectic practice and has a kinshipwith CI; after Dartington College, Chisenhale is the placein the UK where CI was practiced most abundantly in itsearly years and it supported New Dance and had its ownpublication. It also relates to the approach I take as aneditor, which is directly related to my creative practiceand my experience of living in the world with a humanbody, its form, and its vulnerabilities. Both are artist-ledprojects and both have been a home base for me becauseof a common ethos of curiosity. As an editor, the authorstake the lead and my role is to listen and reflect back andhelp them articulate their ideas in their own unique way.What First Rule of CI?There have been several articles about Contact Improvisa-tion in recent CQs with prominent references to the FirstRule of Contact Improvisation,* most recently How theFirst Rule Brought #MeToo to Contact Improvisation byMichele Beaulieux, CQ Vol. 44.1, Winter/Spring 2019, aswell as Martin Keogh's mention of it in previous CQ articlesand now his book, Dancing Deeper Still. In each case, I havewanted to pipe up to either edit these mentions or footnotethem with my own opinion, but I resisted, as it felt like aninappropriate use of my editorial power with CQ. It isonly now that I have finally taken the time and page spaceto respond. [N.S.S.]*From Richard Kim's blog post: Rules: It's called the FirstRule of CI, or the Only Rule, or...maybe the FundamentalPrinciple. Its shorthand version is 'take care of yourself,' butI've heard it expressed as, 'Above all else, you are responsiblefor yourself.'In my experience as a member of the first grouppracticing Contact Improvisation with Steve Paxton in1972, the original training for Contact and the foundationfor the early years of its development encouraged both anawareness of our own limits and (mostly physical) safety,and, an awareness of those around us. This emphasis onawareness and safety for all continues to be at the founda-tion of my own practice and teaching of CI. The idea oftaking care of yourself--in other words, of dancing withawareness so as to work within your limits (howeverdrawing by Neca Zarvosyou perceive them)--was never a call to be only, or evenprimarily, concerned with one's own safety and well-being.We were always looking out for each other.It seems that perhaps the telephone game phenom-enon is at work here. Apparently some people who heardthe initial suggestion in early CI classes to take care ofyourself and those around you (through the use of periph-eral vision, etc.) were so happy to be given permission toprioritize taking care of themselves that the second half ofthat suggestion/principle withered on the vine. Eventually,it seems, the suggestion was further reduced to take careof yourself first (and foremost) and achieved First Rule ofCI status. Ouch! This hurts me every time I hear it.I wonder when this term first rule emerged. Itcertainly was not there in the first years of CI. Therewere no explicit rules as far as I remember--only anatmosphere and practice of encouraging mutual safety,support, and discovery. (And the suggestion to put onefoot back when catching a hurtling body so you couldspiral on the way down and not just be knocked over.)When I recently brought up this first rule phenome-non with first generation CI dancer Nita Little, she wasstunned and said she had never heard the term before.So I think it's fair to say that this construction is a morerecent invention. It was not there from the beginning,as is regularly implied in exchanges on social media andin writing that I've seen. Exactly when it began, I don'tknow. Although it seems pervasive now among many CIpractitioners and communities, I think it might be usefulfor CI researchers, teachers, and practitioners to knowthat it was not part of the foundation of the work.The phenomenon of this kind of reduction ofvalues, intentions, and suggestions into inaccurate andall-too-solid dogmas and rules is a compelling, albeitdisconcerting, study.I am grateful to feel the current questioning anddiscussion concerning this important but apparentlymisunderstood, misnamed, and misused principle: whichwas, and is, for me always about taking care to dance insuch a way as to not injure yourself or others.I set out to construct a timeline of my involvement withcontact improvisation and Contact Quarterly and was,needless to say, extremely grateful to own an almostcomplete set of back issues--because at my advanced age,I discover that though I can recall places and dates, I amlosing my memory for names. Herewith, what I was ableto pull together:1975: A fledgling dance critic for the Canadian Broadcast-ing Corporation, I'm invited to show up at the VancouverOpera Association for what turns out to be Steve Paxtonand Nancy Stark Smith's first performance of ContactImprovisation in Vancouver, BC. This encounter utterlyupends my sense of what dance might be.1977: I enroll in workshops at Vancouver's Western Front,where I study CI with members of ReUnion (Steve, Nancy,Nita Little, and Curt Siddall), and Mangrove (Curt, ByronBrown, John LeFan, and James Tyler). My first effort atwriting about Contact, broadcast on the CBC in June, istranscribed and reprinted in an early issue of the ContactNewsletter. Later, I travel to Berkeley for the July Projectin the Moving Arts, an intensive involvement with Curt,James, Terry Sendgraff, and Ruth Zaporah.1979: Having moved back to New York and taken a jobrunning the American Dance Guild, I use my vacation toreturn to Vancouver for Current Exchange, a gathering ofexperienced contactors led by Steve and including a veryyoung Stephen Petronio. He heads for New York and a jobas the first male in the Trisha Brown Dance Company.The idea emerges to make improvisation the focus ofthe Guild's next annual meeting...1980...to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in June,with Steve as the keynote speaker; Anna Halprin as theguest of honor; and practically every contact dancer onthe continent involved in a teaching capacity. We call itDance as Art Sport, after a remark by Simone Forti.1982: In a CI class in Manhattan, I tumble off Petronio'sback and bruise my coccyx, convincing myself that it'stime to let this practice go. But by then I've been draftedonto the board of Contact Collaborations, Inc.; I find,tucked in with the back issues, copies of minutes ofboard meetings and a draft book proposal for a fieldguide to contact improvisation, which never material-ized; Cynthia Novack's 1990 Sharing the Dance and other,later treatises--and of course, CQ itself--filled this need.)Novack died in 1996. As I page through my hugecollection of back issues, I become aware of how many ofour colleagues are gone, including James Tyler, my collegeclassmate; dancer and teacher Nancy Topf; choreographerTrisha Brown; and countless dancers and writers whowrote to and in CQ. I was rarely one of those writers, asmy economic situation made it necessary to be paid formy work.From its photocopied beginnings, the magazine grewthicker, fancier, less frequent, but has always been full ofinvaluable material from across the world. Now, in 2019,we bid farewell to this print edition of CQ, as we have toso many other publications. Though I love paging throughold paper copies, digital materials are much more easilysearchable and more widely, quickly, and inexpensivelydistributed. CQ is dead; long live CQ--and the generationsof thinkers, doers, and writers who've contributed to thisunique chronicle.With thanks to Nancy, Lisa Nelson, Steve, and all the restof the crew,In celebration of the digital adventure--CQ becomesaccessible? It is really a new adventure to try and promoteCQ to new readers.Touchdown Dance (TD), a unique company foundedin 1986 at Dartington College in Devon, UK, by Steve Paxtonand Anne Kilcoyne, grew from an idea of Steve's to bringtogether visually impaired and sighted people in theContact Improvisation (CI) experience. It appeared that atouch-based movement method would be of use to touch-based navigators in the world, and an accessible means tobring diverse bodies together. Something extraordinary isseeded by the very idea of CI, and new movement evolves,shapes itself into form spontaneously--like a choreographyof presence, of pause in motion. TD grew into a ground-breaking experience that people travel far and wide to do.Steve and Anne's article on TD [Common Sense]was one of a wave of initiatives that were written about forthe first time in a substantial way in CQ in your Dancingwith Different Populations issue in 1992 [CQ Vol. 17.1].The world of somatic practices, improvised scores, andCI-based methods have been the foundation to Touchdown'sperformances since 1992. Currently, Touchdown Dancehas three visually impaired and two sighted dancersmaking work, dancing CI, and improvising whilst teach-ing around the UK and internationally. We created aneducation pack in which the CI methods and legacy ofSteve and Anne are relayed in word and image to informcommunity and education settings in which we work.We are avid readers and supporters of CQ--and feelrelieved, as it goes digital, that it will be more accessibleto screen reader software and saving trees!!Katy Dymoke; Manchester, UKArtistic director, Touchdown Dance (since 1994)Dear CQ,The transference of movement information through theglobal contact improvisation community--an example:We were fortunate to have a copy of Contact Quarterly,Summer/Fall 2000 (Vol. 25.2), passed on from an elderteacher who had two copies--shared with her keenand developing CI dancer friends in Newcastle, a smallContact community three hours north of Sydney.The article Spacewalk--Reflections on Nancy Topf'sSpacewalk Improvisation was read and reflected on. Howtragically this woman died and yet how wonderful thatshe lives on through her work then and now. Excerptswere read to our dance improvisation collective, andthe exercise interpreted and performed. So playful anddynamic. Thanks, Nancy. And thanks Contact Quarterly.Definitely a journal for moving ideas!Even though it is only the paper version of CQ we aresaying goodbye to, it is still a heart-wrenching goodbyeto the physical, holdable, lie-on-your-bedside-table-able,put-in-your-bag-able, loanable, savorable version of themagazine that has given me, for forty-odd years, a greatbeing to belong to, whose wise, laughing, listening, andloving arms reach around the globe.Even though the online version thrives, lives on,goes out even farther and wider than the beloved paperone, I feel a loss, and a need to express my gratitude forall the years and all the labor that went into making it,sacrificing personal creative time for the benefit of thecollective.Nancy and Lisa, Melinda and all the fabulousassistant and guest editors, designers, and staff over theyears, you have been for me the roots of a magnificent tree,nourishing all of us who wanted to exchange our stories,news, and ideas, add our leaf, our flower, our pine coneloaded with winged seeds, in hopes that the winds mightcarry our feelings far. You gave us access to those winds,lifting us all into the sky on such far-reaching branches,giving all that such great beings give: inspiration, nourish-ment, shelter in the storm, and the very air we breathe. Iam a leaf on that tree, and there is not even a way for meto imagine my life without you.At the Somatics Festival 2019 in Northampton, MA, inSeptember--celebrating the work of Janet Adler, BonnieBainbridge Cohen, Nancy Stark Smith, and the 45-yearHeritage of Contact Quarterly--I sat on a panel titledArchiving the Experience of the Body in Motion withseveral distinguished archive curators.As editor of Currents Journal of the Body-MindCentering Association and Lost & Found: The CUNYPoetics Document Initiative, I felt ready to speak tobeing immersed in people's archives--my grandmother'sbuttons, my father's papers, and, later, the NYC municipalarchives in search of archaeological sites. But it wasn'tuntil I studied Body-Mind Centering that I was able toaccount for my own body and dig back to my earliesttraining, the Rhythms Fundamentals (of Ruth Doing)--a vital, but rare artifact of the American PhysicalCulture Movement.During the panel's closing, Nancy Stark Smithasked how to create an archive that was active, how totranslate experience into language and then open it backinto experience. I get it--the dancer's archive interlopeswith the reader/mover by matter of both light (film) andlanguage (scores, writings, techniques), but dance iscommunal; therefore, even the soloist is derivative from aprevious form or technique. Example: I am currently cata-loguing Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's papers (1970-present)bound for their archival home. But does the founder's workstand alone? At this panel, Cohen said, This work wascreated in community. She wonders how to house a50-year dialogue that evolved Body-Mind Centering?Librarians and academics must take into account thenature of the bodies of the archive. It becomes a place thatstrikes us in situ and in choir. The archive is an emotionaland tactile experience not unlike the contact improvisa-tion-feeling of profundity of weight, matter, and current(flow). As Nancy put it, the translation of the languageback into experience, and, in Bonnie's words, the work...in community. I call it summoning the interface.Shall we enter the bodies of the archive from theperspective of the mover as well as the language of themovement? Finally, there ought to be a way to fashion amover's papers with enough interface as to allow forour touch.Kate Tarlow Morgan, MA, RSME;Marlboro, VermontI'm mourning the last of CQ's classy print periodicals.Congratulations and best wishes for CQ Unbound (greatname!). With gratitude and love,Aileen Crow was a beloved teacher and prolific somaticresearcher who combined her study and practice of manytechniques and philosophies of movement, creativity, andhealing to transform the lives of her students, colleagues,and anyone who came in contact with her and her work.A Laban Movement Analyst, teacher of the AlexanderTechnique since 1969, and practitioner of Neuro-Linguis-tic Programming, Aileen brought together AuthenticMovement, Mindell's Dreambody Process Work, and amultitude of other bodywork, therapeutic, movement,and creative disciplines to guide people into movement,creativity, and wellness.Her clear writings, playful character drawings,and illuminating insights contributed lucid, embodiedresearch to Contact Quarterly.Paula Sager, cofounding editor of A Moving Journal,writes, Aileen had an eye for rogue movement patterns--the odder the better--and an ear for the unspoken word,the invisible sound. She had a nose for the best of eachmodality she mastered and an unparallel appetite forunfolding process. She was a big-hearted, rebel-mindedcontributing editor for A Moving Journal, engaging con-tinuous, dynamic research and dialogue in the field ofAuthentic Movement.Aileen lived in New City, NY, and was 93 whenshe passed away on April 13, 2019. In additionto CQ's back issues (searchable on our website),Aileen's writings Janis Claxton--an Australian dancer based in Bristol,UK, and then Edinburgh, Scotland--began her artisticand teaching practice with the health and wellness of thebody. Her work shows how art is health and health is artand that art should be enlivening, nourishing, and healing.Her key ideas about relating in contact improvisation wereanchored in a keen sense of somatic health, informed byher deep understanding of the Erick Hawkins work.In leading contact improvisation workshops suchas Dancing in and out of Contact and Returning Hometo the Body, Janis emphasized self-sensing, internalphysics in relation to environment, and detailed alignmentto facilitate students' precise, expressive, and highlytuned dancing. She was highly perceptive and insightfulwith regard to stuck points in one's dancing. Whileworkshopping a skill having to do with partnering, shewould often stop and take us to the floor or to the wallto investigate our own patterning. Working on patternsto release and align the body led to openings and under-standings in the physical, emotional, and mindful aspectsof dancing--often leading to a deeper sense of creativityand self knowledge. Janis was a powerful teacher whocould quickly bring students to their inner truths andto the heart of the matter.Erick Hawkins was a profound inspiration for Janis,and she credits him with the initiation of somatic investiga-tion in the field of modern dance. Janis herself was a tirelessadvocate for healthy dance practice, somatic intelligence,and women in dance. She was strongly critical of thetrends toward extreme bodies in performance. In ourlast conversation, she was enthusiastically checking myfeminist outlook, sharpening my critical thinking, andsharing her amazing energy and insight! I am so gratefulfor her work, artistry, making, and teaching.Tamara Ashley, UKRobin MacRostieApril 16, 1945-September 29, 2019An active and beloved member of the Western Massachusettsarts community, Robin MacRostie brought her creativespirit and passion for dance to everything she did.

Thank youfor your support, your leadership, and your commitment tomaking connections. With love.NoiseI've been thinking about the idea of ambiguity. SometimesI call it abstraction. Sometimes it is the unknown, orobscurity. I would like to start with the idea that thingsaround us are mostly ambiguous. What we see and under-stand clearly--articulated ideas, clear shapes of furniture,harmonized objects, sharp edges of architecture, and soon--are more or less rare. Of course, we constantly striveto seek out harmony, connection, order, agreement, clarity,shape, and the tangible...at least, I find myself seekingsome type of definition for things and ideas.We are social beings, living in society with others. Theseharmonized objects and ideas are also how we communi-cate with each other. Language, for example, as a symbolicmethod of communication, is a product of that bent towardharmony and connection. A traffic light is created for allthe cars to be regulated and in order on the streets.Still, I am fascinated with non-harmonized, abstracted,noise-like things. Things that exist around those harmo-nies, things that are usually dismissed, things that arealways taken for granted, things that are situated innegative space, things that are mundane or even invisible.When sidony o'neal--one of the dancers in Direct Path toDetour (whose individual interdisciplinary practice spansexperimental sound, sculpture, drawing, performance,and writing)--and I worked on a short improvisationalperformance together a few years back, I shared MichelSerres's text on noise.2 I still remember sidony's response,which was to point out the importance of imbalance anddiscord as reminders of every noise that we are not able tohear or that we've been hearing too much of.I do admit that I usually get satisfaction from harmonizedthings. They give me a sense of understanding, of provingthat I communicated clearly, of security...but if I give moreattention to the noises (some people might call them whitenoise), those harmonized things can acquire a renewedmeaning.As I am writing this, I realize how Buddhist this approachcould seem. Maybe I am a Buddhist. Maybe I am beingJapanese. Maybe I am just being Taka. Whatever.Even in this technology/Internet-centric society, whereI am used to easy access to seeing and understanding,I can't look up noises or abstracted ideas online. I like itthat way. Once a noise is defined, it loses its core quality.Noise needs to be perceived with awareness and a willing-ness to surrender. Noise can be interpreted only with time,because noise transforms and changes moment to moment.Noise is something to experience, not to understandintellectually.Harmony and agreement are rare, but also inevitable. Inthis current society, we live with harmony, agreement, andmeaning as much as with chaos and noise. In observingnoise, I want to be open to the effects that harmony andmeaning have on us.Continually being thrown off balance is another thing;if a state of complete balance is harmony, then I seek tokeep this harmony constantly dissipating only so thatit can be harmonized or balanced again. Maybe we candeliberately access harmony for a moment but bypassit toward something else? So that we never dwell inharmony or meaning?I am making a correlation between the concept of noiseand abstraction. In the midst of making Direct Path toDetour, I started to lose the distinction between those twoconcepts. Maybe as I move forward with my practice, I'llrealize the distinction or confuse myself more and more.Either way, this project has been driving me forward.ObservationI believe that art--both ephemeral/experiential formslike live performance and object/image-based work thatviewers can contemplate at their own pace--has a powerto engage with meanings and ideas. I am thinking beyondthe argument about art as mere self-expression or acciden-tal self-expression--that engagement with meaningscan happen in various forms, such as creating, exposing/revealing, defying, denying, investigating, observing,criticizing, and playing with.As a maker, I enjoy using my artistic practice to observean idea or a concept that I'm curious about. Maybe I findmeanings from the act of observing. Curiosity drives mypractice; I observe how I, as a performer, feel/think/do inrelationship to the task that I give myself in front of theviewers (observers).I find that I often resonate with liberal and progressivethinking in contemporary American society. As I learnmore and more, I realize that I am a pure product of capital-ism and neoliberalism. Maybe that has something to dowith the fact that I grew up in Japanese society, which hasbeen ideologically driven by capitalistic ideals, especiallysince World War II. I get fulfillment out of working hard,challenging myself, and accomplishing the goals that I setfor myself. In addition to this social factor, my parents areextremely driven people, continuously encouraging meand my siblings to act on things rather than to wait forsomething to come about. Of course, as an artist, I don'tmake a lot of money (which defies that capitalistic ideal),but I notice that I find pleasure in productivity and instriving for something bigger than myself or beyond whereI am at the moment. It seems that an investment in thepractice of observing resists these neoliberal habits thathave been ingrained in me.In 2004, I studied with theatre artist Mary Overlie,who, through the teaching of her Viewpoints method,states that she values being an observer/participantas opposed to a creator/originator when she makeswork or performs. It took me a while to understand whatthat means to me. When I started making my own workin 2009, I began to appreciate that way of thinking andaspired to embody that concept.From 2010 to 2014, I had an opportunity to learn intimatelyabout the late Japanese nature photographer-essayistMichio Hoshino. With an invitation from director LeonIngulsrud (from SITI company), I was lucky enough toresearch and play the role of Michio in PerseveranceTheatre Company's original production of The Blue Bearin Juneau, Alaska. One token of his candid yet profoundlifelong contemplation is the idea that humans are just amere part of nature, which criticizes the assumed divisionbetween nature and civilization. His philosophy alsospeaks to the cycle of lives--paraphrasing from the scriptof the play if I may--from plankton to herrings, herringsto whales, whales to fishes, fishes to bears, bears to trees,then trees to plankton. Circle of life. And he states thatwe, as humans, are part of this circle. His ideas comefrom his experience of spending much time in nature--observing living things with great patience, tenacity,curiosity, and obsession.I believe that Mary Overlie and Michio Hoshino have hada big influence on my way of observing.What this observing does for me, especially when doneduring live performance, is to put a gentle brake on mycoiled-up, goal-oriented modus operandi. In this technol-ogy/Internet-centric society, I find myself bored right awaywhen I don't have access to understanding at my fingertips,in a second. But this quality of observing requires perceiv-ing at a slower speed, allowing me to be with the present(what I feel physically, what I think at that moment, whatI see) rather than being preoccupied with the future(reaching toward where I want to go or what I want toaccomplish). I admit that as a choreographer, sometimescreating a product takes priority over an awareness of timeitself, but I get a high from trying not to strive for the veryephemeral minutes or hours of performing. This is alsowhat I feel and value when I view performances.Yes, live performance always involves an audience/viewers.Although I sometimes deliberately face the viewers, impli-cating their gaze in my performative action and invitingthem to be part of the event, I have been learning that thisobservation-oriented performance that I'm interested inhas a tendency to be all about the performers (myself),thus alienating the viewers' experience. So, in thinkingabout viewership as a vital part of this phenomenologicalevent called live performance, I want to put as much consi-deration into how viewers engage as with what's beingpresented. What does this observation in performancedo to the viewers as they go on a ride with the presentedexperience, create meaning and narratives, and invest inwhat they see? What kind of experience shall I invite theviewers to travel through?I don't know the answers to those questions. I probablywon't know the answers for a while, or ever. But thischallenge of holding both my value of observation inperformance and the viewers' experience in parallelfuels me in the making process.Drew Klein, performing arts director at the ContemporaryArts Center in Cincinnati, has spoken about Direct Path toDetour in relationship to the idea of protest. As much as Iappreciate his perspective, I told him that I see the themeof this project to be more in line with resistance.I would like us, the performers, to observe while perform-ing. That is important for me. What if observation can be aform of resistance?The observation of noise. The observation of the non-understandable. Even if it is just pure attempt, is thatcompromise? If we find ourselves, in a society, confrontedwith varying and sometimes contradictory sets of valuesystems, would it be possible to observe that in-between-ness without taking a side, without arriving at harmonyor order? Could we live in the noise? Could we perceiveourselves and others as mere noise for a second, encom-passing a greater whole? Could we be abstract together?At this point, the question becomes, Then what? Whatfollows observation? The dramaturge Lu Yim pointed thisout to me during the production. Again, I don't have theanswer at this moment. Intentionality of observation, orembodiment of the observed/observing states might havesomething to do with it, but I can't articulate that, yet.I stood before the crown of the saint who foundedHungary.

The exhibition was dedicated to the inner experiences of the dancers, invitingthe audience to nap, meditate-while-standing (aka small dance), and every Sunday to practiceContact Improvisation in a studio we had carved out within the walls of the museum. It alsopresented videos of Steve's early pieces from the Judson era, Grand Union performances, andContact Improvisation, as well as installations based on Material for the Spine, a wall of thecomplete back issues of Contact Quarterly, and videos of Steve performing the GoldbergVariations, PA RT, and many other solo and group works.That evening, Jurij Konjar restaged Satisfyin Lover, a piece Steve made in 1968 for 42ordinary people to cross the stage and sit, walk, or stand; and FLAT, a solo from 1964. Jurij alsoimprovised to J.S. Bach's The Goldberg Variations interpreted by Glenn Gould, inspired by a solothat Steve performed from 1986 to 1992.The next day, Steve gave a two-hour talk in Culturgest's grand auditorium at the invitationof Liliana Courtinho (Talks Curator for Culturgest). What follows is excerpted from his talk.Steve Paxton. Well...[bringinghis chair to the edge of the stage, lookingat the audience].So here you are. Against allobstacles, here you are.How did you do it?When I think of an audienceand the man-hours that it takes toprepare to go out and sit in a theatre--all the arrangements that it takes,the scheduling, the calendars, thebaby-sitters, the shopping, theclothes--the clothes alone must takehours and hours.Just give them their weight.I wanted to speak today withyoung dancers, if they came.Just to say, first of all, that theroute to becoming a dancer is a longone. And this is because you have togrow the information: you don't getthe information; what you get is aten-year course, in which you haveto change your body; you have toactually develop, grow, direct yourown growth and be directed by yourteachers into a different body.The reason for this is that thedances we [Western dancers] dancework with projection, or extension,or stretch, or pointing--the extremesof the geometry of the body. I don'tknow why we've done that, exceptthat for a theatre like the one we arein right now--I could make intimategestures here on stage that might notcarry to the top row. Maybe that's thecase, maybe as theatres got bigger,the dance became grander. But, atany rate, it seems we have inventedsomething that no other dance hadever done. It is quite an invention.What does it mean to have aninvention in movement? In humangrowth? In the development of whatwe become? I don't know if I cananswer this question.Each culture invents its art,and we don't know exactly the rulesbehind that. We know what we'vedone. We can see it. We've heardabout it. For instance, the story ofmodern dance coming to counter thepower of ballet. Or so I was told, eventhough I don't think it's really true.I mean modern dance was as muchdependent on ballet as Lisbon isdependent on Ancient Greece: itwas a basis. And yet, with the moderndance came a new idea, the idea thatit didn't have to be a universal dance,that it could be a personal dance.When it came to my generation, Iassessed the situation this way: myteacher, Merce Cunningham, did notdo what he was taught, he went on tofind a new thing to do; his teacher,Martha Graham, did not do what shewas taught, she found, or she inventeda new way to do it; her teachers, RuthSt Denis and Ted Shawn, did not dowhat their idol, Isadora Duncan, haddone; and Isadora did not do whatanybody had done.This is a very interestingsequence, and it happened in all themodern arts. It meant that therewas a lot of responsibility on partlytrained, immature, aspiring, hopefulartists to invent something new asthey were developing, as they werestill being developed by their teach-ers. In a way, their resistance had tobe grown at the same time, so theydid not simply become a copy of whatthey were taught. This responsibilityis that they had to become like thephoenix, coming out of the ashesof the previous art forms. But itcouldn't be the same phoenix: anew bird had to come.So that was weird. That's thesituation we were in. That's why Idon't encourage anyone to be a dancer,because this is going to be a hardclimb. But if you do, just know thatit's going to take you a long time tomature, and you have to be patientwith yourself, and you will have togo to these classes. You don't haveto like a class, you have to go to itregularly to get your body strong.Plus, that will be a basis for yourhealth for the rest of your life--so, you know--why not?Now, is there something outthere to find? Have we found it all?Doesn't it feel like that? There are somany people and they are so different.Well, where I live--I live ona farm--there is a kitchen with awindow facing south onto a gentlehill and a tree. In the spring, grassgrows there, the tree has blossoms.In the winter, it is snow--we're veryfar north in Vermont--and the treesare bare. Naked, cold trees. And Ilook out everyday, and I feel some-thing. I have been there for fiftyyears, looking out this window, moreor less. I feel something, and what Ifeel is the molecules of that hillside.After all this time, my vision--not myactual eyes--my vision is saying: thisplace is alive. Every bit of it is alive.The dirt is alive. The plants are alive.Every molecule is transforming intosomething else. They get to a certainpoint, they start to decay, they trans-form to something else, they comeup again, the cycle is happening, it'smolecular. I'm seeing it on a molecu-lar level. These molecules are not setin stones. These molecules are adapt-ing and changing. A trillion changesare happening at any one time in myyard. And they're not all happeningin the same way that they've alreadyhappened. The changes are adapting,they are adapting a little bit intosomething else.I'm talking about evolution, ina way; I'm talking about evolutionin miniature, I'm talking about ouratoms, our molecules, changing.We know they do, we know they'vechanged, even though you feel thesame, even though I feel the same, asme, as you, you know you've changed.You are not who you used to be. Norwill you stay who you are now.This is so scary: what am I aboutto say next? I don't know.But, what I have said so far seemsto suggest that you have some abilityto guide what you become as youchange. The change is going to happen.You have a choice. If you want to be adancer, you do the classes. I suggestyou do the classes. You don't haveto. I know one dancer, Simone Forti,who didn't do the classes, but sheis such a genius. I used to see herin Cunningham classes. She wastrying to do the classes, and afterthe classes I would see her on herhands and knees, crawling. I knewthat she needed one more thing,something simple and straightfor-ward, something basic to groundherself again. She is somebody thattasted the dance techniques but wasnot adapted, or compliant enough;too stubborn, maybe. And that's howshe went on developing her own workand ended up at a place that I wouldconsider shamanistic.It's altogether a rather strangething to do, to take a body and to turnit into an art thing. It's one thing tomake art of bodies, of people fighting,of lovers twisting--to make a pictureof it. But to do art with it, what astrange thing. And dance is particu-larly strange because movement is sohard to understand and to describe.I think that's the reason why indance techniques they simplify it, sowhen you study a dance technique,you are studying a small area of whatmovement can be. And if you are thento study martial arts, or Tai Chi, orfolk dance, you have then a differentslice of human movement. What Isaw in Bali, nothing of my dancewas there to be seen.So is there more? I think moreis evolving. I think we are evolving.I think you have to evolve. There's allkinds of evolution. There's what youdo in your life by yourself, as a soloevolver--that's your work. There'syou and your friends, a group of you,how you think, what you think, whatyou agree on, how you present workmaybe. There's the larger culture,gradually moving on. We are allevolving.Now I would like to show a fewvideos that appear in the exhibition.And the first I want to show is Smiling,a dance I made to reflect on facialexpressions in contemporary cultures.In Rome, in 1969, the piece was pre-sented with State, a dance wherepeople stood still, and Satisfyin Lover,a dance which you saw yesterday,where people walk, stand, and sit.I wanted to see what these looklike on stage, I wanted to see theseperformed, I wanted to see standingperformed, not just to happen. Iwanted to see it performed to honorit, but also to see what would happento people doing it. To walk naturally,which is what they are supposed to doin Satisfyin Lover, is not easily done.When I settled upon walking asan artistic formula or medium, I waslooking for something ancient in thebody, I was looking for somethingnot of the culture, but before culture,back to times we could only imagine,and I think walking was a good choice.It's an obvious thing, we do it all thetime. To put it on the stage is whatour culture does: a microscope onwalking, on the people who are walk-ing, on the fact of walking, standing,and sitting. Just as one strata of whatthe body does.I am sure you all know that to bebipedal, to be walking standing uplike this, is not the most normal wayof moving on the Earth and relatingto gravity. It gives us the potentialof using the arms in various ways,but it is unusual. The uprightnessallows for the head to be at the top ofthe body, which means that there isabout seven pounds of mass up there.Playing with that point of balancearound which we are switching sides,head to torso, changing the wayweight falls through the body, andsuddenly we are in ballet, suddenlywe are in Java....I have written a little bookcalled Gravity 1. The reason gravityis important to me as a thoughtform is that gravity is what keepsthe body true. And by true I meanin the sense of carpentry: the fall ofa weight on a string makes its linestraight. The fall of our weight in thebody has the same effect. The fall ofthe organs into the pelvis helps giveus a basis. We can unnecessarily pullthose organs back up and hold theweight high--into a kind of paralysis.But we can also let them fall. In thatcase, it is as though our freedomwas based on our acceptance of itsopposite.Evolution takes a long time andhappens in small elements.For young dancers, despair not.We modestly say: we have only begunto understand, we may not have evenbegun yet. There's lots of chaos andevolution that we have yet to find andsomebody in this room, somebody inthis city, has such potential of devel-opment that they can bring and showus something else.I think that's all I have to say.Thank you for coming.Oh, yes, there's a possibility forquestions.Liliana Courtinho. In one ofthe videos of the exhibition [... in anon-wimpy way... an interview withSteve by Bojana Cvejic and LennartLaberenz], you are in your dancestudio in your farm in NorthernVermont and you say, This is whereI cultivate my pessimism. And so Iwondered: today, you seemed quiteoptimistic. Where do you stand now,between those two options?Steve Paxton. I thought I wasan optimist for many years, but I meta man in Amsterdam, in an interviewsituation, and he asked me a questionthat I thought was so stupid, somethingalong the lines of don't you thinkthings are getting better? At thatpoint, I was much younger than Iam now, but I was already at an agewhere I could say: I know things arejust not getting better, and I don'tknow what to do about it. So I saidto him, No, I don't things are gettingbetter. What about the police, whatabout education, what about nurses,where have you been? Have you beenunder a rock all your life?I realized at that moment thatI was very pessimistic. This wassaddening to me. But I also realized:well, being an optimist doesn't seemto have worked, it doesn't seem tohave helped improve anything; I havebeen told that it's a good thing butwho knows? And so I tried to be apessimist and see how that worked,or see what its conditions were. I havebeen living under these conditionsnow for some time. It's a bitter victory.It's somehow a little bit healthier tohope that things will improve than tohave the bitter confirmation that youare right, that they will not improve.But I'm waiting for the next turn:if I changed once, I am sure I canchange again, if I can find evidencethat something is improving. So:stay tuned.Vera Mantero. Steve, you spenta lot of time in your life buildingand devising very complex, andsometimes mysterious, systems toimprovise. Why is it important foryou to improvise and to createconditions, complicated conditions,to improvise? And I am not thinkinghere about Contact Improvisation,I'm thinking for example of the workyou did with Lisa Nelson, [Nightstand],in which you were exchanging variouskinds of objects; I'm thinking ofsystems that you built in order todo something that you don't knowat first what it's going to be?Steve Paxton. Well, first let metell you that this whole talk was, asI think is pretty clear, an improvi-sation. I worried about it, I thoughtabout it, I was impressed by the factit was going to happen, and that Ishould prepare properly to meetpeople who had come to seriouslylisten, but I didn't set it. It isn't thatI don't care. I hope I have deliveredsomething of substance. But I feelthat those things that can sponta-neously arise when we're together--have more to do with a grace in theroom than with anything I am goingto deliver.So this question of improvisation:I think if you start to improvise, ifyou start to inquire about improvisa-tion, you will end up as I did, askingyourself: I would like to know whatimprovisation is. Of course it is notpossible to not ask this question,but the minute you do that, you areset back for a good couple of years.Instead, I think what you need to dois to look to your life, to look for thoselittle moments when maybe you canobserve yourself without noticingthat you are, and notice that you areimprovising all the time. You justare, you can't stop it, it's part ofeverything you do.You simply don't have enoughconsciousness power to manufac-ture all the events that you create.Consciousness is like the finger here[moving his index inside of his glass],thinking: hmm, what is this glass?What is this water? Hmm, interesting.Consciousness. Meanwhile, all of this[pointing to the rest of his body andaround him], the rest of me, is theunconscious making the conditionsfor this moment to happen, and letthis finger have its way in what it'sinterested in.So, improvisation: how do you dosomething that you don't know youare about to do? I think we shouldeliminate any idea of freedom fromthis discussion. There is no suchthing as freedom, there are alwaysconditions. You may disagree, butif we are dealing with conditions, itmeans we are dealing with things weare not consciously dictating. Thisis what we are doing all the time:coping with situations reflexively,or unthinkingly, or else exploring. Ihaven't decided yet what I am aboutto do and as I am beginning to do it,at some point I am going to make achoice [extending his arms]: how did Iget here? That's short enough that wecould examine it.But if we'd get into a long JurijKonjar improvisation [to the GoldbergVariations], like last night... It startsoff, and you get it for a while, and youcan still track it, but then you get lostin the complexity of the doing, anditjust goes on and on and you end upwith something that is a mountainof detail, that you have somehowabsorbed. For those of you who didn'tsee it yesterday, let me just say that itwas incredibly articulate and intricate.The body was coming apart and goingtogether in so many different waysso fast sometimes that you could nottrack, you could not see where themovement was going to emerge next.What directions he was going to gointo. A complexity. And that wasan hour.I have a friend--Lisa Nelson.She recently did a performance,[End Plays, with Hijack, in NewYork], in which the formula for theperformance was: one person makesa proposal and then says when theproposal stops, then the other per-son makes a proposal and then sayswhen it stops. Three people wereultimately doing this, probably mak-ing a hundred and fifty proposals inan hour, and in that time, the wholestage was transformed. I mean lit-erally transformed: the tables wereupside down, the chairs were moved,the dancers had been everywhereon the stage--and yet they were justgoing through this little formula.Gradually, from that formula, it gotto be an accumulation of detail, likeevolution of life on Earth leading tosomething as particular and outra-geous as [the Australian] Peacockspider--something that whollytransformed the situation. I felt like Ihad taken a mushroom: my thoughtprocess was recognizably hallucinat-ing--from a performance!I felt a little bit like that in theperformance last night as well. Iremember trying to keep hold of onemoment which was so beautiful, andit kept changing, and then anotherremarkable moment happened. Whathad happened in between? Well, itwas too complex to know exactly, andI was straining to recover a reality thatI had just lived through. It is quite astate. A place of ambiguity and lackof anchoring.It works if you care. And Jurijmade me care. I have danced thatdance. I know that dance. I mean, notthat dance--we could have a discus-sion here. That was his dance. But heknows my dance, so somehow it isour dance, to a degree. The questionof authorship of this dance has nowlost all rationality. We have beentalking for four or five years nowabout how is he supposed to relateto the fact that he is doing a danceI did, and yet he is doing his dance.How does he do it?Such an interesting question:how does one decide...? I think it'ssomething about play. You know howit is, you decide, Oh let's take the dayoff, and let's go to the beach, or let'sgo down to the park and run in thegrass. I think it's something aboutplay, and it is a decision we can take.If you go to a studio and you play andyou are serious enough to track whatyou are doing.If you want to improvise, youhave to be aware of the fact thateverything is evolving, nothing isset--set meaning stopped, set mean-ing undeveloped-beyond, which isnot how life seems to work. And yet,it seems to be how culture works.Culture is past-viewing. I mean, whatelse could be agreed upon? You can'tget a million people to agree on thefuture. But you can get most of themto agree on a certain version of thepast, and that becomes the culture,and the artists of that culture arethose who are remembered, and stufflike this museum show of my work isproduced. It's the culture looking atitself and deciding what are themerits of something: Miró,Gauguin, Picasso.Improvisation. I think it issomething you can train yourselfto do, and look for the conditionswith which you want to do it. Andwe also have to recognize that thereare some things for which planningand order and sequencing are betterthan improvisation for achieving. Forinstance: don't improvise your taxes.Anonymous: I am not really adancer. I don't have a dancing back-ground established. I wonder: is therea difference between movement anddance? What did your experience,Steve Paxton: Well I can saythis: I am perfectly willing to eliminatethe word dance from language ifit would help clarify matters. I don'tthink we can do without the wordmovement. But I think we could getalong without the word dance.How the word dance is usefulis when people are trying to expressthe state or the change of state thatten years of study, and the focus on acertain aesthetic, produces in a body.Maybe in my mind I call it adance because of the perspectivethat I have. And if that's a perspectivethat others don't have, I am willing togive up the fight. All I want to do is toexpand the extent of consciousness. Iknow that the brain has many priori-ties, and that our casual movement isnot part of its high priorities. I knowthat with walking, especially if youare walking and thinking about what'son your list, the mechanism of howyou are getting yourself to whereyou are going is not a priority. That'swhat got me wondering: how doesmy body do it? How does it get mearound? What is the support systemto which I don't ever give a holiday?Sure, sometimes I take it out to eat,give it a good dinner. But still, thatunacknowledged thing that we haveto support the me that you thinkyou are, I think of that as a dance.And if I think of that as a dance, Ican think of the minutia of thatsmall dance, of those tiniest littlemovements.uTo read the full transcript ofSteve's talk, go to CQ Unboundon www.contactquarterly.comFor more information on the exhibition,you can obtain the catalogue, StevePaxton: Drafting Interior Techniques,available on booksonthemove.eu. Theexhibition will be travelling to AzkunaCentroa in Bilbao, Spain, from FebruaryAt the invitation of choreographer/curator Meg Stuart, I created a six-part text for Tanzkongress 2019held June 5-10 at the Festspielhaus Hellerau, in Dresden, Germany. TK2019, subtitled A Long LastingAffair, offered a communal and praxis-based approach to contemporary questions in dance. TK2019 receivedsignificant funding from the German Federal Cultural Foundation and included workshops and creativepropositions to 600 participants.Excerpted here are three sections from the text, which I performed with collaborative commentary froma group of invited artists, already in attendance at TK2019. Designed as a dancing-word manifesto--fiveparts with script and one entirely improvised--I read each section and then turned to the invited artists fortheir elaboration/response. We discussed ideas with one another and with the other attendees. Then we allmoved about in the immense grand hall while stagehands manipulated beautiful, massive tables, designedby Doris Dziersk, into novel arrangements for each section.Sections in order of presentation: anthropocene :: aesthetics :: globalizations :: queer entanglements:: fear-mongering :: shame.Invited artists included Salamata Kobré, Stephany Ursula Yamoah, Fatou Cissé, Ligia Lewis, Trajal Harrell,Dana Michel, Jens Giersdorf, Eike Wittrock, Sonya Lindfors, Niall Jones, Ni'Ja Whitson, Keith Hennessy,Ishmael Houston-Jones, and Joy Mariama Smith. --T.DF.[1]we move, too much, too quickly, too often. we forget tocare. we aren't nearly so clever as we thought we would be.our future is not promised. but then, the future has alwaysbeen Black.the [Black] anthropocenewe start with the planet. often, we claim indigeneity. thepeople who came before. the ancestors as destiny. in theunited states we do this more and more. the event beginswith the calling forth of the ground. and the people whocame before. we write it down on our websites; we try tolearn to pronounce the names. but the planet rebels. wesee the problem, immediately. the past is fucked up. butwe get nowhere by ignoring it.the past is fucked up. full of missteps and things we thinkwe want to do better. contemporary performance issupposedly a new new, a politicized version of what camebefore, possibly designed with the planet in mind. whatcould a performance be that actually considered, say,carbon footprint or generations of genocide? well, not thisone. we gather here in Dresden with a huge footprint andas though the fact of social and political disavowals andexclusions matter little, or not enough to slow us evenmore. we move too fast. the anthropocene offers dis-course for the turn to the inevitable self-centeredness thatcharacterizes too much of contemporary performance. inthe anthropocene our gestures matter, because they payforward to a world that actually cares about what we do,here and now. the caring is a by-product of necessity:species are wiped out because we build a new performancecenter; there is crass exploitation of materials to makea great show with an extravagant mise-en-scene--liveanimals; decaying sod; an entire building destroyed beforeyour very eyes. in the anthropocene we take the lead bydoing things: dancing, shitting onstage and fucking,trying to elicit empathetic response.the anthropocene fully embraces the performative turn.what and how become one; what we do and how we do itindicate the terms of understanding our influences, inter-ferences, and entanglements. things are dark. meltingice, flooded lands, forced migrations as places becomeunlivable. well, unlivable for us, now, at least. clean water,which was only ever a nominal affordance of the planet,is now disrupted beyond measure by a reliance on plasticand oil, energy coerced to a mass scale.but we still resist the potential of small performances,small intimacies, privacies not distended but rathercared for as minor gestures. we still build hierarchies andbig-up toward celebrity and notoriety. we move too fast.we want--and the wanting becomes solipsistic desire forapproval, affirmation, and acknowledgment of my pain;the me of me, what happened to me?, what I know, whatI figured out, what I can do, watch me work, get out ofmy way.mentoring, teaching, responding to younger artists; wewitness the wanting to matter. emerging artists want tobe seen and regarded. the anthropocene tells us that weall matter, but we can't believe that. the anthropoceneoffers evidence in unprecedented weather: fires, tornados,heat waves, droughts, floods. all at once. in response towhat we do. in the age of human intervention in climate.the anthropocene turns us toward destruction, a self-immolation born of all this need and want. as artistsand critics, we rank among the neediest of all, wantingothers to care that we can shake, scream, stretch, orrefuse to acknowledge someone else's concerns nomatter the movement at hand. we author this anthropo-cene willingly; creating, making, making over, re-doing,doing. trying to be noticed, noticeable, worthy.and we want strangers to care. that seems a lot to ask.a Black anthropocene might recognize the inevitabilityof change as necessary to a life cycle. as inevitable as aninherent lack of control over one's physical trajectory,even when things seem sort of okay. for Black people,the anthropocene is a bit like payback being a bitch: youcan jack off all you want, but at some point, your bodywon't produce fluids or much more than pain. the planethurts, as it tries to sustain all of the growing populace'sunquenchable desires. Black pain, though, is inevitable,and sacrifice comes before any sense of identity oridentity politic.the future has always been black as the population grows,and we fail to comprehend and act on questions of scale.do we really need to be global artists, showing work on sixcontinents? what could it mean to explore a lighter touch,to resist piling on to the jockstraps and menstrual bloodof famous artists from before? or the tyrannies of fakereenactment and vacuous historicizing that reifies a fakecaring about false pasts? the planet rebels. will we scorchthe sky?the anthropocene wonders if we will accelerate its termssimply because we can't figure out how to do any better.or, if we might acknowledge its constant shadow thatexpands as we leak our desire into rank unruliness. weparticipate in it willy-nilly; especially when we dance toprove supremacy.a Black anthropocene is, of course, art-making. daily livesmade up of valuing gesture and detail, noting change,growth, and variety as a way of being present now. survivalas an outgrowth of willful creativity. working Black meansworking willfully towards a structured obsolescence, onethat will destroy the category that defines it if all goes well.we work toward the end of a need for Black, but only asBlack becomes what we are all willing to be, what we areall able to be, what we all might understand in some way.we've already scorched the earth and each other trying todominate. the anthropocene is about human domination,but a Black anthropocene could be about making our wayback towards each other, valuing history as possibilityand a way to share current circumstances. the people whocame before left because they had to. we'll have to, soon,as well. but we don't have to leave our marks. i don't thinkwe do. we could learn to listen. shhhh.what is to be done? how do we move toward an alongside-ness or an adjacency that allows for expansion, ratherthan only constrictions?[3]we move, too much, too quickly, too often. we forget tocare. we aren't nearly so clever as we thought we would be.our future is not promised. but then, the future has alwaysbeen Black.photo © Charlotte Spichalskyglobalizationsit's amazing that we are from all over. that we can gather,however briefly, just long enough to see each other andshare tales of woe. the future is black, we tell each other,but then the future has always been Black.in traveling we learn something of difference, really; of theorderliness of one place and the abundant chaos of another,as in the Tanzkongress here, of the messiness of socialstrains in one neighborhood next to the leafy green happi-ness of a children's space near the bar. traveling, we cantake the time to notice that these venues are similar butunique; that audiences are not undifferentiated masses.that it matters who turns up to see or be involved in theperformance, and it matters who will never come see theshow. as the planet's population expands, every day thereare more and more people who will never witness ourcreative explorations or wonder at the questioning throughperformance that drives our devotions to dance.thinking globally means shifting our attention toward thedifficult considerations of scale that trouble our under-standings of planet, climate, entanglement. these are notsimple concerns to hold. when we are in the dance studioin the small town outside of Berlin, or in Helsinki, whatdoes that have to do with the people chaining themselvesto a police station in Oakland as a performance of defianceto a rising police state? What does me practicing yoga, ordancing salsa, have to do with religious and racial conflictin Sri Lanka?globalization as a process encourages us to forgetdifference and settle into a numbing sameness, whereevery dance is available so long as it can be subsumedinto a locale that denies its specificities. yes, we can yoga atHellerau, and we can kathak in Santiago, and of coursetango in Copenhagen. globalization needs to create smoothterrain that allows for a simultaneity and a sameness,promised as an availability and access for all--well, forthose who have time and the resources/privilege tospend energy on other people's stuff.and globalization is something about eating the other,to quote an older academic text; it might be a leaning intoward desire for difference, and especially an exoticizeddifference that stays unknown and out of proximity. weneed things to be different in order to rhapsodize overtheir superficial contents; we need to be able to not reallyknow what's going on in the Bronx in order to fetishizeand become expert voguers in Hamburg.we forget to care. but we think we can try, and we gatherfrom hither and yon, and we have salons and mini-confer-ences, and we meet, and we imagine that we communicateand connect even when it is sloppy and ill-advised butwe are all artists here, and that must mean that we sharesomething about a willingness to be outside a mainstream,and we must be able to meet there, here, in a place beyondplace, an imaginary place of a long-lasting affair, but anaffair, not a marriage, with the asymmetries bared throughtime, but an affair to remember, a being with where theground could tremble because we try and we want, we wantit to work, we want it to be possible a bit, that we could bealongside each other and not just eat each other up.but then, we would have to learn to listen. and to notice.and to allow for globalization to mean more difficultconversations and discourse, not just more varied. someof us need to fight in our everyday at home, to fight hardwhile others of us don't. we're not aligned just because weare in the same room. we have to fight to actually be heretogether, in our differences that we fight to maintain.in creating global-aware spaces, like this year's Tanz-kongress, so much--so very much--has to be disregardedand elided. for this event to even happen, we have to pre-tend that it is okay to be called into the room and to comeforth; to represent without representing; to be Black andawash in difference even as we are all artists here. this isthe promise of a Black future, though, that this could bepossible. watch us closely. we meet here, and bring ourselves,yes, but can also demonstrate how to leave so much behind,out of reach and unavailable; to leave the Black home ata distance and still survive, smile, make bookings, anddance. we do this all the time, and demonstrate that it canbe done. globalization is possible, and a weird Black othercan still be produced inside of it. at what cost? that wedon't yet know, not really.are all ideas really available to us all? which people fall outof these emergent global orderings?what is to be done? how do we move towards an alongside-ness or an adjacency that allows for expansion rather thanonly constrictions?[5]we move, too much, too quickly, too often. we forget tocare. we aren't nearly so clever as we thought we would be.our future is not promised. but then, the future has alwaysbeen Blackwhen Obama was elected, we noted that gun sales in theUS increased exponentially, supposedly because someamericans assumed that laws against guns would finallybe strengthened a bit; that didn't happen, and insteadwe've just seen more and more mass shootings as morefancy and unexpected firearms find their way to a generalpublic. after Obama left office my husband suggested wearm ourselves against the coming deluge. be afraid. bevery afraid.in France the security at the performances has heightenedafter Paris, after Nice, after Berlin; we stand in line for bagsearches and spot checks; if the company is from Israel weare handled more roughly. we wait in long lines. i don't feelany safer. the people hired to secure our space are afraidtoo; and maybe they have done this before, this guardingthe audience at the dance concert, or the theater, butthey didn't survive Paris, or Nice, or Berlin at christmas,because if they had they wouldn't be here, this is no wayto live no way to make a living no way to go see a showthat means to uplift us because the world is scary and ofcourse a performance will take that away, take away thepain, offer a vista of something else. why would the per-formance just heap more fear and anxiety and confusiononto something already wrecked, already scary? we needthe dance to remind us of grace, and goodwill amongmen, but that's not allowed, I'm afraid, it's not allowedto be an experimental artist who doesn't experiment; beafraid that there is less and less space to be an artist whopleases the public, but who ever wanted to please thepublic? those are the wannabe fake artists who are reallyentertainers who want the people to feel good about them-selves; that is not allowed, it is not allowed to feel safe inthe theater or in the improvisation; it is not allowed to feelgood about yourself, only yourself, because who does that?we are afraid. we move too fast, and too often, afraid tofly or crash land, afraid of the terrorists on the train or inthe theater; or at the music concert in Las Vegas or on thebeach in Ivory Coast.what are you afraid of?that there won't be a job, there isn't a job; that the hier-archies that keep some people in place will never move,the old people will never retire, we will be stuck. I will bestuck. the old people keep coming back and there's no roomfor me for me for meeeeeee to find myself as an artist asa maker as an interpreter, as me not you. I'm afraid thatI won't be able to be me, because you'll be in the way.you're always in the way, the world keeps changing thegame keeps changing. we move too fast. it doesn't changeenough. we waste time with our elders when we should bejust doing shit ourselves, because we want to. i want to. doshit. my own shit. i'm afraid you won't let me do my ownshit. who are you to me?why do i have to know about you? why should i care? i'mafraid to care, i'm afraid i'll never fall in love, and i'll neverhave a relationship i can recognize, i want a fuckmate whowill always be there ready to fuck, ready to love i mean. i'mafraid there won't be anyone, there will only be #metoo,and i will be one of the three who are sexually assaultedamong us, look left look right, one of we three, i'm afraidto be one of the three and that i won't have health care,i won't have an abortion, it's not allowed in the unitedstates, it's not allowed anymore. i'm afraid i can't raisea child i'm afraid i can't afford, there are no jobs, i won'tbe able to live somewhere long term, i don't think longterm. i'm afraid there's no contingency plan that promisestomorrow, tomorrow is not promised.tomorrow was never promised. Black lives matter. exceptwhen they don't, usually. i'm afraid i don't understand racethe way the americans talk about it. i don't understand.i'm afraid i don't care.i'm afraid of a tomorrow without.without any of the things of today, which is already fuckedup, but here we are, i'm afraid of a tomorrow that can'tpossibly make any sense unless it's more of the bullshitthat we have now and here and here and now, that wealready know is broken but we pretend that it's sort ofokay even though lots of us are camping in tents on themuddy ground outside of here, but there are Africanrefugees who can't even get into here and we should alljust fucking be done with it and fucking move to fuckingPoland. just move. just move.what is to be done? how do we move towards an alongside-ness or an adjacency that allows for expansion rather thanonly constrictions?re-mapping. and afterwards, a turn toward a future lookingthat includes Black looks.

The Future Has Always Been Black.How did you get to this point?We were supposed to meet in Vienna during the 6thIDOCDE (International Documentation of Contem-porary Dance Education) Symposium1 called You are here,hosted at ImPulsTanz Festival Vienna 2018. Leading up tothe symposium, we were invited for a weeklong residencycalled Mind the Dance. The theme of the residency wasartistic and reflective practices in dance documentation.One of us didn't make it to Vienna. To this day, we haveactually never physically met, but nonetheless, we havebeen collaborating since the initial point of the residency.What came out of this initial never meeting during theresidency at ImPulsTanz?Well, resonating with the overall theme of the symposium(You are here), the physical distance between you and meshaped our collective research: 2 How were we going tocollaborate without ever physically meeting? After ourfirst sessions--conducted through Skype, email, andWhatsApp--we determined a time frame, possible scores,and tasks for the project. We distilled our conversationsand experiences into the following topics: Absence ofthe other, Fiction of the other, and Space in betweeneach other.• AbsenceWhat does a trace tell us about a missing process?How do we create and feel together in the absence ofthe others?Can we wonder and wander 3 with an absence of directionor specific intent?Do we need to see/sense traces of one who is absent in orderto experience them?• FictionAllows me to imagine the place you are in, which bridges thegap/absence/in-between-ness of another• Space in betweenLike the suspended leg before the next stepInspired by The Go-To How-To Book of Anarchiving,4 weapproached these key topics anarchivally. Rather thandocumenting the content of the event, anarchival pro-cesses capture traces of the event's liveness, which mightset the stage for a next event to occur. We thought ofmovement tasks and perception scores that could beperformed simultaneously in our respective spaces. Wedocumented, traced, and recorded them. The traces ofthese tasks and scores led the research process into newprocesses, becoming a digital/virtual/tactile collage ofwhat happened.A Movement ScoreMove in the memory of someone else's actions...You have not seen this/these person(s), nor their actions.You have never been close physically to this/these person(s).You haven't inhabited the same place.Yet you are sharing the same process.Wander and wonder...For 6 or 60 minutesThank you for sharing your process. And how did youcommunicate your research with the public during theIDOCDE symposium?As a form of presentation, we invited participantsfrom the IDOCDE symposium to step into our ongoingresearch. We set up the space with a 4 x 5m live projectionof you (who joined the whole session via Skype) and ananarchival pathway on the floor consisting of the printedpages of The Go-To How-To Book of Anarchiving. Scoresstemming from our research and written on colored cardsled and guided the group into a participatory anarchivalprocess by which participants created new traces andlived in the becoming of those events and its traces. It isimportant to mention that all anarchival processes havesome sort of sharing.Research presentation scoreWonder and wander for...Enter the space separately.Prepare your space. Prepare the space. Or start the process.Make the choice to discover the whole space or yourown space.Make choices as a result of other people's choices.Leave the space or enter a new space.Focus on distinct senses.At any moment you can observe (active reception) orcontribute (active generation).Attend to the moments when there is some thingcrystallizing.Be aware when you are  feeling (experiencing) and whenyou are performing your feeling (making visible yourexperience).Collect artifacts and bring them into the space.You are always part of the score/event, no matter if you arein or out of the space in which the event is being held.As mentioned above, traces have become essential for yourresearch. Can you describe more precisely what you meanwhen you talk about traces?Traces are, in essence, an anarchive of experiences thatcannot be fully possessed due to their ephemerality butcan be impulses to push the research further. In ananarchival sense, traces are the tip of the iceberg. Atrace is multiple:A trace is formless memory (of an event).A trace is a mediator in the proof of our existence for another.A trace is a container, a snapshot, leftover coffee drips on theedge of a paper cup.A trace limits the past's unlimited potential to unfold inthe future.Our lives are composed of traces, outlines, pathways,images, sketches, memories, narratives.Everything is a trace of something else. Not all traces aremeant to last forever.It's the letter left behind asking:What makes you real? I want to challenge the limits ofgetting closer and closer but not meeting. Maybe gettingcloser is weaving a web with more and more connectingstrings. Getting closer is cumulative. Getting closer is tobecome more and more relational to each other. What ifa body is defined by its capability to build relations withother bodies?And how did the idea come up to continue the project afterthe residency?We were enchanted with how to encounter another with-out ever sharing the same time/space. Our imaginationand fictional projection of each other provided a potentspace to work from. After Deleuze and Derrida, who bothreconciled presence and absence no longer as oppositesbut rather as a related and interchangeable pair,5 wewondered: How do we move in the present absence of theother where these binary terms actually switch roles andabsence becomes a different kind of presence? Wecontinued asking questions:How can we trace each other's absent movements?How can we activate the other's absence throughimmaterial traces?What does a trace tell us about the other's absence?What do we share in the other's absence?What is the physicality of absence?From this point, we needed to find shared tasks/objectsthat served as connecting mediators. We set up collectivereading times. We picked the same book--in this case,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval NoahHarari--to read at the same time, in separate places.We created a 30-day/30-second dance score. Every day,individually, we instantly composed a 30-second danceand filmed it. We then sent these dances to each other.We sent unfinished stories via post for each other to finish.These collected and created traces became the material tocontinue the forward-feeding process for our performanceinstallation in Amsterdam, also called You are here.Would you describe the set-up for the performanceinstallation You are here?In January 2019, we had the opportunity to share ourresearch with passersby in a semi-public performancespace in the de Pijp neighborhood of Amsterdam.6 Sincewe were both in Amsterdam, our spatial proximity wasincreasing. We inhabited the same exhibition space (a formershop window) separately at different times over a periodof five days, for five hours each day. First, you wouldinhabit for two and a half hours. I would come in after youhad left, for another two and a half hours. We'd continuethis cycle each day. The shop window served as a thresholdof in-betweenness from inside to outside, from private topublic. It allowed for transparency to flow between innerand outer spaces. Each day we arranged and rearrangedobjects, materials, and our bodies; we wrote letters andleft notes for each other; we used different materials, likechalk, string, tape, and paper, while performing in andwith the present absence of the other. Our performancesaccumulated material and immaterial traces of eachother's absence. Words became a medium to describethe visibility of one and the invisibility of the other.Wait a second, you just mentioned that written andspoken words became a medium to connect to eachother's absence. Can you further elaborate on that?Sure. Let's say in language there are always multiple voicesthat weave through time continuums of present, past, andfuture. Reading your notes, memories, or stories articulatedyour past through my present/future. Your thoughtsexpanded in reverberation with my body's presence. Theyvibrated through my skin. They vibrated through spaceand through the architecture of the window. As I projectinto your future, you sit in my past.And what about movement? How did you expand yourbodily presence into the presence of each other's absence?Sometimes moving in stillness was my only response;sometimes I moved by imagining how you might havemoved before me. But indeed, moving in the memory ofsomeone you have never met--or moving with an inten-tion of layering movements upon the absence of another--was quite challenging. Through the material traces youleft behind, I tried to imagine your immaterialized bodychoreographies. I found myself measuring my body inorder for you to have a sense of my size. Maybe that couldbe the closest trace of my physicality. The performancespace was filled with pieces of string naming body partsor the relation between body parts--connecting points,separating surfaces. Connecting us? Movements them-selves are untraceable. How do I leave movements behind,untethered to any trace, piece of paper, string, chalk,or words? How to move in, from, and with the presentabsence of the other?Do you want to share any other insights you had during theperformance or its reverberations?In line with Derrida's conception of presence and absenceas something beyond a static binary that once connectedpresence to an absolute truth or origin, and absence toimitation or copy,7 I experienced absence and presenceas being in a blurry, occasionally confusing relationshipwith each other--not defined by opposition. Rather, theyare layered into each other; they are autonomous fromeach other as much as they are not; absence and presencedo not follow linear measurements. Absence activatesdifferent experiences of time. As I am writing you thisletter, I project into your future. When you read the letter,you sit in my past. Since we developed shared tasks thathappened at the same time but in different places, and inthe same place but at different times, we swam in the seaof temporalities, where past, present, and future actionsmerged, overlapped, and intertwined.During the five-day performance, both of you were stayingin Amsterdam. What would have happened if you hadaccidently bumped into each other?I guess we would have turned around and run away as fastas possible. I can also imagine that we would just standstill. Take a moment. Then turn around and walk quietlyin opposite directions.One last question: How would you describe the relationshipyou have been building (while never meeting) during thepast year?I would describe our relationship as one of disorientationrather than anything linear, and in that, a tremendousamount of closeness has developed. As I wander in my steps,an imagination of you is by my side. With you, I come closerto sensing the multiplicity of time/events. These conditionscreate an experimental context to train trust, care, andsolidarity; a way of being-with and working together thatexceeds boundaries of space and time and quantifiablemeasurements. Proximity and distance are playfullyentangled, without seeking to close the gap between us.Our research group consisted of Ilana Reynolds (US/GER)and Sabrina Huth (GER), as well as John Taylor (NL) andNicolas Hubert (FR), who supported the research process.3 Dutch curator, writer, and researcher Christel Vestersexplores the potential of wandering as an alternative wayof knowing and being in the world. According to Vesters,Wanderlust refers to a curiosity-driven mindset, the longingto discover uncharted terrain without a settled plan or fixedobjective. Guided by chance, the figure of the Wandererembraces whatever they come across. It is in this sense thatart and literature both adopted the figure of the Wanderer asthe personification of the romantic, free spirited, the unboundvagabond. However, there is a dark and dystopian side to thefigure of the Wanderer as well--the Wanderer who is not onlygeographically lost but also mentally disoriented; lost in theirown mind, their own way of thinking, their own logic.

It is located at the corner of FerdinandBolstraat, not far from the crossing with the Ceintuurbaan.The public for this window includes passing shoppers, children,tourists, and art lovers. The window is a platform for artists tocreate an installation specifically for this location. The narrowinsular space in relationship to the street is a new startingpoint for each exhibition. 7 Bell, Absence/Presence.MargitI'm interested in talking specifically about how imagesform and have been informed by your dance life, and alsohow the particular ways of relating to image through yourexperience of Skinner Releasing and then later throughthe practice of Amerta Movement have affected yourrelationship with your moving body.SallySo I guess the first thing that stands out was I started withSkinner Releasing, and about the same time I was doing alot of butoh (with Joan Laage), and they somehow overlap.At that time, the experience with my moving body hadvery much a sense of disappearing.In order to blend or merge with an image introducedfrom outside myself, I needed to slowly release tension,and then to disappear in order to become the image.More recently, I've realized through the Amerta practicethat I can merge with an image without disappearing.I have a very specific memory while doing the OngoingSkinner Releasing Training, after working with Prapto inJava, where I could sense both my body and an image atthe same time, which was new for me. Amerta changed myrelationship to my moving body as well as how I receivethe image.The other thing is: Where is the image coming from?In Skinner Releasing, the image comes through the poetryof the language. In butoh, images come through differentsensorial experiences and can be nonverbal--looking at apicture in a book, entering a nature environment, smellinga flower.Prapto's work has both a sense of the dream worldand the reality world--there's a sense of more materialitythere in the image. I think this was the point when theimage started to transform into a costume for me. It wasmy way of creating poetry, a kind of material poetry. Sothe image, or the costume, came from the moving bodyitself, as opposed to somebody's words. It became morenonverbal, something I can touch, something I can feel.Images can live in the verbal realm and in the nonverbalrealm. I can disappear and the image takes over, or Ican sense the image with my body, existing in thehere and now.MargitCould you share your experience of that moment wherebody and image came together?SallyI can't remember the specific image. I don't know if it wasferns, I'm not sure, but the sense of it is a spirally imagethrough my body. At the same time, I could feel and sense,and maybe even see, the bones, the muscles, the tissues,the cells. They didn't feel separate; they just felt more likea unified meeting. It wasn't the body trying to find theimage or the image trying to find the body; they werejust existing.I feel it kinesthetically, or in my body, so it can endup being a quality, but it's still an image, and it cantransform.LilyIn Skinner Releasing, what I experienced right away wasthere was this immediacy of the kinesthetic experience ofthe image. I could immediately feel it in my body. When Iwas in dance school, I thought that everybody else had alot of fantasy. I didn't have those kind of stories, and I wasworried about it. [laughing]When I experienced working with anatomical imagery(the first time was Release and Alignment Technique withJohn Rolland, an ideokinetic approach), it gave me moretrust that there is a different kind of sensorial imaginationthat for me is immediately in the body; not so much a storythat I'm telling with my body. So it's more like a poeticapproach to me. There is this sense of expanding possibil-ity through images, and this sense of poetic experience inmy body as it is, or as it may be. Which then can transformit. This is hard to put in words and beyond what the actualmatter of it is....Something that came up yesterday when I was inthe studio was the imagination of an image, because I feelthere is a difference between image and the imagination.There are overlaps, but there is a difference actually.Sometimes the imagination of the image is so, in a way,beyond the body that I can feel the limitations of my body,my physical body, moving. And sometimes, like yesterday,I didn't feel those limitations even though I was awareof them in the space. That my arms, like the fingertips,are in a certain place in the space as I move, yet with myimagination, they might be much farther out there. I loveit when I don't feel the limitation of my physical abilities.[laughing] And I feel also that practicing, for example,Skinner Releasing helps me to be more able to expand myphysical abilities.There is a spaciousness and an expanding. Layers,also. And then there is also the immediacy of listening.Like, what is the image? There is this stillness involved.Or silence perhaps. In the chapter that I submitted for thebook about Skinner Releasing Technique, I write aboutlistening and poetry. Listen and silent have thesame letters.I like what you said, Sally, about how in SkinnerReleasing, poetic language is the source of the image. I amin love with the use of poetry in SRT. I keep using the wordimmediacy with what I feel; maybe that's why theseimages work so well for me.I realize I don't think of Amerta in image, with image,in relation to image. It's not a first connection I make.MargitWhat would you call it instead, Lily?LilyThe first thing that comes up is making connections. Orfinding the connections that are already there and experi-encing them. And what do these connections mean in mydancing life, body, being? People, nature, tree. Sculpture.Me. Sun. Rest of the world. [laughing] But then it couldalso be a connection between an image that I have ofmyself or an image I have of the world. In that sense,image is there.JulieAn early experience in the Skinner Releasing world, itcould have been yesterday: dancing with an image, therewas poetic image and there is also touch from anotherperson, which is also a form of image--landing, andtaking you, and the body...But now I'm feeling that the experience is actuallyof novelty--like a feeling of surprise. There's a thing thatSally: Integrating SRT and Amerta, I have begunto tap a multifaceted dance between body andimage. Body and image can appear/disappear;breathing between material/immaterial land-scapes, hovering between verbal/nonverbalrealms, embodying and evoking sensation/imagination, received and activated throughmovement/stillness. The location of imagesshapes the moving body's experience--whetherarising inside, outside, or in between body andimage. Somatic Costumes are a bridge; whenworn, a costume is experienced as inside thebody through touch and outside the body throughexternal form. Costume offers poetic materiality.Lastly, an image may be static or moving--alive.Image is always in-forming if it's alive. It nevercompletes the process of forming itself.Julie: I hold the question of what fresh images arise while sitting in open atten-tion to where-I-sit. In this, the technique of Skinner meets the river of Amerta,the genius of places speaking. A quality of seeing, wherein what is caught in thepoint of sight is received as itself doing the speaking. The mobile, angled bonesof pelvis, shoulder, [index] finger, that reference self and world. Fluted pointsmade by Gayogohono people, present and original inhabitants of this land. Aspecific image seems to live a long life within before taking form in the mouth.comes to mind that playing is what gives us the ability torespond to surprise, so we end up surprised by somethingthat is open, that is opening--something from outsideof what we anticipate or remember in our experience. Ido think about image and the play of image as being thisunique and momentary confluence of implicit consciousmemory and explicit memory, as the micro-fibers of mem-ory momentarily come together and blossom inside myselfor another. Kinesthetic experiences or life experiences,that each time it's new. I think this kind of image is verypersonal, and something about that action of the imagein the dancer, in myself, is one of experiencing wholeness.That experience of my body as whole. And then also, attimes, this thing occurs, which I connect with SkinnerReleasing but is not unique to it, that is the interplay ofself and context. The dissolution of distinction may be onearea I get more of in Amerta. And I suspect that's becauseso much is there--being (moving) in nature, in humanculture--that the immediacy of wind or of a dialoguewith another has more than the tactile, which can also bethe possibility of understanding...across distinctions ordifferences.My sense of how image is working in Amerta feelsvery much about the sensations of the place, the questionsof the place, where we are.The way I understand space as an image in SRTis that it connects with bodily roots of knowing andpossibility. I feel like the image of space is like an anchorthat actually helps bridge back to something that thebody knows.SallyThere was something, when you were talking aboutspace, Julie, that I really relate to in connection withSkinner Releasing. And then when I think about imagewith Amerta practice, I feel it's much more about theplace. With Skinner Releasing, I'm feeling an image andseeing it in my body as I'm moving. There is this clearpoetic language given to me that I'm experiencing, and it'slike I'm arriving in the space; my body feels the languagesomehow.And then I have this memory of being on Prapto'sland in Mojosongo. I remember moving, and all of a sud-den it felt like my body was reappearing. I could sense mybones, and then all of a sudden my muscles, and then Icould sense my breath kind of circulating in a completelydifferent yet concrete way. Just moving in that place, theimage appeared through the visceral and kinesthetic.Image isn't the first word I associate with Prapto'swork, unless he does something very simple connectedto the body: feel your feet coming from the earth. Thenit's more connected to my sense of the way I experienceimage work and Skinner Releasing. Instead, I experiencePrapto's languaging and practices more like symbols. I'mgiven symbols: oval, circle, square. [laughing] They can beimages, but they have all these layers of meaning that arerelated to place, culture, and an idea of the world. It affectsmy body through a different process.LilyJulie, you said the word opening, and it's actually oneof the main words that I usually connect to what I exper-ience in using imagery and with Skinner Releasing.Opening, and opening into opening, this is how I've beendeveloping my own imagery. And that has to do withexpanding. And I think there is something interesting;now that I have been practicing this approach for so longand it's in my daily practice, I'm connecting more to ana-tomical information. I'm more excited when I read somethings about BMC [Body-Mind Centering] or craniosacralpractice. I can tune into my own body more easily thanbefore. It took me another process first to be able to makesome kind of sense of it--that this is a natural fact...but, just to use words. I had to enter and tune in fromanother angle.48 CONTACT QUARTERLYWINTER/SPRING 2020MargitMy experience of how I relate to embodiment has to dowith qualities, texture, form, color, flow, and weight. Thesethings are experiential, sensorial, or energetic. I've hadexperience through BMC, with what Bonnie BainbridgeCohen calls somatization, where you see a picture of theanatomic process, then you move with it, and it becomesunderstood through somatic integration. When you'repracticing SRT, what actually is it that's being developed?How does the image develop? Is it material? Is it a qualityfor movement?LilyI used the word connections with Amerta, but I also feelthat a lot in Skinner Releasing--this connection betweenmy physical dancing body and what's beyond that, bothinside and outside, and integrating; feeling the onenessof that.MargitHow is that arising?LilyPerhaps one way is through the practice of integratingthe inner awareness of an image and your relation to theoutside so that both happen at the same time. So thatthese boundaries become thinner, or they may disappear.One area where I feel they are disappearing more is withwhat is called a totality image--where you merge withthe image. So then there is this sense of oneness as well asdifferentiation and refinement within.MargitI think about how Prapto talks about sensory motor, notjust sensory. Is kinesthetic experience bodily? What isthe relationship between an image and something havingform? How does an image get formed? From where doesthat form arise? There's a process of turning into some-thing and coming into its clarity. Becoming formulated.And an image is just maybe the initiatory process fromwhich that forming takes place.Lily: Pak Prapto speaks about being perceived while we dance.Indonesia helps with this. There is willingness to see me. I feel easilyperceived. By the land, the green, by sea, the people who live there,by sky, path, ancestors, by tree and its long life, its intrinsic wisdom,by shells who washed ashore and resettled. By what is beyond all that.I am not alone. And through this I feel this is not about me. It neveris. While simultaneously, by feeling perceived, I feel included. Beingperceived expands any image of the dance. Even if there is no image.JulieWhen I think about my urge to make a dance, my idiosyn-cratic way that I want to make a dance is very often fromsome kind of image. The guidance often shows up fromthe specific image, and that is the placeholder of all themultiplicity of directions that I could go. It can just unfold,elaborate, and guide, to keep things from becoming justlimitless; so it forms. So I get to find something out, and inAmerta work it seems to be OK, but what are you going todo? What is your application? In Releasing, I technicallylearn how to unfold, go inside of something; instead ofbeing on the outside, I can go in. And then I can inhabitthis space, and this was the transition for me in Releasing--the question was, What is in the space? And that seemedto be the propulsion from working with somebody else'simages into beginning to recognize the presence of otherimages and what the quality of the image was so that itcould be mined, or explored, or sat inside of. That feelslike something that is a process of creation.STREAMSMargitHow is image developing through your own work? Whereis the meaning for you now, and how is it filtered throughthese influences?SallyDeveloping the Somatic Costume work has been one ofmy key practices in developing my relationship to image:How can I guide myself/others between facts/fictions,the reality/dream world and the material/immaterial?Images became more material. For example, the FurryHeart Protector costume came from the poetry of natureand my moving body. When moving with stones on thebeach I began putting stones on my body. Sensing theweight, the texture, the quality of the stones, I realized Ineeded something to protect my heart. I started makinga costume by taping stones on the front and the back ofmy heart. In that process, I thought, Ah, OK, I understandwhen Prapto said 'Sally, please don't just sense the frontof the heart; sense also the back of the heart and the placein between.' With stones now on my body, I could experi-ence what he was saying. The image was touching me.LilyFor me it is in my daily practice, in my training. I literallystart my day with going into an image in my body, andthrough that, the images develop; so it's not necessarilythe image from Skinner Releasing, but it comes from therebecause it is what I've been practicing for so long. So theimages are developing continuously through my dailypractice. I also taught workshops where I used imagesthat I developed further, from the practice and my teach-ing. This is something I do to be in tune with my body andwith the world, with the reality of the imagination: theexperience of expansion. Working with stillness has beendeepened by my practice of SRT, particularly some imagesthat I was very moved by in the beginning. Now, in mywork, I am working more radically with stillness. So it'sdirectly influencing my work.JulieI feel pretty far from Skinner Releasing, but if I can sort ofcredit what I feel, the tone of being in the world of imageand movement, or image and action, connects with thatsort of power to draw from multiple sources at once. Myimmediate response right now is personal; I'm writing,doing photography, mapping, and working with fabric.In my weekly practice of going outside and dancingcontinuously for one hour, the encounter is more withall of that memory but also the immediacy of ice, snow,wind, perfume, moments of performativity.uENDNOTE1 The SRT images at the basic level fall into two categories:specific and totality imagery. An example of a specific is theimage of marionette strings at the knees...designed to allowgreater freedom in the hip socket. An example of a totality isthe image of floating in a pool. Then the whole self merges withthe pool--the outer edges of the self becoming the outer edgesof the pool. At times the specific string image is integratedwithin the pool totality.... In a way, the imagination can be saidto be actively improvising on the images that are given, makingthem relevant to the needs of the student's process at any givenmoment. Joan Skinner, Bridget Davis, Robert Davidson, KrisWheeler, and Sally Metcalf, Skinner Releasing Technique:Imagery and Its Application to Movement Training,Contact Quarterly Vol. 5 no. 1 (Fall 1979).Bonnie, at home in northern California; Nancy, at homein western Massachusetts.Nancy: Self and Other, or SelfOther, is a concept thatyou've been exploring in your recent workshops. Arethey different concepts or the same?Bonnie: I think they're both important; it's not one or theother. I've been interested in community forever--SBMC[The School for Body-Mind Centering] was a vehicle forestablishing community. How does that happen? Self andOther is one way of looking at it. As individuals, we're nota single entity. We're multifaceted.... And as a communitywe're an entity, but within that, we're multifaceted.We start with an egg and a sperm, that's already twovery different consciousnesses. And then at one point we'reeight cells--we could become eight individuals; that'swhen they do in vitro fertilization--so we have withinus the possibility of eight distinct people! And we aredifferent personalities in different situations. Not like asplit personality, where people lose the unity and get lostin the multiplicity. But in different times of our lives or indifferent moments of the day, different personalities comeforth, either to bug us [laughing] and cause distress or tobalance out the others. Instead of seeing this as a problem,we can see this as calling forth another aspect of Self.NSS: The diversity within the Self?BBC: Yeah. So it could be a relationship issue or a workissue or illness or whatever brings out different aspectsof our Self. These different aspects of Self exist and areavailable, and some will be more dominant, some morehidden. How do we balance the matrix of our Self? Howdo we integrate all the aspects of possibility? There's atendency for stronger elements to be more active. Andthen something happens and we have to call forth moreof the hidden. I'm really--internally and also externally--playing with that.When we're in the womb, our birth mother is theenvironment, and at the same time our egg was in ourmother when she was in her mother. So our grandmotherwas the vehicle. She was the one who was our first contactwith the outer world, with whatever culture that was, orsituation--emotional, physical, spiritual.I was reading something interesting, Nancy, thatthe body of the person comes mainly from the egg. Butthe catalyst, the movement, comes from the sperm. I'vedialogued with western science, biology, physiology, andMaybe when we are simply present in the moment, there is noseparation between listening and expression.neurology since I was 16 years old. From them I've learnedabout form and function. Within that context, I'm alwayslooking at process within the form, so I've found otherthings. This process reveals itself through the presenceand movement of consciousness through the body. In away, that's the sperm-ness moving through the egg-ness.The egg is creating form, but it can't create formwithout the motion. Some of us tend to be more motionable,and some of us tend to be more in stillness. That stabilityof form and the mobility of transforming our form varyamong each of us and change within us continually. It'sthat dialogue and interplay between us and within usthat creates SelfOther and Self and Other.Nancy: Do you feel there needs to be a distinction (inBMC practice and/or language around that practice)between science's largely objective lens and a moresubjective way of working that acknowledges outcomesthat are grounded in personal experience? Is there a gaphere to be bridged?Bonnie: Communication occurs in multiple ways.There is the objective approach of observation of othersvia vision and hearing that Western science has primarilylimited itself to. The modern scientific method is oftenonly viewed this way.Then there is the transmission of knowledge throughpersonal experience, in which we can utilize all of oursenses and cellular processes.For example, the ocean can be studied throughdescriptive words, paintings, audio recordings, and videos.Yet until you have personally experienced the ocean, yourunderstanding of it remains only conceptual and/ormetaphorical. It lacks depth of knowing.For me, fully actualized science has the depth of percep-tion based on both the observable and the experienced.The basic question is, can it be transmitted to others, andcan the patterns that emerge be deeply studied and sharedas collective research? Personal experience, foundationalfor astute observation, provides a reality that objectiveinformation alone can only allude to.Cell to Brain, Brain to CellNSS: How are you working in your Self and Otherworkshops to embody the ideas that you're talkingabout? I know that the basis of your work is not justtalking philosophy but embodying things!BBC: First I want to say something about the phenomenonof cell to brain on the same side, and brain to cell on theopposite side.For example, if somebody has a stroke on the rightside of the brain, we know that the left side of the bodyis paralyzed. If they have a stroke on the left side of thebrain, the right side of the body is paralyzed. That is justknown. When the brain is injured, it can no longer processinformation coming in from or going out to the relatedcells on the opposite side of the body.But what I've discovered over the last 10 years has beenthat when the weight of your consciousness, or awareness,is in the cellular experience--for which you have to pauseand wait to perceive a response--the information travelsfirst to the same side of the brain that the cells are on.This traveling along the same side of the body is probablyvascular and fascial rather than neurological. The bloodvessels do not cross the midline in the same way that thenerves do. And the vascular system is an older system. Theheartbeat, as an example, begins at three weeks embryolog-ically; the brainwaves begin in the fetus at about sixmonths. The circulatory system is an older one thanthe nerves, and the nerves rest on the foundation ofthe vascular pathways.NSS: Is the cellular level a slower process?BBC: It is slower in that the cells are reorganizing. Bypausing and holding the space for the cells to absorb theircurrent state, they begin to recognize their present inter-relationships and begin to return to the primal relationshipsdeveloped in the embryo that created our original form,before other patterns set in. The cells are then releasedfrom the outer, more static or fixed control of the brain.An example: If someone has an injury on the rightside of the brain and has paralysis in the left leg and arm,it's effective to start working cellularly with the right leg,which is, quote, okay. This allows the cellular informationon the right side of the body to travel to the right side ofthe brain, which is injured. Then work cellularly with theleft leg, which is affected, to send information to the leftside of the brain, which is okay. We then repeat the sameprocess with the arms. The results can be extraordinary.The brain cells are nourished by reexperiencing the primalfoundation, established in the embryo, of communicationbetween cells on the same side of the body.When we say focus on this subject, we're engagingthe pathway from the brain to the cells. Then we have topause in order for the cells to communicate more informa-tion back to the brain. So what I found with this cell tobrain on the same side is that by working cellularly on thesame side of the body as the brain injury, more informationcomes into the injured side of the brain. Therefore, it hasmore information from which to then control the opposite,or affected, side of the body. I'm giving the example of astroke because that's the most common and clearest tounderstand, but it would be true for anything. If you workwith the right leg cellularly, it will go to the right side ofthe brain; if you work with the left leg cellularly, it will goto the left side of the brain. Then as the brain has moreinformation, it automatically utilizes that information incontrolling the opposite side of the body.It's very interesting because it actually works. Not withevery person, because not everything works for every person.Both of these things are happening all the time--cell to brain, brain to cell, cell to brain.... We need bothconnections.What I will often say is, Open the back of your brain.The information comes in through the back of the centralnervous system--the back of the spinal cord and brain--and the motor pathways come out through the front. Weare just built that way.Bonnie and Dodge exploring the separateness of Self andOther and the unity of SelfOther.Deep Listening and ExpressionBBC: How this might relate to Self and Other... You andI are sharing now, right? We're talking, and I can say,Well, Nancy, what do you think about this? But if I keepthinking Nancy, what do you think about this? I'm notgoing to really take in what you're saying. But if I open theback of me and just be receptive, in deep listening, thenthere's a pause, and then from that deep listening I comeforward with my expression and understanding, and yougo into the back of your body (spinal cord and brain) intodeep listening.NSS: What do you think about the alternation of those? Ifeel like in dancing and improvising and Contact Improvi-sation--and I would think also in bodywork--it's always acombination. You're listening, you feel a signal of where tomove or what to say or do, and then you do it, and then youpause again. Right? Would you say they alternate, or arethey always happening at the same time?BBC: I think it's probably alternating, slowly or at greatspeed. And sometimes you jump circuit. I could say weinterrupt the cycle. For some people it's an interruption,and for some other people it's just a faster connection. Insome cultures, you're on top of each other in a very fastrhythm, and in others, there's a lot of lonnnng phrasingand in others, short phrasing--the difficulty happenswhen one is a short phraser and the other's a long phraser,or one is slow and the other is quick. Maybe when weare simply present in the moment, there is no separationbetween listening and expression.For example, in Contact Improvisation, if you arenot receiving information cellularly into the back of yourspinal cord and brain and are instead trying to figure outhow to respond to a situation from the front of your brain,you can get hurt, because you're inhibiting the reflexiveknowing from the present cellular experience. Incominginformation comes in through the back, outgoing motorresponses go out through the front. In any current situa-tion, to the degree that we are not open to the incominginformation and are responding only through the frontof our brain, we are engaged in habitual behavior, whichresides in the front. Reflexive motor response is based onyour cellular knowing in the present moment rather thanon preconceived ideas, principles, and habits of experiencethat are now stored in the front of your brain.NSS: What I've enjoyed over the years about ContactImprovisation is that it's a kind of conversation whereyou're able to talk and listen at the same time--or veryrapidly alternating--and the rhythms created by thevarying lengths of either one of those, in terms of priorities,vary. Obviously, if there's a dangerous moment, the actionmight take quick priority; or conversely, in an openmoment, where you don't have a strong impulse to DOanything, there might be more listening. I love the ideaof being in that pause, that open moment, together.Differentiating Self and OtherBBC: With SelfOther, we need to also differentiate Self andOther. The distinction between the two is very important.There's a cycling within and between us that's becomingone. Thoughts, feelings, whatever is moving between us--we are becoming a unit of SelfOther. At the same time,you are Other to me and I am Other to you. I'm not Nancy,and you're not Bonnie. For instance, you mentioned earlierthat years ago when you were in a workshop with me onTransitional Fluid, I had said something that was mean-ingful to you, but it was your experience that you shared,not mine.NSS: Yeah, it's wonderful that you always point that out,because it's very common for people to say, You said thisand I learned that from you. But you are provoking mylearning for myself.BBC: Exactly. Or people will say your work. I would say itbecomes our work.NSS: Well, it does ultimately. But this pointing to experience,this kind of provocation that you're creating, is the environ-ment, the condition, in which I have my experience. Creatingthat condition is an essential and important factor in theevolution of our consciousness. People in your workshopsaren't just wandering around the room without any direc-tion. I mean, your presence gives a lot of direction, but that'snot always quite enough. You give more orientation thanthat. I feel like the condition that you set up--and that weall set up in our teaching and structuring of improvisationsand our relationship to our communities--is veryinfluential and crucial in what happens among people.I want to honor the function of creating conditionsfor experience. This creating of conditions in which peoplecan learn and discover on their own, within a communitywith a positive, accepting, benevolent intention, is a veryspecial and hard-to-describe art form...or skill. It's hardto pin it down, but you can feel it when it's there.BBC: I think we're planting seeds and blowing them intothe wind. But you can't grow the seed--the seed has togrow itself. And then you end up with a forest. You mayhave started with one tree giving seeds and then thoseseeds grow trees that grow seeds. And the tree that issetting these seeds received a seed from others. The Selfand the Other each is an entity and together becomesSelfOther. Yet within SelfOther, there's a Self and an Other.Unless you've had a practice of some kind that allows Selfand Other to become SelfOther, it separates more andmore into Self and Other.One of the things I've done quite a bit over the lastyears in workshops is that I'll ask people to stand one byone and say their name. As an example, I'll say Bonnieand sit down. To stand, to speak your name, and to hearyour name before you sit down. So you really establishyour space in the room, and everyone really establishestheir space in the room before we do anything together.Many people hate that. Because to stand out, to reallyclaim your space, is often difficult. A lot of people maybecome late because they don't want to do it--as a first thing,before people know each other. We're standing in front ofstrangers. But by the end, there's a way that the space, themind of the room, has formed a community. It's the clarityof I'm here. Each one: I'm here and I recognize that youare here and that we are all here together.NSS: I'm wondering if you give time in your workshops foran open space with little instruction, an open nonverbalmoment for moving or being still, to just process the day'sinformation and experience, integrating the Self and theOther within the day's work.BBC: In my classes, there are no two people who do thesame thing. There are times when I'll just say, OK, this isyour playground; whatever you want to do. Especially nowwhen I'm having such large workshops, I might have twoor three rooms where people can choose a different space.The spaces have their own feeling, their own quality. Somepeople will be dancing; some just lying down; some doinghands-on, giving and receiving individual attention; sometalking, looking at anatomical models, handouts.In the beginning, there's a very strong form, but throughmost of the rest, there's very little form. The theme mightbe comparing and exploring the pubic disc versus thesacrum as the keystone of the arch between the two legsand noticing how the sacrum, as the keystone, locks thespine, and the pubic disc frees the spine. Do it and seehow you feel.NSS: What's interesting to me is that in your work and inthe work you have generated with others, there is a rangefrom very specific anatomical instruction, like what youjust described, to a very wide open place of exploration.Or vice versa. I think that's remarkable and wonderful.BBC: In discussions after an exploration, people will say,I don't know what to say--because it's preverbal. That'sone of our challenges in the field of somatics--how do wecreate verbal and written language. You and Lisa, throughCQ, have been at the forefront of that. How does experiencecome back to words? How do we create a vocabulary ofpreverbal experience that then goes back to the experience?So that the verbal isn't what is being transmitted but rathertransmits back to original experience. It's another seed.BBC: OK. I mentioned earlier the egg and the sperm, theembryology, and I'd like to add something. In the womb,the baby and the mother are one--SelfOther. And thengradually we become separate from the mother, but we'restill identified within the family, within the culture, withinthe era or country. We may or may not be comfortablewith any of these, but we're inescapably influenced bythem. This is our original field in which we experienceand develop our early sense of Self, Other, SelfOther, andSelf and Other. How do I experience and perceive my Self,your Self, ourSelf? How can we gradually grow the accep-tance, discernment, and trust to become comfortable,joyful, and grateful for the multiplicity and diversity ofthe expanding unit?painting by Bonnie Bainbridge CohenAnimals also experience the separateness and the unity ofSelf and Other.Illuminate Theater members Taiwo Ojodun [far background] (Lagos,Nigeria), Olowu Busayo (Lagos), and Jakob Maché (W.

It's happened atother times in history, but with the Internet we have thepossibility of a unity even if we don't want it. How do we notlose our independent sense of Self, and how do we embracenow the SelfOther with the world itself--including natureand the environment?We're being challenged today at such an enormousscale. There are those who are intensifying the Self ANDOther, and there are those who are advocating for moreSelfOther. And it depends on each of us. How do we helpto build, within a dance, a movement class, or what we'redoing, the recognition of SelfOther within the context ofSelf and Other--the possibility of it through the experienceof it. To point to it isn't enough. There has to be the space,the space for the experience. And then to bring it back intowords so we can think about it, discuss it, and share it, andthen go BACK into the experience. Not to lose our Self andthe recognition of other Selves but to embrace both fully.After we turned the recording off, Bonnie said, Let's breathein and out together. And I said, Can we do it now before wehang up? And she said, I would love to. And we did",
