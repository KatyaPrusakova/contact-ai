    "Content": "EDITOR NOTE\n\nYou have just come within a hair’s\nbreadth of holding a magazine named\nContact Q in your hands. Though it\nhad its advantages (keeping the familiar\n“Contact” and the useful “CQ” in play),\n\"Contact Q” failed to inspire, to imply\na future to grow into, a vision of not\nonly where we’ve come from but where\nwe are and are going to.\nTo be honest, if the word ‘Quarterly’\nweren’t so inflexible in its interpretation,\nso clearly inaccurate, and causing\nus to receive daily calls and letters from\nconfused subscribers thinking they’re\nmissing an issue or two, we probably\nwouldn’t be looking for a new name\njust now. But it is, and we are.\nHowever, pressed to do something,\nwe took a deep breath, and did nothing.\nThis was, in my opinion, a good thing\nto do. Sometimes the only way to see\nwhich way something is moving is to\nkeep still.\nAnd so, for the moment, we remain\nContact Quarterly, a biannual journal of\ncontemporary dance, improvisation, and\nmovement arts, a vehicle for moving\nideas that has long since grown past its\ninitial production schedule and focus of\nsharing news among Contact Improvisors\nworldwide.\nWe have changed a name, however.\nAs of this issue, the CQ Newsletter has\nbecome the Cl Newsletter. By making\nour relationship to Contact Improvisation\nevident—in the Newsletter, “Contacts”\nlisting, and “Still Moving” column—and\nnot merely assumed, we can\nmore clearly frame the space which\nexists in the body of the journal for\nwhatever is on our readers’ minds,\nwhich is plenty—a multitude of movement\npractices, performance forms,\ntechniques and experiences with bodywork,\nmovement training, reeducation,\nand dancemaking in the Americas, Europe,\nand finally beginning to extend\nbeyond, as we reach for the like-minded\nin other cultures.\nThroughout the summer, determined\nto have a new name by this issue, we\nengaged all willing subjects in the\nsearch. Though we played with a range\nof ideas, we continued to feel it might\nbe important to keep Contact in the\nname—not only to connect our future\nwith our past, and to indicate our ongoing\ncommitment to the Contact work,\nbut to reinforce the currency of the\nword itself: contact, touch, the meeting\nof minds, people, bodies of work. We\nare always aiming for this.\nWe like the “Q” too. Some names\nconsidered: Contact, Contact Q, The Q,\nContact Journal, Contact Papers, Contact\nBiannual, Contact 2, CQ, C2, C?.\nBut maybe it all has to go, a snake\nshedding its skin. “Second Skin,” not a\nbad name.\nCould the name be something that\nidentifies but does not define? Something\nthat lets the thing speak for itself,\nlike you and I do? What, after all, is a\n“Fred” or a “Sally”? Only what they put\ninto it, I suppose. A rose is a rose, etc.\nI remember not long ago Deborah\nHay was looking for a name for a new\ndance and didn’t want it to be a word.\nShe finally arrived at a little drawing, a\nlogo, a symbol that could represent the\npiece in the place of a word on the\npage. I still wonder how she refers to\nthe piece in conversation.\nFor that matter, the name could be a\nmovement itself. We could call it\n[wave] or [twist] or [squat] and do the\nmovement whenever mentioning the\nmag. A kind of permanent charade.\n“Charade,” that’s a nice name.\nIt was a relief not to force a choice\nwhen the right option hadn’t yet been\nfound. I look forward to that special\nbody hum that signals the right choice—\nthe organism primitively indicating\n‘yes’, opening, going toward. Not “yes,\nbecause...,” with a list of good reasons\nto support it. Just yes.\nIndeed, the search for a new name\nhas all the fun of a crossword puzzle\nand the angst of a midlife crisis, the\nexcitement of making a piece of art and\nthe responsibility of getting the grant in\nthe mail before the post office closes.\nOur timing seems to be somewhere\nbetween body time and the clock,\nbetween geological time and the fax,\nbetween now and the speed of a good\nidea. Please don’t hesitate to send in\nyours.",

    "Content": "Only the years separate me, a participant in the events of these two\nbooks, and me, the ‘objective’ reviewer. I read them, then, with double vision.\nAt first glance they were histories of two strands of improvisational thought:\none strand was formal (Novack’s); the other anarchic (Ramsay’s).\nSecond glances reveal they are academic theses dressed up for publication.\nArtifacts of the times (interviews, reviews) were sifted to create the authors’\nthemes; very like retro-entrail. The findings were then sorted to create patterns\nand cemented into place. This cementing creates mosaics from what was once\ninflux. Both Novack and Ramsay have made excellent patterns appear in their\nbooks, and they gave me much to think about—the translation of one medium\ninto another, and life into print. Life was more complete and fluid than history\nis. But the historians have the responsibility for the last cementing of the\nartifacts.\nTHE GRAND UNION (1970-1976): An Improvisational Performance\nGroup. Margaret Hupp Ramsay. Peter Lang Publishing Inc.: NY, 1991,\n195pp., illustrated.\nGrand Union was an improvisational dance/theatre group which evolved out\nof a work called Continuous Project Altered Daily, by Yvonne Rainer, the\nAmerican choreographer turned film director.\nOriginally nine choreographers and performers, it was an attempt at a\nleaderless, democratic, spontaneously creative ensemble. As such it succeeded\nand then failed. The initially stimulating freedoms became ambiguities after a\nfew years, and by the end in 1976 had fallen to suspicion, doubt, innuendos.\nFreedom attended by hope was a creative stimulus. Conversely, lack of\nguidance attended by doubt was remarkably inhibiting.\nDr. Margaret Hupp Ramsay’s book consists of scholarly, detailed, well-\ndocumented oral history. Every quoted remark is noted at the chapter end.\nPhotographs of Grand Union appear at the end, and are disappointing.\nBut the text is not Ramsay’s weaving of the diverse strands into a smoothly\nreadable, cohesive story of five tumultuous years is very tight. She begins with\nthe necessary explanations and then the reader is, seamlessly, in the thick of it\nRamsay recounts the internal descent of Grand Union into neurotic\nexistential turmoil. The evidence is in the rich layers of material, especially one\nremark by dance historian Sally Banes who describes a dizzying “reality warp”:\n“The roles, characters and persona transformed easily to accommodate\nthe changing flow of situations... For instance, a ‘real’ Dilley interacting\nwith a fabricated’ Gordon, or a Lewis who has been instructed by\nBrown to imitate Paxton... [They were] people who seemed to operate\noutside any established rules for reality—ordinary, dramatic, or\nfictional.”\nUnfortunately Ramsay does not extend her scope to compare such problems to\nthose encountered by performers of set material. This would have been\ninstructive. On evidence presented we may assume the problem arose from\nimprovisational freedom. Performing itself is an altered state, continued daily;\nRamsay comes very close to a central issue, but her distant, academic tone\nprevents analysis. She cannot speculate in this setting.\nShe concludes: “[It is up to the] next generation to make sense out of one\nof the richest, most courageous and least self-conscious creative periods in\ndance history, a period that profoundly changed the direction of dance\nperformance.”\nShorn of hyperbole, she has shifted responsibility to the next generation but\nthe next generation has already gone by, making their own unexplained\nchoreographic works. Have we the luxury of time? Ramsay is a dance\nimprovisor, so we may assume she has experienced the personal differences\nbetween choreography and improvisation. I feel that the allusions come across\nin her text as personal squabbles. They are in fact issues which bear upon the\neveryday and political realities, especially recent changes: what problems arise\nwhen social forms and norms are absent? What difficulties does freedom bring?\nFreedom is not always possible and when it occurs we must seize the moment.\nGrand Union had five years: the freedom was not always easy, and Ramsay was\nthe next generation. She has left the difficulties where she found them. I fear\nthat generations succeeding hers will trip upon them.\nRamsay here nicely establishes her academic credentials. We still require\nanswers: is improvisation a retrograde or higher evolution in dance? Is it a\nmental aspect of flying beyond technical security which is posed as a final goal\nof technical study? Is it a place where Dionysius reigns? Or do Apollo and\nDionysius meet? Or does Dionysius wear Apollo’s mask?\n\nIn the early 1960s, I was a student. Modern dance was dropping its antiballet\nchauvinism, and in the process began to dilute some of the more\ndistinctive styles which had developed. Dance in general strove for ever higher\ntechnical levels, achieved them and moved on up. With lip service to the\nfounding principles of modern dance still available, and against the ascending\naridity of technical amalgamation, I spent about ten years exploring the\npossibilities of the ordinary movement we all start moving with. Others poked\neven deeper into the mysteries, examining infant development, the effect of\nimages in originating movement; in general, a reevaluation of the mind-body\nsituation. Improvisation is, of course, the mind-body situation in a nutshell and\nwas absent, except for Anna Halprin, from the modern dance practices then\npopular. Times were ripe for an examination of it.\nSHARING THE DANCE: Contact Improvisation and American\nCulture. Cynthia J. Novack. New Directions in Anthropological Writing.\nMadison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1990. xvii + 258 pp.,\nphotographs, references, index.\nCynthia J. Novack has constructed a prismatic view of the movement form\ncontact improvisation, which began in 1972 and grew into a loosely structured\nnetwork around the world. A dancer working toward her degree in anthropology,\nNovack participated in contact improvisation classes and jams, gathered\ninterviews and viewed the relevant videotapes.\nSince the early ’70s, video has evolved into a standard recording device.\nThis must make anthropologists happy. Novack’s generation has for study a\nvisual perspective previously unavailable to those who wished to examine the\ndevelopment of a particular technique or movement aesthetic. She begins her\nbook with a description of a moment in a duet. I imagine she was writing in\nfront of a video monitor:\n“The supporting figure shifts slightly, and his partner tumbles\nsmoothly to the floor; the two, enmeshed but not entangled, roll and\nslide over each other now, exchanging support like two friendly wrestlers\nwhose desire is to keep moving rather than to pin the opponent. Now\nthey are standing, leaning against each other, still not looking into the\nother’s face; with a sudden leap, the smaller man launches himself into\nthe air. His partner steps quickly underneath him to break his fall,\nbecoming a kind of moving post around which he spirals in his descent.\"\nI imagine she watches it again on the screen, perhaps using slow motion to\nexamine details...\nNovack’s anthropological approach makes this book remarkably unlike dance\nhistories and personality-driven memoirs to which we are accustomed. There\nis an academic and particular, slightly staccato quality to her text. She has\nchosen words precisely to reveal the times (1960s and ’70s, in the U.S.A.) from\nmany perspectives, with special attention to the larger social and political\ndevelopments of the ’60s; the upheavals and uproars, and the attitudes behind\nthem; and then she looks for their imprint in the aesthetics and practice of the\nnew improvisation form. She also draws parallels and contrasts with social\ndancing, the ballet, modern dance, Merce Cunningham, Anna Halprin, Erick\nHawkins, the experimental dance and theater of the 1960s, and more: martial\narts, Zen Buddhism, touch, physical law and nature, and improvisation generally.\nThe many photographs instruct and amuse equally because with so many\nreferences we never know who is going to appear next, nor even why they have\nbeen invited. The captions reveal that they aren’t there because they look great\nor because we love them, but to make another point in the prismatic view. Thus\nwe can look through Carla Fracci and Erik Bruhn to the tradition of facial\nexpressions in ballet; or we can see through the physical geometries of Pilobolus\nDance Theatre how their use of shapes of the body elaborate into effects in\nspace around the body.\nWe also see a number of performing groups who do not express visual\npatterns in this way. We see that these performers are not necessarily on their\nfeet, and that people are touching each other for personal or physical reasons\nrather than stylistic ones, and the performers seem not to care so much how they\nlook but are focused upon what they are doing.\nAt any rate, this is the nature of Novack’s prism. Each facet is drawn\nclearly enough so we can look through it to the other side, where some other\ndance is happening, some influential social development is occurring. However\ndisparate these facets may be, anthropologically they are married in time.\nNovack’s viewpoint is so singular that the small cracks which I spy in her\nstructure are endearing—I accept the cracks in order to enjoy her concept of how\nsuch a structure might work, what it can show us about how culture is\nconstructed.\nIdeally, Novack’s book would be expanded to really dig into the century of\nmodem dance, which has achieved remarkable formal diversity. The anthropological\ndistance and the wealth of information she can concentrate for the reader\nmakes her approach an interesting candidate to explore how a notion like\nmodem dance could come into being. The variety of influences mentioned in\nher text precludes tracing each genealogy, but suggests that each could be traced\nusing this first study as an opening to understand how many levels of culture\nfrom high, to vernacular, to foreign, may operate within a ‘single’ current\nmovement construct.\nHowever, Novack’s deliberate discipline is to limit the time scan and then\nconnect what she finds growing within it. She finds a form of improvisation\nwhich many people felt “literally embodied the social ideologies of the early\n’70s which rejected traditional gender roles and social hierarchies.”\nFor me, the emphasis of the book relies on the point of view in this\nstatement. Contact improvisaiton is seen not so much in terms of its place in\na dance lineage, but primarily through the eyes of a counter-culture which\nexisted to protest a peculiar unjust war in Vietnam, and to promote racial\nequality.\nThe emphasis of Sharing the Dance might have been how artistic subcultures\ninfluenced the counter-culture of the ’60s (witness the extraordinary\ninfiltration of the idea of ‘Pop Art’.) Or perhaps we must admit that it is a two-\nway street, to come back to Novack’s thesis with an understanding that we are\ndealing with matters of echo and resonances between groups of us which\nreinforce a focus into a ‘topic’. On this topic, though my ‘reality’ and Novack’s\nconstruct don’t jibe precisely, I completely enjoyed pondering whether the times\nproduce the events or the events define the times. Or...\nNovack’s valuable reference index runs to eleven pages of books, articles,\nfilms and videotapes.",

    "Content": "To Be Continued was performed at Danspace, St. Mark’s Church in New York City in\nApril 1991, by Simone Forti & Troupe which then included KJ. Holmes, Lauri Nagel,\nEric Schoefer, and David Zambrano. We had been working together for five years,\nthough Eric had joined the group in 1989 after David Rosenmiller left. Jon Gibson\ncreated the music for this piece on a series of tapes to be played and overlapped over\nvarious loudspeakers as we saw fit. Andrew Gaines played the tapes for the\nperformance. We worked on the piece for a month.\nWe had been using a dance/narrative form I’ve been developing that I call “moving\nthe telling.” In this process we focus on chosen subject matter—a person, a memory,\na landscape, a news story, the wrinkles on a shirt, etc.—as our point of reference and\nallow the spontaneous impulses for movement and for speaking to manifest so that\nthey supplement each other intuitively and naturally. This has its roots in how we\ncommunicate all the time.\nLet me give an example. I once watched a video program in which Joseph\nCampbell (in the context of a discussion about consciousness) described the\nmovements of a climbing vine in his garden in Hawaii. As he spoke, he started out\nwith a simple gesture describing his terrace. By the end of his story he had shifted\nforward on his chair, extended himself to full sitting height and, spiraling slightly to\nthe left, uncurled his held-together fingers, his face in an upward and diagonal\npresentation to the sun. To tell us what he meant, he had embodied the climbing vine.\nThe following are notes about the process of creating the piece.\n\nWorking from objects, making drawings as a bridge to embodying. The eye moves,\nthe hand moves. The body embodies, the hand moves and the body’s embodiment\nshows in the drawn line. And then the body can continue on its own, embodying a\ndetail while the speaking gives the large shape or the context, or the other way around.\n\nIt’s representational. It represents an awareness of an object, through how that\nawareness moves the body, how the body speaks of knowing the object, of the object\nOf impressions. It’s impressionistic.\n\nI once ate some bad shellfish and landed in a hospital. One day I stood at the window\ndaydreaming. A small scene that happened in the grounds below made an impression.\nOn a path, a convalescent in pajamas looked at a tree. And as he looked he shifted his\nweight and twisted and stretched just a little. He embodied the tree, for a moment,\nand shuffled on.\n\nI went to see the Fauve* show at the Met. Then I brought the Troupe. Then Jon. I\nliked the freedom of the paint, how what its colors were and how its material was set\ndown on canvas was in response to something outside the one who was putting on the\npaint, giving the impression of that thing, in a way that harked deeply of that aspect of\nthat thing that was being experienced.\n*Fauve was an outgrowth of impressionism, but wilder. Andrd Derain and Henri\nMatisse were part of this group.\n\nFor us, the drawing of the objects was a bridge, and as we came to be intimate with\nthe drawing, it worked as an analogy. If we could draw what we saw, we could “body\nmove” what we saw, with all the kinetic stimulation that can come from the\ndeveloping page now coming from our movement in itself and in its relationship to its\nsource: a tom box, a balcony of repeating arches, a comer where steam pipes\ndisappear into the wall.\n\nThe speaking is more like the line. It’s black and white. Whereas the movement is\nthe paint. Roughly. We spoke of the music as the frame. Jon liked the idea. And\nmade the music to be the frame. It consisted of his saxophone playing recorded\nduring our rehearsals together, and some nature sounds.\n\nI went to see Robert Rauschenberg’s big lithographs from the ’60s at the Whitney\nMuseum. Photographic images floated in space in different orientations. A propeller\nplane in the upper left, a tilted Rubens nude towards center, an upside down image of\nworkers in a foundry, and throughout, kinetic laying on of line and paint. I had been\nlooking for ways to include plenty of “free” dancing in our piece. And it occurred to\nme to include the possibility that anyone could go “dancing-through” anybody’s\nportraits or still lifes, anytime they wanted.\n\nThe process of making the piece was very close to workshop. Maybe because the\ntechnique is elusive. One day you can do it, it’s rolling out naturally. Next time you\ncan’t get the hang of it. It’s the technique of tapping into a certain kind of awareness,\nand a certain kind of behavior which does have natural roots, like Joseph Campbell\nweaving his body language into his speaking, but which we’re not used to being\nconscious of, or developing. Certain exercises can tap it. And different ones of us\nresponded more to one exercise or another.\n\nContact Improvisation is very important to Eric and to KJ. and one day I suggested\nthey try a duet with story telling. Actually, with a conversational mode. They chose\nthe subject of relationships. Their conversation was pretty banal (which brings up an\ninteresting question of how to stay poetically vital) but something very interesting\nhappened with their movement They started their duet and just focused on the\nmovement til they were well into it before beginning to speak. They weren’t going to\ntry to have their conversation effect their movement. It did, but in subtle ways: the\ngestures that can’t be helped, the spurt of energy on being reminded of something you\nwant to tell about, the story’s bravado that catches the movement on fire.\n\nThere was an exercise which was important to us as an ice breaker: words on the\ndiagonal. It’s a short solo form, a kind of game. Someone calls a word out and\nwhoever’s turn it is starts out on a pathway across the space, moving and talking,\nusing the word as an impetus. Somehow the pressure is minimal. There’s no decision\nabout going; it’s your turn so you go. The sudden word calls up images, you can\nalmost see the player bounce the word around in his or her body, getting a feel of the\nideas that rush in, and getting started on one of those ideas. We kept words on the\ndiagonal as an exercise but dropped it from the piece.\n\nAt a certain point I started wondering how we were going to get from the exercises to\nthe piece. And then the piece started to emerge as an orchestration of our two basic\nexercises: still lifes, which also involved drawings, and portraits. And dancing-through\nbecame the counterpoint which wove it all together. The structure became set. We\nknew who would start, at what point objects to draw would be brought in or removed,\nin what order the portraits would come.\nThere were some other elements: a contact improvisation duet for K.J. and Eric\nwhile they talked about their families, K.J. singing with one of the saxophone\nrecordings, and Simone and Lauri echoing environmental sounds. And slides of our\ndrawings. But the sections were always a new rendering of our materials. We were\nimprovising.\n\nThe still lifes render the present. The portraits depend on memories, and render the\npast. But the memories have to come by surprise. The portrait process is more\ncomplex, more mysterious. Memories come that are of events, stories, details of the\nsubject’s environment, their way of moving or thinking. What is embodied? Where\ndoes the movement come from? Mostly it’s specific memories, like a prevailing mood\nor a patch of light on the wall, that get animated. At moments, the subject of the\nportrait is embodied directly.\n\nTranscript of Lauri’s “move-tell” portrait:\n“He doesn’t stop moving. He moves like there’s something inside him moving.\nAnd he says, 7 have to tell you something’. And then when there’s no place left to go\nhe still has to keep moving so he starts to put things in places, his shoe where the\ncereal goes, a piece of candy in his slipper, pencil in the garbage can. He really\nwants to stop. He takes off his clothes then he puts them back on, four shirts, then he\ntakes them off and he puts on two belts. 7 have to tell you something’. They always\nseem to have bingo in the hospitals and in this hospital there was the kind with the\nround wooden balls instead of the chips. And the balls are all in a cage and they all\nsay different numbers on them. And he likes to crank the wheel on the cage and they\nmake a loud noise and all the balls rattle around inside and then one ball falls out and\nhe reads cause he can still read and he says, ‘M 29’. Yesterday when I was at the\nhospital I saw this thing on the chair. It was a jacket and it had a zipper, it had these\nlong straps. He said, 7 have to tell you something’. He said it wasn’t chains. It\nwasn’t trains or planes or chains. I said, ‘Was it straps?’ It was straps.’’\n\nOften a still life and a portrait or, say, two still lifes might happen simultaneously,\nplaced in different parts of the performance space. This practice came out of an\nexercise called simultaneous stories, which develops the skill of staying in focus while\nnot obliterating the other nearby story. It takes listening to the general sound of the\nother, and sensitively building a rhythm with silences and room for separating and\nblending the stories. Amazing coincidences emerge, no doubt helped by the peripheral\nhearing of a word from the other story which makes yours take an unexpected jump of\nfocus.\nOften we worked together with one performer initiating, say, a portrait, and one or\nmore others in a supportive role, in a mode we developed through an exercise we\ncalled taking the “uh huh” position. It’s an exercise in listening, nodding as comes\nnaturally in conversation, maybe asking for more information or clarification, and also\ntaking action to embody aspects of the emerging story, diving in on an impulse to\nbecome the easy chair the story teller can sink into while remembering an uncle.\n\nOur warmups were an important part of our rehearsals so that when we would start to\nspeak we would be well into a movement mode in our blood and in our mind. It\nbecame clear that I should lead the warmups so that we would come to the speaking\nout of a shared physical experience.",

    "Content": "A friend and I were travelling around the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. One\nday, we met a man who described a grotto, a cave that held within it several pools of\nwater. The grotto was deep in the jungle about fifty km. south of where we were\nstaying. He told us of a local farmer who guides visitors into the cave. All of the\ninformation was very vague but, early one morning, we prepared for the adventure.\nFirst we covered ourselves up from head to toe with long pants, long-sleeved shirts,\nhiking boots, neck scan/es, rain wear, hats, cotton gloves and sun screen. We\nbrought along a compass, a flashlight, extra water, a snakebite kit, antihistamines, and\nlip balm. This was the tropics and we were going into the jungle; a team of explorers,\nprotected from bites, scratches, poisons, too much heat, too much sun, getting lost or\nthirsty. Intent on beating the heat of the day, we bundled into the car early in the\nmorning and took off.\nFortunately, there aren’t a whole lot of roads in the Yucatan so we didn't have too\nmany choices. Eventually, after frequent stops for advice, we came to what we\nthought was the likely area. There were two title children playing in a field. We asked\nthem where we might find a guide to lead us to the caves. They went for their father\nwho was working in a nearby field and brought him back to us. He told us he was too\nbusy preparing for planting, but that the children could take us. We must have looked\ndismayed because before he turned and went back to work he assured us that they\nwere quite capable. The girl was six and her little brother, four. They were barefoot,\nshe wearing a little cotton dress and he, shorts. She always had his little hand in\nhers. Feeling uneasy, but not wanting to be insulting, we followed the children across\na yard littered with tires, cars and other msted debris and then into the dense foliage\nthat circled their small household. We followed an overgrown, narrow path, the\nchildren skipping along ahead of us, talking, singing, laughing.\nAfter awhile, we descended a steep hill that dropped us right to the portal of the\ncave. It was a small opening amidst thickly growing vines. Without the children, we\nnever would have noticed it. They led us through the passageway into a dark, dank,\nwinding tunnel that descended deeper and deeper into the earth. Occasionally, the\nchildren instructed us to crawl on our bellies to avoid the bats hanging overhead, and,\neven then, we sometimes felt them brushing along our backs. A bit further on,\nfollowing some casual hand signals of the little girl, we skirted around Pipo, an\nenormous tarantula, guarding his little comer of darkness. The children were quite\nfamiliar with his idiosyncracies and even seemed happy to see him. Eventually we\ncame to the black pools we’d been searching for. Two silent pools rested, bottomless,\nclear, side by side in a large and dimly lit chamber.\nOur guides, the little girl and boy, felt as comfortable there as we would feel in our\nliving rooms. They were stalkers, their eyes and ears alerted to any signs of danger,\nof newness, change. Their awareness protected them. The jungle, which was so\nominous to us, seemed to extend, harmoniously, from their very beings.\nTo improvise is to stalk. We stalk the objects of awareness, the phenomenon of the\nlimitlessness of sensation, memory and imagination. We deconstruct this phenomenon into\ndetails and, through them, witness our continual experience. These experiences are, at times,\nperilous, and at other times enlightening. Whatever they are, we meet them openhandedly.\nSometimes, this means we crawl on our bellies, slide pressed along a wall, even momentarily\ndisappear. We walk softly, crash into, or fly, whatever works, whatever helps us greet ourselves.\nFor now, from the limitlessness of possibilities, we’ll extract and explore only four.\n\nFOUR STATES: an exercise\nEveryone, distance yourself from one another and stand with your arms relaxed by\nyour sides. I'll describe four forms or activities to you. For the next ten minutes or so\nimprovise by switching back and forth between them. Spend as long as you like in\neach one. Don't msh through. Be sure to keep the forms distinct from one another.\nIn other words, don't blend or merge their aspects. Shift clearly from one to another.\nIn the first form involve yourself only with breath. No movement. Remain still in\nwhatever posture you're in. Play with your breath, the ordering, rhythm, depth, and\nforce. No voice, just breath.\nThe second form is very slow and continuous movement in silence. No sounds,\nstops, starts or pauses. Ever moving slow motion.\nThe third is large, loud and travelling sound and movement. Keep the sound and\nmovement linked and always travel through the room with it\nThe final form is non-stop talking. Stop moving for this one, be completely still and\nput all your attention into your talking. Let one idea lead you to the next, free associate,\nlose control.\nSometime in the next few minutes associate with someone near you. Form a\npartnership and continue improvising within these four forms. Now you’re in direct\nrelation to one another; you’re in the same world. Every move, every shift is a\nresponse to your partner and is either in the same form or one that’s different.\nThese four forms were chosen for their contrasting qualities. Others could also work too,\nsince it’s contrasting quality that’s pertinent to the exercise. Why would one want to shift from\nvery slow movement to loud, boisterous sound and movement? What inspires someone to shift\nfrom a non-verbal orientation to language?\nThe mind is a limb of the body. Like an arm, for instance. If the arm doesn’t move for an\nextended period of time, it atrophies, withers, loses its ability to move, forgets. Then it has to be\ncoaxed back, reminded, exercised, and encouraged to recover.\nWe're forcing an issue here. A student is asked to shift from one arbitrarily chosen condition\n(slow motion) to another (loud, traveling, sound and movement). The shift reflects an internal\nlogic. In other words, it must make sense to them. The process must be a living experience.\nOnce the intention to shift is there, the mind can expand to accommodate and rationalize any\ncontrasting realities, no matter how quickly they arise and how unreasonable they appear. The\nimagination doesn’t attach itself to anything. It doesn’t want to stay put or not stay put.\nNow we crawl on our bellies, avoiding the bats. Now pay homage to the tarantula. Now we\ndive into the luxury of the pool. If we can adapt to external changes, we can adapt to internal\nones. Stalking change, adapting adapting itself.\nAll of this inner stalking, tripping off into the imagination, can distract us from the world around\nus. The latter part of the exercise takes the student into a partnering relationship, and insists that\nthey come out of themselves enough to notice the other, empathize with the other and share\nreality-making.\nThe partners communicate using these four forms. Contrast brings liveliness and breadth to\ntheir communication. Limited to four choices, participants engage with the forms differently each\ntime they return to them. Slow movement might mean something different the second time\naround, or the fourth, or fifth. The possibilities for any given form range. Slow movement, or any\nform, can be the voice of just about anything.",

    "Content": "Central Java, Indonesia\n\nSUPRAPTO SURYODARMO (Prapto)\nis a Javanese performer and movement\nmaster who lives and teaches mostly in his\nhometown of Solo in Central Java, Indonesia.\nHe has a special way of teaching how\nto unify body energies with mental awareness\nthrough the medium of movement and\nmeditation. Prapto has developed his\nteaching program over the last ten years\nparticularly for Western artists, movement\nteachers and performers. He holds a regular\ncourse program on a specially designed\npiece pf land which he created as a kind of\nnature temple in order to support the student's\nexploration of his/her individual\nsource for genuine expression. This program\nis called: Padepokan Lemah Putih,\nMojosongo Seminar.\nPrapto's approach shows parallels to\nthe ancient teachings from his Hindu-Bud-\ndhist Javanese background, yet he has freed\nhimself from the traditional forms and\nthereby has become more accessible to the\nneeds of the Western student.\nAfter working for several years with\nsome of Prapto's authorized instructors in\nEurope, I spent some months in Java\nstudying with him. To go to work directly\nwith Prapto becomes truly necessary at a\ncertain point. It comes from the need to\ndevelop greater depth in the ability to synchronize\nintention, action, and awareness—of\none's expression and of the environment.\nFor me the quality which Prapto\nhelps to develop could be called \"authenticity,\"\nwhich I have found to be lacking in\nthe contemporary cultural climate in Europe.\n\n\nIt All Started with a Question\nBack in 1985, 1 met Min Tanaka, the\nJapanese dancer/farmer, at the Butoh\nFestival in Berlin. After taking a workshop\nwith him there, I became involved\nin a network of training and performance\ngroups that functioned along the\nprinciples of Min's work, which he had\ninitiated and named Body Weather\nLaboratories. Min used to say that his\ndance was about asking questions. It\nwas through his approach that I became\naware of how relaxing the mind\ncan affect movement patterns and vice\nversa, and I started asking myself:\n\"What is meditation?\nAn old friend of mine, Jose Mulder\nvan de Graf, had been studying with\nanother movement master, in Indonesia,\nwhom he affectionately called\n\"Prapto.\" He seemed to be involved in\nsome kind of \"movement in meditation\"\nand so I asked him how to meditate.\nI don't actually remember his answer,\nbut I remember how busy we\nwere at the time comparing notes about\nthe methods and styles of our respective\nmasters. They did have a lot in\ncommon: Both Min and Prapto have\nexperience working with the minds\nand emotions of Western students.\nBoth take the whole environment and\nstate of being of the performer or practitioner\ninto consideration and they\nboth work with the idea of including\neverything, e.g., disturbing noises, all\nconditions of the weather, and all\nthoughts and emotions arising and\nchanging all the time. They both emphasize\nthat one needs to practice this\nalso in one's daily life and both offer\ntwo- to three-month study programs in\ntheir respective countries where the\nstudent has the opportunity to explore\nhis/her states of mind under varying\n\nconditions—in the mountains, by the\nsea, moving in a temple or in the midst\nof a busy Tokyo street. Dance and\nmovement seem more like something\nthat simply occurs in relating with oneself,\nwith others, and with the surroundings,\nrather than something that\nyou do.\nIt took some more years before I\nwas sufficiently \"cooked\" in my own\njuice to want to see what my friend's\npractice looked like. He invited me to\na video showing of Prapto's work in\nJava and a kind of work-demonstration.\nThe video showed Westerners on\nan Indonesian temple site doing flowing\ntai chi-like movements. I wondered,\n\"Why do these movements seem\nso intent on beauty and balance?\" This\nseemed a bit too tame for me. Especially\nin comparison with what I was\nused to from Min's work, in which the\nhuman body was allowed to shed its\ncivilized control and show itself in a\ndisintegrated reduction to sheer existence\nbeyond any familiar aesthetic\nideal.\nNevertheless, I was impressed with\nsome of the students of Prapto. They\nseemed to be gentle and genuine and\nhad a non-dramatic way of going about\ntheir lives and in the way they made\ncontact with others. And above all, I\nwas intrigued by the variety of their\nprofessional backgrounds—there were\ntai chi teachers, healers, musicians,\narchitects, ethnologists, dancers, etc\namong them.\nJoining one of the regular Saturday\npractice sessions in Berlin made me\nunderstand in my body and especially\nwith my awareness what this practice\nmight be good for my own sanity and\na sense of stillness and dignity.\nThe question \"what is meditation?\"\ncame up again in 1988 while I was in\nthe U.S. While there, I took instruction\nin Shamatha-Vipassana meditation and\nbegan reading the books of Tibetan\nBuddhist teacher Chogyam Trungpa. I\nwas finding out about meditation at\nlast.\nIt took until October 1991, two and\na half years later, before I was sitting\non a plane to Java to study with Prapto.\nI went for a three-month course\nwhich he calls \"Vocabulary—Nature\nand Life.\"\n\nMojosongo—Nine Fruits\nPrapto's Land\nA small Combi bus would collect\nour group of eight students every\nmorning to drive from the city of Solo,\nwhere we were all living, to Mojosongo,\na village outside of town where\nPrapto had designed a piece of land as\na practice ground. This land had been\nshaped and cultivated by Prapto with\nhis knowledge of and attitude towards\nnature—\"for goodness.\" A sense of\ndevotion, of relaxation, of beauty and\nof humor marked our first meeting\nwith him there. We saw him arrive\nwith a stick of incense and a blossom\nwhich he offered to a nature shrine before\nwelcoming us.\nThere are four principle areas on\nhis land which were named and\nshaped according to a specific theme.\nIn the first week of our stay, Prapto\nbegan to introduce us to these themes\nand practices and suggested that we\nfind out for ourselves which of the four\nwe would choose for the rest of our\ncourse. This created an intense investigation\nfor each of us into the nature of\nour mind, our patterns and our inner\nintentions. How and what to choose\nbecame a vast mirror of what the work\nat hand was for each one of us in the\nlarger framework of our lives.\nHere are short descriptions of the\nfour areas:\nPENDOPO: This was a rectangular\ncement floor with pillars holding up a\nbamboo roof (and actually the only\nplace with some shade). It was also to\nbe our group practice meeting place.\nPrapto explained that Pendopo represented\nthe sense of \"house,\" of \"staying,\"\nof \"sense of family.\" How to\ndiscover in movement the sense of a\nplace, an anchor, and a place from\nwhich to look out into the world.\nThese were the themes and practices in\nPendopo.\nThe next area was called ROAD. It\nlooked more like a mini-orchard arranged\na bit like a maze, with pathways,\nearth mounds and ditches between\nlines of small mango trees and\nhigher trees (which had lost most of\ntheir leaves overnight, devoured by a\nswarm of caterpillars). \"Road.. .still\nvery difficult for me,\" explained Prapto.\n\"In the sense of being transient, on\nthe move, no reference point to a fixed\nplace.\" It had to do with \"stepping\nout\" beyond one's territory. My first\nthought was: Road as in path. Holy\nShit! I panicked. Not this one, too\ndifficult. Me. Who is always looking\nfor a place to stay...\nMANDALA represents \"the sense\nof circulation, of receptive energy, of\nnature cycles, of feminine principle.\"\nThis area was a Sacred architecture: an\noctagon-shaped cement \"stage\" surrounded\noffering tower with a stone field\naround it; and a big earth mound\nwhich Prapto often called \"Woman\nStupa Hill.\" This was a rather varied\nlandscape, situated somewhat in the\ncentre of the whole land overlooked by\nan even higher hill where a huge Buddha\nstatue sat on his Lotus throne\nshaded by bamboo trees.\nSQUARE: This was a very large\nearth field at the upper end of the land.\nIt seemed lowered into the ground, like\na swimming pool, some steps of earth\nled you onto it. Square represents \"the\nsense of being seen, of a public place,\nin society, being on the stage, interacting\nwith the world. \"You need to find\na door,\" Prapto said when we first\npracticed there. How to relate with\nopen space...?\nWe were given two weeks to explore\nthese four practice areas with\nPrapto in various ways, and then we\nwent on to Borobudur.\n\nMovement Practice on\nBorobudur\nBorobudur is located some 60 kilometers\naway from Solo, and is one of\nthe biggest Buddhist stupas in the\nworld. This ancient monument with\nthousands of Buddha figures has reliefs\nrunning along the many terraces and\nlevels which tell the stories of the Buddha\nand of the Bodhisattvas and depict\nall levels of realization. Prapto himself\nis a Buddhist and before going he\nasked us to bring an offering for the\nmonks of the Mendut monastery nearby,\nwithout giving us the impression\nthat we needed to be Buddhists as\nwell.\nAt Borobudur, Prapto introduced us\nto a meditation in movement practice\nhe calls Reading, which he wanted us to\nexplore on the four sides of the stupa.\nEach of the four sides has a particular\nmeaning which is shown by the mudras\n(hand positions) of the Buddhas on the\nlower terraces.\nPrapto introduced the themes of the\nmudras to us. On the East side, the\nname of the mudra was Calling the\nEarth as Witness to my Enlightenment.\nHere Prapto's suggestion was to work\nfrom the ground, sensing the contact\nwith the earth as a basic way of moving/\na practice in grounding and in\nclearing one's awareness. This related\nto the pacifying aspect of the Buddha\nfamily of Vajra as I found out later\nwhen I studied the \"five Buddha families\"\nin greater depth as they are taught\nThe South side was the mudra of\nGenerosity, which Prapto called \"Offering.\"\nThis relates to the enriching\naspect of the Buddha family of Ratna.\n\nPrapto's suggestion was to practice\nmoving and giving, and being aware of\nlooking out into space.\nOn the West side the mudra is\ntraditionally called Absorption and we\npracticed with the theme of \"Receiving.\"\nThis relates to the magnetizing\naspect of the Buddha family of Padma.\nPrapto described this as a very introverted\nmovement practice.\nThe North side is traditionally the\nmudra of Fearlessness, which Prapto\ncalled \"Go on your way, don't be\nafraid.\" This relates to the Buddha\nfamily of Karma.\nHaving introduced these themes to\nus, Prapto suggested we move freely\naccording to the themes, while trying\nto Read. At that point we all felt a bit\noverwhelmed. The work was a tremendous\nchallenge. This was Prapto's\ndevelopment of a movement practice\naccording to Buddhist principles and\nwas not very easy for us to follow at\nthat point\nSlowly it dawned on us that Reading\nfor Prapto was the actual awareness\nof one's own state of mind in\nmovement, of physical and emotional\nexperiences included in simply being\npresent. Being in a particular place,\nsensing how that place is affecting one\nand how in fact there is less and less\nthe notion of one, in the sense of me.\nIt's more about following the line of the\nmovement and realizing how movement\nis a forever changing experience\nof travelling through space and of\nrelating with whatever comes up—in\nthis sense the masses of tourists or the\nscorching sun on Borobudur were simply\nways to practice \"including\" and\n\"long endurance,\" and practice \"for\ngoodness\" rather than \"doing good.\"\nAnd we began to Read what caught\nour eyes in passing the reliefs, the\nniches, the trees, the rain, the sensation\nof turning a comer from one wall to\nthe next, or of meeting each other from\nafar. A taste of panoramic awareness.\nOur task was enormous and Prapto\nsuggested we find our own way to\nexplore either on only one side, or\ngoing from one side to the next, bringing\nthe previous attitude with us, so\nthat an accumulative effect would begin\nto build.\nIn a clockwise direction, we began\nto explore Reading. What I encountered\nwas a vast sense of space, a sense\nof deep devotion at being on the mountain\nof endless Buddhas looking out\ninto the tropical landscape of mountains\nand high palm trees—a sense of\ntimelessness and a sense of being able\nfor short moments to give up all conscious\neffort to do it right—simply to\nfeel the effect of the place and the\nhugeness of it.\nThis was by no means some \"enlightened\"\nstate of mind; it had more to\ndo with the fact that I was very weakened\nup my usual control, or for that matter\nhold my body in certain ways. One of\nmy fellow students suggested that all I\ncould do was to offer my weakness to\nthe Buddhas and actually it was during\nthat week that Prapto said to me, \"You\nare beginning to be without mirror.\nMore seeing yourself in actual situation.\nOn the table.\" In fact, I was\nexperiencing alone-ness intensely. It\nwas in that moment that I gave in to\nmy \"first thought, best thought\" in\nchoosing a practice, which was Road\n(as in path). I would follow on this\npath for the rest of the course. I just\nsimply gave in.\nDuring the three months, we also\npracticed on the hill, by the ocean and\nat Candi Sukkoh, an ancient fertility\ntemple from the Hindu-Buddhist period\nin ancient Java. To describe each\nplace would exceed the limits of this\naccount.\n\n\"For Human Growing\"\nPrapto's Background\nPadepokan Lemah Putih is the official\nname for Prapto's teaching program.\nPadepokan is the Javanese word for the\nplace in the traditional Javanese aristocratic\ncourt buildings where a state of\nclarity can be reached through meditation.\nLema Putih means white and\ngentle. Padepokan Lemah Putih Mojosongo\nSeminars is the place where\nartists from Indonesia, Europe, and\nU.S.A. come in order to study self-\nhealing by movement in meditation\nand to explore creative activities in all\nareas of the arts.\nDuring my stay in Java, a phrase\nfrom my Buddhist teacher, Chogyam\nTrungpa Rinpoche, kept coming back\nto me more and more when I was\nmoving; \"We are learning how to become\ngentle and genuine people.\" In\nfact, the longer I stayed, the more I felt\nthat the study and practice with Prapto\nand my Shamatha Vipassana meditation\npractice and Buddhist study were\nless and less different from each other.\n\nActually, when I was doing my formal\nsitting practice, things Prapto had said\nto me came back as meditation instruction\nand vice versa— when I was practicing\nmovement with Prapto, many\nexperiences and principles I had encountered\non the Buddhist path came\nto life for me in an embodied sense.\nThere is a total absence of spiritual\ndogmatism in Prapto's way of working\nwith others. It makes no difference to\nhim whether people are Christian,\nHindu, Muslim or atheists. He has\ndeep respect for people's beliefs and\nhas inspired many of his students to\nsearch for \"their\" spiritual connection\nsimply by how he embodies that dimension\nin his way of life and in his\nway of relating with others. Prapto\nhimself shuns the traditionalist \"monkway\"\nin Buddhism and encourages\npeople to find out, on their own terms,\nwhat Buddhist teachings might mean\nto them from an experiential point of\nview.\nPrapto's first encounter with like-\nminded European movers and performers\nwas about ten years ago while he\nwas performing in Koln, Germany.\nAfter that meeting, the first group of\napproximately five people went to\nstudy with Prapto in Solo for a year or\nlonger. They researched, practiced,\nexchanged and learned from each\nother's cultures and developed this\npractice together. Later they became\nthe first authorized teachers. In a\nsense, Prapto knew veiy little about\nWestern bodies and minds and he had\nto study how to teach them what he\nknew, to acquire tools of conceptual\nand pedagogic communication. On the\nother hand the Europeans, by staying\nin Java, gradually familiarized themselves\nwith a more Javanese way of\nbeing and the way of behavior and\ncommunication which had marked\nPrapto. I have included some excerpts\nfrom an interview by two of his early\nstudents in which Prapto talks about\nhis own background and the purpose\nof his work. This interview, 'Talking\nabout Walking,\" took place in 1985 at\nAryatara Buddhist Institute in Germany\nwith Christina Stelzer and Jose\nMulder van de Graf.\nQuestion: I would, like to know something\nabout your background, about your life.\nPrapto: Since I was a child I always\nfollowed my father. We went to nature,\nwe prayed in mysticism, we went\nto the mountain, to the burials, to the\nshamans. I was very young; I started\nat the age of 6 or 7. We usually were\nin nature, at least once a week. Later I\nstudied movement, Javanese self-defense.\nI studied Kung Fu with Pak\nSutanto and he also did acupuncture.\nThis is a Javanese teacher?\nChinese. I studied Karate, not long,\nand then I studied free movement.\nWho was your teacher for free movement?\nNobody, because at the time I was in a\ndifficult situation in the city I live in, in\nSolo. There is a strong tradition in\ndance, which I like very much, but I\ncould not do it\nWhy?\nIt is not my wear [way].\nIt is not your cloth?\nYes, it is not my cloth. At 25,1 started\nfree movement. My question was,\n\"What shall I do?\" Then I made a\ndecision: I like movement but I cannot\ngo with the traditional line. Then I\nstarted doing it—when the wind blew\nthrough me, I move. When there is\nmusic, I move. I went to the ocean, to\nthe temple, to the mountain, to the\nriver, at night or in the morning. I\ntried to move in any condition. What\nhappened made me sometimes \"fly,\"\nwithout being able to come back for\nmany days or weeks.\nWhat does it mean \"fly\"?\nFly means that I cannot relate with\nothers, because I am confused in my\nbalance.. That is why it is very important\nfor someone to do it within a\nframe, because if it is always changing,\nyou need a frame. Because that is\nsecure. I did this starting in 1970 and I\nbecame very sick in 1974. I went to the\nphysician as a hyper-nervous.. .[he\nlaughs].\n\nHe said you are crazy?\nYes, a little bit [laughter]. Yes, but I still\ncould not find a solution for my situation.\nSuddenly someone asked me to\ngo to a \"Vipassana\" course, a Buddhist\ncourse, and I took a decision, and I left\nmy work. I decided to go whatever\nhappens. In the Vipassana course I\nsaw many people trying to have awareness,\nor clear awareness with what they\ndo, with the simple things, with slow\nmovement. And then I asked myself;\n\"Can I make free movement with this\nmethod?\" And then I did. Everybody\nwas only sitting, but I made movement.\nAt the end of the Vipassana course, I\nprayed with the monk, I was crying.\n. .and then I became very little and\nsaid, \"Please give me a name\"; I became\na follower in Buddha's religion.\nBefore this experience, I did little\nperformances with free movement.\nAfter the Vipassana practice, I did\nperformances with a monk, a real\nmonk. My purpose was, \"OK, I want\nto become free, but please hold me if I\nstart flying\" [he laughs]. He said, \"You\ndo free movement with music and I do\nmeditation.\" This started growing until\nI made a choreography in the art center\nwith the monk, the mantra, with free\nmovement, with other artists, dancers,\nmusicians, with shadow puppets.\n\nTraditional ones?\nNo, from the traditional background,\nbut developed. The name was \"Way-\nang Buddha.\" We performed it first in\n1975 in Mendut and Waysak. This is\none part of the work with art. Practice\nand performance to become one.\nIn my journey in the experience of\nstudying about movement, after Vipassana,\nI could see more...balance. Then\nI had the opinion: free free movement!\nBut also free inside. Free inside also\nmeans: balanced inside. Balance inside\nmeans: no center.\n\nNo center? What is this \"center\"?\nSomething that blocks inside.\nI would like to know what the purpose of\nyour work is.\nThank you. Our life is always changing.\nIt is like changing value, changing\nmovement, changing situation, and so\non, so on. We lose our balance when\nwe are changing. We are afraid of\nchanging, and we are not aware when\nthe changing starts. We don't know\nwhen we begin, when we finish. All\nthis gave me questions for my life. I\ntry to find a work or practice through\nwhich I can get to know what changing\nis. If I change, the question is, how do\nI not lose my balance, how do I not\nlose myself. When I stop I am still\nopen to see what is happening. This\nmeans the need to prepare our body,\nour feeling, our mind. That all is preparing.\nPreparing to find out what is\nmy life. And in this process also to\nclean the body, the feeling, the mind.\nWhat do you mean by saying \"clean\"?\nClean is when you are not holding too\nmuch. If we are holding, it means we\nhave a block. Block means: not alive.\nLife energy cannot go through it The\nblock creates separation between my\nlife and the energy outside. Yes, that's\nwhy in our practice we start with a\nsimple frame: sitting, walking, lying,\ntouching, relation, releasing. That is\ndaily life. But I know, to see this is\nsometimes difficult\nPrapto Teaches Me with a\nBlossom\nDuring our stay in Borobudur, one\nday after lunch we were all sitting\naround a big table together with Prapto\nhaving coffee and speaking about eye-\ncontact and human relations in Javanese\nculture, and then about Western\nculture and especially about the dualis-\ntic struggle within us. I had been feeling\nthis intensely in my practice so I\nasked Prapto about my own struggles\nin daily behavior, seeing it so magnified\nthrough the movement practice.\n\"How can I deal with this? How can I\nfully 'enter' a situation?\" I asked.\nPrapto: \"Please put this flower in front\nof you on the table.\" He pointed to\nsome hibiscus blossoms at the center of\nthe table around which we were sitting\n(a Javanese custom for hospitality). I\npicked up a red blossom from there\nand put it down right in front of me.\nOh... I realized immediately that I had\nnot included my seeing, my feeling or\nmindfulness in the action. I had simply\noperated on automatic.\nPrapto: \"Yes, you see. Do again,\nplease.\"\nI tried again. This time I was very\ntentative, heavy-handed, about what\nmight be a good place and position for\nthe flower.\n\"Not like this. You have one last\nchance,\" he said jokingly.\nThis time, my awareness opened\nsuddenly. I could see the space, the\ntable, the group, the faces, the general\natmosphere and my hand went to the\nblossom and it found the right position\nfor the flower on the table. It felt more\nlike offering the blossom to the space\nand to all present, more like sharing,\nand I felt a tremendous warmth and\naliveness.\nP: \"Yes. Maybe you can practice\nlike this?!\"\nEpilogue: Crystallization\nand Consequences\nTowards the end of our three-\nmonth course, Prapto asked each of the\ngroups from the four practice areas to\ncrystallize their experiences into a final\npresentation.\nThe Road poems I've included here\nbecame part of my project—a dance\nperformance entitled On the Road. The\npoems were \"planted\" as big calligraphic\nsignposts on the paths and\nditches of the Road area, in which\nJacqui, an Australian singer, and myself\nmoved and made sounds. We used\nwords or sounds from the poems, singing\nand walking. Or moving in relation\nto the momentary constellation of\nbird-sounds and singing and children's\nvoices heard from afar. The audience\nwas invited to sit or move in the Road\nas well, so the piece communicated the\nfeeling of being in this landscape (in\nthis land-art event) together. They\ncould choose their own point of view,\nto the performers' movements or to\nfind their own preferences for certain\nspots. This emphasized the theme of\ntranscience very directly.\nDuring our public performance,\nJacqui and I found ourselves unexpectedly\njoined by Prapto. He seemed to\n\"hold\" the space by moving and singing\nMantras on the top of the Woman\nStupa Hill, overlooking the area of the\nRoad. I never asked him the exact\nreason for his joining us, though later\nhe said that he always feels \"pulled to\ngo in the Road\" and also that he still\nfeels himself to be \"baby in the Road,\"\nstressing that it takes much courage to\ngo out on the Road. I agree.\n\nI left Java with a suggestion by\nPrapto that I create my own group, to\ndevelop practice and performance\n\"with a source in Buddhism.\" I felt\nthat Prapto had \"read\" what my deepest\nintentions were, and I suddenly\nknew the kind of group I wanted to\ncreate.\nAfter my return to Europe, I initiated\nthis group, which currently has nine\nmembers from four countries and it\nwas named \"Buddha's Cafe.\" The\nname refers to a joke Prapto once\nmade: he pointed up to the Buddha\nstatue on the hill on his land and suggested\nthat we can \"go up to Buddha's\nCafe, maybe take along some cookies,\"\nwhen we don't know what to do.\n\"Maybe can help you.\"\nBuddha's Cafe is an interdisciplinary\nresearch and performance group\nmeeting several times a year in different\ncities or places to develop projects\n\"on site\" in nature, for museums, festivals\nor for specially chosen locations,\nsuch as the bridges of a medieval town\nin Southern Germany or a landscape in\nNorth Holland, where beach, dune,\nheath, and forest lie very close together\nproposing four different \"climate\nzones.\" The project in Holland will be\nabout passing through the landscape\nfrom four different directions, as a\nperformance caravan, and transporting\nsounds from landscape to landscape.\nThe group's basic work rests on\nsitting and movement meditation practice\nand is trying to include the nature\nof our difficulties in the process—\nnamely that all of us live in different\ncountries and that we struggle always\nwith the limitations of time and resources\nfor our practice and project\ndevelopment meetings. In that sense\nBuddha's Cafe is still \"on the Road,\"\nattempting at the moment to create a\nmore steady and regular base for its\nactivities in Amsterdam, a city where\nquestions of Art and Spirituality have\nbeen discussed widely in the early\n1990s.\n\nROAD 4\n\nLooking out\nfinding my body\nturned around\nbody takes on multiple shapes\nstronger tighter\nfaster lower\nwider inner\nsharper lonely\nsad singing\naffecting my perceptions\nchanging my views\n\n“Can the grass see you?”\nHere is a new\npoint of view\nThank you!\n\nROAD 1\n\nNo battle no project\nno task no aim\nno giving no getting\nno forgetting\nnot forgetting\nno fixed points\nto stick to\nno back pack load\nto carry\nempty handed\nin the road\n\n\nROAD 5\n\nFinding my way\nToday\nmy seeing wanders\nin my feet\nNot looking for\nNot needing to\nNot going anywhere\nNot walking away\nNot searching for\na way to be\nnot to be in my way\nSimple stepping\nFoot Foot\nFoot Foot\nGrass Tree\nGrass Mantra Singing\nGrass Comer\nPath Grass\nStep Step\nMe Me\nSee See\nComer Grass Mandala\nWalk Fast\nWalk Around\nWalk Down\nWalk Across\nWalk Sweat\nWalk Butterfly\nWalk Mantra Singing\nWalk\nand bow\nBow\nand see\nThe Heaven The Earth and Me\nTerima Kasih.\n\nROAD 6\n\nfor Jacqui\nRoad alone\nRoad singing\nShare a glass of water\nA moment of laughter\nRoad together\nNot for long\nGood bye, Jacqui\nC’est un plaisir.\n\n\nROAD 7\nMas Prapto\nRoad alone Adieu\nCrossing the bamboo Bridge\nOh\nNot to disturb the Earth\nHearing the Bird\nStepping\nOh\nSo gently\nThe master comes near\nOh\nSo alone\nButterflies in the Air\nNot to disturb\nThe bridge\nOh\nSo fresh the Air\nOh\nHow careful the Feet\nIn the road\nOh\nHe goes away\nso clear",

    "Content": "SPIRITUALITY\n\n\n\nUntil well into middle-age, I was shaped within\ninstitutions which linked spiritual excellence exclusively\nwith the cultivation of only one of the many dimensions of\nthe body, the upper pole of the vertical axis; spiritual\ndecadence, with the lower pole: first as a Roman Catholic\nyouth, then as a Jesuit seminarian and priest, and eventually\nas a Rolfer. Part and parcel of that teaching was the\nassumption that these communities had access to a trans-\ncultural grasp of reality, to the nude body of Truth underneath\nits colorful ethnic dresses.\nJesus was said to have come down from heaven; dying,\nhe descended into the realms of purgatory to gather the Old\nTestament saints, was raised from the dead and ascended\nback up into heaven. In a second great triumph over the\npower of death, the body of his mother Mary was taken up\ninto heaven, the promise of our eventual ascensions.\nAccording to the abstractions of Christian theology,\nspiritual evolution begins at inanimate rocks, progresses\nupward through plants, fish, birds and mammals until it\nreaches an immeasurable gulf bridged by God’s creation of\nthe soul breathed into mud to make human beings. Then\nthe upward journey continues in the realm of this new\nsoul-world, beginning with virtuous humans, continuing up\ninto the heaven of humans who have died in sanctity, still\nhigher into the multiple ranks of angels, archangels, thrones\nand dominions, seraphim and cherubim, reaching the pinnacle\nof spiritual evolution with the Blessed Virgin in front\nof the throne of the Holy Trinity. In mirror fashion, spiritual\ndegradation descends below the middle-realm of soulless\nmatter through the purgatorial realms of modest human\nvices until it reaches the Stygian barrier of no return, where\nagain it descends through the seven realms of the deadly\nsinners into the lowest region of fallen saints and angels, to\nthe nadir where the highest angel, Lucifer, the light-bearer,\nfell in his pride.\nThe value of a particular class of experiences is measured\naccording to its location on that vertical axis. The\nscale of embodiment reflects that vertical system of values.\nThe middle realm is that of guts breaking up foods to make\nflesh, gas, fat and excrement Vulgar and disgusting, it is\nbarely human. Both virtue and sin, of course, can occur in\nthis realm. The good person is hygienic, regulated, has sex\nonly with wife or husband with genitals in their “natural”\norifices, eats the proper foods and not excrement. Such\nvirtues are hardly worth speaking of among Christians, a\nbare minimum for salvation. And their companion vices\nare modest, at their most extreme worthy only of a pass to\nthe upper balconies of hell, populated by Boschian sodomites\nand adulterers. Saintly good and diabolic evil occur\nonly in the person who stands upright like the old man’s\nstaff, either in prideful defiance of his Lord God and suppression\nof his fellows, or in the saintly offering of his\nintricate brain and elegant posture to the authority of Bible\nor Pope.\nIf asked, any theologian would say that “up” was only\nmetaphorical; heaven and hell were in a different dimension\nthan ours. But the barrage of Christian art, architecture\nand ritual prescriptions taught otherwise, imperceptibly\nhabituating the believer to stretch up ever higher in his or\nher spiritual quest Catholic and High Protestant liturgy are\nmonodirectional, the priests and ministers entering at\nground level processing upward towards the level of the\nchurch, ideally situated on a prominent rise, and even\nfurther upwards into pulpit and high altar. The movement\npatterns in those liturgies are straight-lined, priests, ministers\nand acolytes carrying themselves erect. Bows and\nprostrations are acknowledgements of “higher-ups.” The\ngreat achievements of sacred architecture, whether Romanesque,\nByzantine or Gothic, coax the eye upward, and\nhopefully the soul.\nMonastic orders like the Jesuits give more explicit and\nrefined attention to upward verticality in practices of kneeling,\nsitting upright and standing in meditation. Ignatius\nLoyola’s “Rules of Modesty” reflected the widely held\nassumption that postural verticality served to spiritualize\neveryday activities of sitting at one’s desk or walking down\nthe hallway; in that spirit, the Rules proscribed rotational\nsashaying and swaggering, slouchings and leg-crossings.\nIda Rolf was even more explicit about the spiritual\nsignificance of the upward, pinning it down to the proper\ncant of the cranium on the neck. As my experience of\nlearning to run on the soles of my feet bears witness, she\ndid indeed devote more attention than many students of the\nbody to downward verticality, having developed an elaborate\nset of manipulations for the pelvis, legs, feet and\nankles. Working with her over a decade taught me to\ninhabit my previously vacated nether regions. Her manipulations\nmade me capable of overcoming fears of exploring\nthe delights of the pelvis by learning how to allow genital\nsensations to radiate out through the hips, down the legs,\nup into the torso, producing orgasms that were as heavenly\nas our high-school catechism promised. But that disciplined\nattention to the lower was always in service of\nenhancing the upward movement through the top of the\nhead, where she located spiritual evolution: “This is what\nRolfers are doing: we are lifting a body up. We’re getting\nthe uppermost pole of the body lifted up... It all sounds so\nmuch alike: I will lift up my head; I am lifting toward the\nLord; I am lifting toward the mountain. All religious\nthinking has tended to understand that there was a lifting\nup in terms of growth in the spiritual realms.”1\nThe West’s exaltation of the vertical appears in its most\nabstract form in a long and continuous philosophical tradition,\npopularly called “the perennial philosophy,” beginning\nwith Plato and Aristotle, continuing up to the present day\nprincipally among esoteric thinkers, such as Fritjof Schuon,\na member of the Sufi Order in the West:\n\"...whereas the animal is horizontal and only\nadvances toward itself-—that is, it is enclosed within\nits own form—man, in advancing, transcends himself;\neven his forward movement seems vertical, it\ndenotes a pilgrimage toward his Archetype, towards\nthe celestial Kingdom, towards God. The beauty of\nthe anterior side of the human body indicates the\nnobleness, on the one hand of man’s vocational\nend, and on the other hand of his manner of approaching\nit; it indicates that man directs himself\ntowards God and that he does so in a manner that\nis ‘humanly divine’, if one may say so. But the\nposterior side of the body also has its meaning: it\nindicatesr, on the one hand the noble innocence of\nthe origin, and on the other hand the noble manner\nof leaving behind himself what has been transcended;\nit expresses, positively, whence we have come\nand, negatively, how we turn our backs to what is\nno longer ourselves. Man comes from God and he\ngoes towards God; but at the same time, he draws\naway from an imperfection which is no longer his\nown and draws nearer to a perfection which is not\nyet his.\n\nI first began to question spiritual verticality when I\nmoved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1971 to set up my\npractice as a Rolfer. Living among the remains of the\n2000-year old Anasazi culture, and its heirs in the Tewa\nPueblos of the Rio Grande, I was jarred to discover that\nthis ancient tradition emphasized the spiritual aspects of the\nlower pole. Its most obvious manifestation was in sacred\narchitecture. While Christian churches are ideally placed\non hills, with tall spires, raised altars, and interiors designed\nto uplift, here the ceremonial gathering place was\nthe kiva. Not only was it below ground level, entered by\nclimbing down a ladder, but the most sacred space within it\nwas yet a lower and smaller hole, the sipapu, the gateway\nto and from the realms of the gods who dwelt not only on\nmountain summits, sky and stars, but within the belly of\nthe earth.\nThe Pueblo rituals involve a circulation of downward\nmovement into the kiva, still lower through the sipapu into\nthe depths of the earth, and upward movements out into the\nplazas of the pueblos and further up the holy streams into\nthe sacred mountains. The specific pattern of body-movement\nin these rituals embodies the sacred quality of the\ndownward. In contrast to the ever upward-striving aesthetic\nof Christian-inspired European ballet, the Pueblo dancers\ndrive their feet heavily downward in response to the sonorous\nand repetitive beating of the drums. The ground itself\nbecomes a resonant drum, throbbing with the percussion of\nhundreds of feet. The movement is not exclusively downward;\nthe torso and head remain erect. Like Chinese t’ai\nchi chu'an and qi gong, the movement patterns honor both\npoles of the vertical.\n\nBut even more challenging to my monotheistic metaphysics\nwas the realization that up-down vertical was only\none of many directions honored in their theology. Dance,\nritual movements, the design of costumes and the location\nof homes and kivas within the pueblos honor a multiplicity\nof compass directions, including vectors towards the sacred\nmountains, rivers, and the annual course of sun, moon and\nstars. A traditional healer from the Vancouver region\nwrites of his people’s polydirectional choreography:\n\"Dancing is both a spiritual and a physical\nprayer. For instance, our stomp dance helps us get\nthe life force flowing. When we stomp our feet in\ntime with the drum, we are connecting our spiritual\nroots with Mother Earth’s roots, her veins. At the\nsame time that we’re stomping our feet, our hands\nare dancing. They’re reaching for medicine;\nthey’re reaching for healing and strength. Another\ndance, the spin dance, helps us untie and regenerate\nourselves. We get dizzy from spinning, but\nafterwards we see things differently.”3\nIn addition to sacred architecture, I encountered in the\npueblos another challenge to my heavenward oriented\nspirituality: sitting cross-legged on the ground.\nDuring graduate studies in theology, I had learned of\nthe spiritual significance embodied in images of the sitting\nBuddha. But under the influence of Christian and Rolf\nverticalism, I viewed such practices as earlier, less refined\nstages of spiritual evolution. Moreover, until I lived in\nNew Mexico, I assumed that when native peoples sat on\nthe ground it was not like the aesthetic practice of zazen,\nbut because they were more primitive, lacking the niceties\nof ordinary furniture and European manners. It soon became\nclear that sitting in the sweat circle, meeting lodge,\nor alone in the wilderness during fasts had evolved as a\nspiritual practice for cultivating an intimacy with the earth\nand a more egalitarian feeling for each other. I puzzled\nthat such sitting did not produce among the Pueblo dwellers\nthe kind of collapse that Western theorists said it\nwould; their torsos and heads were unusually erect, not\ncaved in like mine and so many of my Caucasian clients.\nThey also seemed to have qualities that are rare in the\nAnglo world: a coyote irony, a mudhead lack of pretentiousness,\na com-mother easiness with human foibles.\nCross-legged sitting seemed to carry a sense of values that\ncould not be expressed solely in the vertical.\n\nI do not mean to enshrine the cross-legged sitting\nposture. As those of us with back problems know, it is\nmore difficult to get up from that posture. We know the\nrelief of sitting in a chair in contrast with having to sit for\nlong periods without support on the floor or ground. What\nis at issue here is the exclusive identification of any particular\nposture or direction with the spiritual. The point is to\nhave a multi-directional spirituality.\nThe Tewa, for example, sacralize directionality, not as\nirrevocably linked to evolution or degradation, but as indicating\ndifferent spiritual challenges. Virtue and vice on the\nmulti-directional medicine wheel are not identified with one\ndirection rather than another. They invoke the uniquely\ndifferent challenges associated with different directions.\nJourneys to the north involve learning how to survive in\nextremes of temperature variation, keeping oneself warm in\nthe ice, snow and raging winds. Dealing with the south\nrequires one to learn to live with the relentless glare of the\nsun, the always verdant vegetation with its fierce insects\nand reptiles, the dank air. Looking to the east, one is faced\nwith the challenges of wakefulness, the beginnings of\nillumination; to the west, with the inception of darkness,\nthe monsters of the night, the end.\nThe native elders, as much as Christians, are concerned\nabout human values—love, compassion, truth-telling, honoring\nrelatives, caring for the needy. They do not, however,\nassociate these virtues exclusively with uprightness, but\nalso with downwardness, frontwardness, backwardness,\nsidewardness and round-aboutness.\nIn my encounters with the Rio Grande culture, I began\nto get a sense that the institutions which shaped me were\ntrying to reach too high too fast, neglecting the more basic\nrealities of trees, animals, clear water and air. I became\naware of a weariness deep in my bones caused by an overreaching,\na world-weariness which I could see in other\nWestern idealists, Christian, Marxist, Freudian, and Positivist,\nalways rushing somewhere else in a hurry to change the\nway things are, convinced that we possess the unique path\nto Truth, failing in that Promethean rush to see the beauty\nat hand, with its alternative truths. Attending the seasonal\nrituals in the pueblos and hiking among Anasazi ruins in\nthe canyons of the Pajarito plateau were eroding my destiny-freighted\nviewpoint that I belonged to a special community\nin possession of the true story into which other stories\nhad to be translated.\n\nIn 1976, by strange coincidence I had as clients two\nwomen who were about the same age and had remarkably\nsimilar body-structures. One was Hopi, whom I will call\n“Iris;” the other, Japanese-American, “Rowena.” They\nboth complained of extreme back pain, Iris in her lower\nback; Rowena in her upper back and neck. Yet they both\nhad spinal columns which appeared to be nearly perfectly\nstraight That straightness puzzled me.\nIda Rolf, like many specialists in the area of body\nstructure, had argued that our evolution from primates\nleaves us—that is, all human beings—in an awkward state\non the way towards the upright posture at which we have\nnot yet arrived. According to her and many other experts\nin body structure, a major symptom of that unfinished\nevolution is a frontward curvature, “lordosis,” of the vertebrae\nof the lower back and neck. A well-known specialist\nin physical medicine goes so far as to call these two lordotic\ncurvatures, “man’s antigravity destiny.”4\nThe manipulative techniques of Rolfing, which by then\nI had practiced for five years, were designed to lengthen\nthe tissues surrounding those vertebrae with the goal of\nfreeing the spinal column to right itself towards the imaginary\nplumb line of the Rolf Template. (Despite subtle\ntechnical arguments about the precise shapes of the ideal\nspinal contours, people like F. M. Alexander, Moshe Feld-\nenkrais and Fran9oise M6zieres, including the schools of\nchiropractic and osteopathy, structured their body manipulations\naround similar goals.)\nBut after several sessions with Iris and Rowena within\nthe Rolf context, I could no longer avoid the fact that their\nspinal columns did not have the destined antigravity\ncurves; theirs were virtually straight. I felt like I had\nreached to open a door and, because the knob slipped off\ninto my hand as I stepped forward to walk through it, I\nbumped right into it I was in darkness, not comprehending\nwhat I saw and felt in their necks and lower backs.\nUntil I encountered these two women, there had been a\nrelatively easy relationship between my ideas of the body\nand the feelings in my hands on another person. The way\nthat I organized my touching people from session to session\nhad produced generally good results, and I had some\nconfidence that I knew what I was doing. I had taken for\ngranted that everyone’s spinal column more or less followed\na relatively standard pattern of deviation from the\nnormal, based on the assumption that as human beings we\nwere all at the same stage of biological evolution. I also\ntook for granted that differences of perception and world\nview followed a similar pattern of deviation from a set of\nuniversal -truths valid for all. I had, of course, always\nknown that other people were different from me, often\nradically so. But I had always assumed that those differences\nwere essentially superficial: although a person standing\non a mountain sees things differently from a person in\na swamp, the same kind of looker, with the same fundamental\nstructures, peers out of those two different locations.\nAt a deep level, all humans saw things the same\nway, if they were honest according to the norms of Western\npsychology, and their body structures were on the way\ntowards the Rolf Line.\nIt took an intimate meeting with two people from ancient\ncultures different from my own to make me realize\nthat I could not inhabit anyone else’s viewpoint. Here I\nknew that I could not see and feel things the way they did.\nBut not because of anything they said or any peculiar\nfeelings they expressed: in idiom, expression of emotions,\nand life-style, they were as thoroughly Americanized as I\nor any other of my clients. Outside of those sessions, it\nwould never have occurred to me that Iris and Rowena\nwere so foreign to my sensibilities. My humbling sense of\ntheir otherness came exclusively from the rupture between\nmy sensations of them and the Rolf ideas guiding my\nhands-on work.\nIn that conceptual blackout, I was forced to turn to\nsomething more primal than the Template and Recipe. I\nwas left with bare intuition and simple sensations of my\nhand touching them with more inquisitiveness than before.\nI had to pay more attention to the subtle responses of their\nflesh to my touch, and give more weight to their verbal\nfeedback, having to reach out to them more than usual,\nasking them questions about their responses, about who\nthey were.\nIn the case of Rowena, the results of our work over a\nperiod of three months were very modest, her neck pain\nabating somewhat, but not enough to excite her about our\nwork. I was unable to make much headway in finding how\nto contact her bodily tissues, or her personality in a meaningful\nway. I eventually lost touch with her.\nThings were different with Iris. Like myself, she was\nstumbling her way along a rocky spiritual path. She had\nbeen so frightened as a child by the spiritual powers of her\ngrandparents, that she had renounced the old ways and\nopted for the life of a secular artist. But in recent years,\nshe was finding her way back to her culture, and was now\nengaged in reviving the traditional Hopi methods of weaving\nand pottery. Our interactions produced the sparks of\nfriendship. In that context of personal connection, I was\nable to find subtle ways of using my hands to evoke movement\nfrom the tissues deep within her bodily structure.\nShe experienced significant relief for her back pain from\nour sessions and returned periodically for work over a\nnumber of years.\nStrangely enough, after my conceptually clear ways of\nproceeding were disrupted by not knowing what to do next,\nI felt more like Ida Rolf, who never seemed to be occupied\nuniqueness of the bodily tissues of the person with whom\nshe was working. For her and for other effective Rolfers\nwith whom I have worked over the years, the Template\nfunctioned more as a background theme, with the felt sense\nof the individual in the foreground. I had been so immersed\nin the world of concepts that the Template captivated\nan inordinate amount of my attention. Being forced to\nfind some other way of relating to these two women helped\nme along the pilgrimage out of the brittle world of theories\ninto the immediacy of flesh and emotion.\nIn the attempt to make sense of what I was feeling and\nseeing in Rowena and Iris, a glimmer of light came from\nnoticing that their physical structures were not completely\nunfamiliar. Although they did not look like what Euro-\nAmerican physical experts said all spines looked like at\nthis point in evolution, they did remind me of other forms I\nhad seen. Iris mirrored what I had often seen among\ninhabitants of the pueblos. Her physique had the unusual\ncombination both of solidity and grace that I had been\nnoticing when I was walking the narrow streets of Walpi or\nShungopavi, taking part in the bean dances, watching the\nkachinas emerge from the kivas with the snow-capped San\nFrancisco peaks in the background. Rowena reminded me\nof images I had seen in Asian art, dance, and meditation\npostures.\nFrom my earlier studies of Renaissance philosophy, I\nwas familiar with the perception of the human body as the\nmicrocosmic reflection of the cosmos, an image which I\ntook to be biological and soulful: the cellular intricacies of\nthe body contained all of the intricacies that one could find\nin the universe; the soul by virtue of its capacities to question\nand love, was a representation of the spiritual vastness\nof reality. But here I was confronted with the macroculture\nin the microculture. My contact with each of these women\nwas not simply a matter of one person touching another\nwith certain therapeutic goals in mind, nor just the interaction\nbetween two people complicated by the psychodynamics\nof unique family histories, one male the other female,\nwith all of those complications. It was an encounter between\ntwo different embodiments of ancient rituals, culturally\nsanctioned postures and movement patterns, cuisine,\nattitudes towards sexuality, disease, birth and death.\nAt this our fin de siecle, we know a lot about the dangers\ninherent in such meetings. On the one hand, there are\nthe outbursts of creativity which one finds in the coming\ntogether of artists, scientists, athletes, spiritual teachers, and\ncommunity organizers from different cultures. But there\nare also the many forms of colonization where the practices\nof one culture are subsumed by another, co-opted, brutalized,\neven eliminated.\nMy reflections on my work with Iris and Rowena made\nme painfully aware that I had deceived myself in thinking\nthat I had left behind missionary zeal when I put aside my\nJesuit soutane. I was confronted by the humbling realization\nthat the colonial mentality existed deeper within my\nneuropeptides. I was still engaged in an attempt to convert\npeople to a particular view of the world. Instead of using\nmy skills to help my clients find their unique ways to\nrespond to the challenges offered by their own histories to\nliberate and enrich their own points of view, I was attempting\nto mold them into someone else’s notions about experience.\nI had taken the Rolf Line for the privileged path to\nTruth, applicable to all people, when, in fact, it is just an\nunusually useful symbol created by an upper middle-class\nLong Island woman, inspired by some sixty years of successful\nhealing work almost exclusively with upper-class\nwhite people in the United States and Great Britain. It has\nneither more nor less relation to absolute truth than many\nother ideals.\nAs I attempted to extricate myself from the confusions\nprovoked by trying to alleviate the pain of Iris and Rowena,\nI came across the work of a small group of scholars\nwho have organized their research around die brief 1933\nessay of Marcel Mauss, “Les techniques du corps” By\n“techniques of the body,” Mauss meant the wide range of\nactivities which shape the protean body of the infant into\nan adult, ranging from styles of caring for infants, to gender\nformation, styles of work, exercise, sexual postures,\ndance and ritual. He argued that these activities, which\nseem so “natural,” are actually highly articulated expressions\nof a particular culture’s values; if you examine any\nparticular technique such as using a shovel, you will find\nthat the technique, and the body it goes towards shaping,\ndiffer from culture to culture. During the past sixty years,\nthat thesis has been substantiated by a number of anthropological\nresearchers.5\nThose events initiated me into what has now been a\ntwenty-year study of the variety of ways in which different\ncultures organize their values, and how those values are\nexpressed in bodily practices. With my clients, I let myself\nbe drawn away from the overwhelming domination of\nabstract ideas about body structure into primal senses of\nbody movement, of the feel of my palm on another’s skin,\nand of the impact of another’s voice, leaving me with a\nmore intimate emotional contact with other persons and the\nworld. As my path veered in that direction, I was struck\nhaunt our personal relationships and our social world; it\nwas a path of common sense, uncluttered with the jabber of\ncenturies.\nIn light of those kinds of experiences my eventual\ndiscovery of Emilie Conrad-Da’Oud felt like bumping into\na long-lost friend deep in back-country wilderness. I am\ngoing to give some of the details of her life and the evolution\nof her work as a way of showing how these multicultural\nideas about the body might be applied.\nO\nEmilie created her Somatics method, Continuum, when\nshe, like myself, found herself having to work her way out\nof a squeeze between two cultures. Bom and raised in\nBrooklyn during the thirties and forties, she says that she\nwas driven as an adolescent to look for something more\nprimal than she found in everyday life. At first she imagined\nthat she could find it in primitive dance, and began\nstudying with its leading teachers, Katherine Dunham,\nPearl Primus and Sevilla Fort She went to Haiti in 1955,\nwhere she spent five years studying Haitian dance and\nreligion, even starting her own dance troupe there. A dark\nSephardic Jew, she became even darker, braiding her hair\nand taking on the character of the Island women to such an\nextent that Eastman-Kodak photographers on a search for\n“beauties of the Caribbean,” photographed her. When she\nreturned to New York in 1960, she was confronted with\nthat photograph mounted on the Grand Central billboard\nover the title “La Belle Creole.” She realized that something\ndrastic had happened to her in between the two cultures;\nshe describes it as entering a long-term existential\nbreakdown related to “the dissonance between the liquid,\norganic rhythms of Haiti and the frantic, manufactured pace\nof Manhattan.”\nWithout her realizing it, her physical appearance had\nbecome so altered that she looked like a Haitian and was\nunable to get the kinds of jobs that had been readily available\nto her before she left New York. She turned to professional\nmodeling and the teaching of primitive dance.\n\nOn occasion, she and her troupe did performances in nightclubs\nbased on voodoo rituals. One night during an ecstatic\nsolo fire dance, she reports that she suddenly felt she\nhad “crossed over, beyond the possibility of ever coming\nback.” That “crossing over” meant for her the breakdown\nof her culture, with all of the categories of meaning and\nbodily expression. The dissolution was so far reaching that\nit would take her some years to create a replacement. In\nthe meantime, she had to put up with an uncomfortable,\nsometimes almost psychotic sense of disorientation, which\nshe now attributes to the fact that she was strongly resisting\nthe implications of that deeper sense of her body for\nthe outlines of a new view of reality. Her anchor in reality\nbecame a series of events in which she found herself returning\nwith increasing clarity into a primal area of experience.\nIn this disoriented condition, she entered into a new\nmarriage in 1963 and moved to Los Angeles. In 1964,\nlearning to drive for the first time, she lost control of her\nVW bug convertible on the Santa Ana Freeway and collided\nwith a semi-truck. In the instant before collision, at\nwhich point her VW was totally destroyed, her entire life\nflashed in front of her. She felt a hand come down over\nher and say “No!” She emerged from the wreckage without\na scratch, with the feeling that the “no” was a warning\nthat it was dangerous for her to continue fighting so hard\nto hold away what she had learned from the cultural crossover.\nThen in 1967, she finally went all the way into what\nshe calls her “black hole.” She describes herself as “falling\ncompletely apart,” unable to get out of bed to go to her job\nas a model. She continually felt dizzy and was besieged\nfeeling came upon her, followed by the appearance\nof a “screen” before her eyes, on which she saw with great\nclarity detailed scenes of ancient cultures. At the same\ntime, her body began to move in certain ways which she\nrecognized as what she was looking for when twenty years\nbefore she set about studying primitive dance. It was her\ngood luck to have been in therapy with a psychiatrist who\ndid not view her experience as pathological, but recognized\nit as an interim condition between systems of meaning, one\nof which had lost its sense, the other of which was just\nbeginning to form. Confident that she was bringing something\nforth, he encouraged her to go into her visions and\ntry to make sense of them.\nShe describes her crisis as falling into a crack between\ntwo cultures and finding her own body underneath the\ncultural forms of each. “I had to give up everything I\nbelieved. I saw that what I called ‘my body’—how I\nmoved, talked, even how I thought—was a cultural imprint.\nWith all my training, I had been teaching ‘my body’ to\ndance. But deep inside there was already a dance going\non, if I would perceive it—a dance of myriad movement\nforms beyond anything I could think of. I had to feel it. I\nhad to let it guide me.”6\nI want to underscore the commonplace illusion that\ntook so long for Emilie to unravel. It is the notion that\n“New York” represents a complex, highly evolved cultural\nform while primitive dance is “natural.” (For Emilie and\nother Somatics theorists, “natural” meant “better,” while for\nother people, it means “of less value.” Neither view is\naccurate.) Lying in her bed, moving to her visions and\nvoices, she realized that both New York and Haiti are\nequally sophisticated cultural forms, each shaping the raw\nmaterials of life. Her long sought-after “primitive” had\nalways existed in movements which are occurring in us\nwilly nilly: cellular, respiratory, circulatory, peristaltic,\nnervous, lymphatic, micro-muscular.\nAs with other Somatics innovators like Alexander,\nFeldenkrais, and Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen, it took Emilie\nseveral years to distill those experiences into a definitive\nmethod. The first stage was in response to people who\nasked her to teach primitive dance, which she used as a\nvehicle for teaching those more basic kinds of movements.\nA second crucial stage was her puzzling about the nature\nof paralysis. If the very essence of material reality is\nmovement, what does it mean when a person has a pathology\nthat manifests itself in immobility?\nWith that question in mind, she began working with\npeople with severe neuromuscular disorders, and from them\nlearned more clearly what was involved in her own experiences.\nShe worked with a twenty-three year old woman,\nSusan, who had been partially paralyzed by polio since age\none. She had always been told by physicians that she\nwould never recover movement in her left leg, because\ncurrent medical belief assumes that polio causes muscles\nand nerves to degenerate in such a way that the paralysis is\nirreversible. Working without any familiar concepts of\nspinal alignment to guide her, as I had been forced to do\nwith Iris and Rowena, Emilie simply stayed present with\nher hands on the young woman’s body. She sat like this\nfor hours at a stretch, giving no instructions, not even\nguiding her in visualizations. At first, Susan felt only heat.\nThen one day the leg began to shudder and move in\nstrange ways that were similar to the ways that Emilie had\nfound herself moving in her bed. Over a four-year period\nof weekly four-hour sessions, many of which were observed\nand subjected to electromyographical analysis in the\nUCLA kinesiology laboratory, Susan manifested a range of\nsubtle and finely articulated movements.\nEmilie’s experience with Susan and similar cases led\nher to recognize the healing capacities in movements that\nare not ordinarily attended to in the public world, in fact\nmovements that a culture may not even recognize as movements.\n“Paralyzed people,” she writes, “can feel movement\ninside their bodies, but because our culture does not value\nthis kind of movement, they think they cannot move.\nHelping Susan get in touch with the movement within her\natrophied leg allowed the inner movement to surface and\nripple across the skin and eventually enabled Susan to lift\nher leg.”7\nAnother clue came to Emilie from her inner voices, one\nsaying to her: “Your movement is too muscular; sound will\nlead you into a more refined level of movement” She\nrealized how easy it is for a person who deliberately undertakes\nmovement—exercise, dance, sports, even “Sensory\nAwareness”—to adopt a familiar muscular pattern. She\nbegan to use sound to find something else. She would\ndeliberately create unfamiliar sounds such as those resulting\nfrom directing sounds far back in the throat or vibrating\nthe tongue against the palate. She would sit and observe\nthe kinds of movements that would be generated\nthroughout the interior of the body, allowing those movements\nto reverberate, sometimes to the point of moving her\nbody in space.\nOn the basis of those experiences, her work evolved\nfrom teaching primitive dance and working as a hands-on\nhealer to a radically simplified form she calls Continuum,\nwith which she helps large groups of people experience\nnatural though unfamiliar movements, and explore how\nthose movements might affect everyday life. She might\nhave a group spend several hours initiating the tiniest\nmovements of a finger or knee and then exploring the\nripples of subtle reactions put into action by those micromovements.\nOr she might suggest spending hours, even\ndays, making tiny, virtually inaudible sounds, observing\ntheir effects throughout the interior regions of the body.\nLike Rolfing, the experiences of Continuum are radically\nsensual; they are not visualizations, images or ideas.\nThey seduce one’s attention from the chatter of inner conversations\nand the barrage of colorful images, as Buddhist\nmeditation does, deep into the immediacy of a specific\nmovement. At the same time, the consciousness provoked\ntraditionally identified with the spiritual: the dissolution of\nexperienced barriers between self and other, body and\nmind, self and physical world.\nWhile I had found that many anthropologists and scientists\nhad studied the embodiment of culture, Emilie was the\nfirst whose actual method of Somatics reflected those ideas.\nHers is a deconstructive work that allows one to probe into\nthe more basic movements that have given rise to a particular\ncultural form. Different spiritual traditions have put\ntheir attention on one or a few primal movements—sitting,\nbreathing, sensing. Over time, sometimes centuries, they\ndevelop their rituals and meditation practices by collective\nrepetition and refinement of that family of movements.\nThe resultant experiences produced their culturally unique\nsomatospiritual practices: zazen, hatha yoga, t’ai chi\nchu’an, sufi whirling, the hesychastic breathing of Russian\nOrthodox mystics. As the practices grow older and become\nmore formalized, their roots in the more basic spontaneous\nmovements are forgotten. Continuum, not unlike\nEdmund Husserl’s eidetic phenomenology,8 teaches a person\nhow to investigate any particular form, ranging from\nmeditation postures to forms of calisthenics, and find one’s\nway into the primal movements that have become somatically\nconceptualized in that particular way.\nAn impossible separation between “nature” and “culture”\nis not the issue here. The words that have seemed\napt both for my own experiences and for Emilie’s are\nfunctional ones like “basic,” “simple,” “primal.” When I\nlost a sense of what to do in my work with Ms and Rowe-\nna, I had to turn to simpler forms of touch, seeing and\nlistening. In the depths of what she calls the “black hole”\nof her existential breakdown, Emilie let herself move in\neven more idiosyncratic ways than she had learned in\n“primitive” dance, using movements that do not appear on\nthe maps of Western medical kinesiology.\n\nThe rapid proliferation of inter-cultural knowledge at\nthis moment in history has evoked a number of responses.\nOne is to try for a homogenization of human beings, reducing\nthem to the lowest common denominators: Levi’s,\nMcDonald’s, Madonna. Another is to retreat in fear into\nenclaves of one’s own kind, churches, walled suburbs, and\nrococo theologies. Still another is to junk one’s own culture\nand adopt the costumery of another. None of these\nmoves are promising for healing the ragged tears in our\nsocial fabric; they are, rather, movements of despair.\n\nA turn to more primal realities could lay the groundwork\nfor methods of joining with people of many cultures\nand ideologies in journeys of investigation into how we\nmight deal with common problems of hunger, disease,\nbroken relationships, and a poisoned environment. And\nhow we might celebrate our shared delight in clear air and\nwater, in touching and being touched with affection, in care\nfor one another.",

    "Content": "interview with choreographer Russell Dumas\n\n\nRUSSELL DUMAS has danced with\nsome of the major dance companies of\nthe world including The Royal Ballet,\nBallet Rambert, Netherlands Dance\nTheatre and the Companies of Twyla\nTharp and Trisha Brown. For the\npast fourteen years he has choreographed\nin Australia as director of\nDance Exchange.\nDefining his role as a choreographic\nartist in broad yet rigorous\nterms, he has been active not only as a\nchoreographer, performer and teacher,\nbut as a critical analyst, dance theorist\nand writer. More recently the Dance-\nlink program, established by Dumas in\n1985, has seen him functioning as a\nkind of cultural ambassador, promoting\nand coordinating international\nexchange between dance artists from\nthe USA, Europe, Asia and Australia.\nSpeaking of his own choreographic\npractice Dumas says that he is not\ninterested in dance in the typical mimetic\nor narrative form, but rather one\nthat poses and explores questions. In\nhis approach to making dances he\nuses ideas drawn from various cultures,\npractices and disciplines such as\nanthropology, philosophy, and film. In\nthe final realisation of his choreography,\nhowever, he is a purist, preferring\nto show the dance movement\nalone without dependence on other art\nforms.\nFor Russell Dumas, dance is not a\nperipheral entertainment but is central\nto the business of living. His work in\nAustralia has been directed to the\nrealisation of his vision of dance as a\npowerful and resonant cultural force,\na means by which we might come\nmore fully to comprehend, celebrate\nand debate our society and our world.\nIn this interview Russell Dumas\noutlines the development of his choreographic\nphilosophy and method\nwith a detailed discussion of a number\nof recent works.\nRough Curs (mo)\nDEMPSTER: Could we talk about the\nstructure and development of your\npiece Rough Cuts? How was the\noriginal material generated?\nDUMAS: Rough Cuts was built from\nten phrases of increasing length—the\nfirst phrase was a one count, the second,\ntwo counts and so on. Each of\nthe phrases dealt with a particular\nkinaesthetic memory or movement\nexperience and some of them referred\nback to specific moments in my own\ndance history. For example, one\nphrase relates to my work with Trisha\nBrown. This movement is for me\nquintessentially Trisha—something to\ndo with looseness in the joints. In\nanother phrase there is an aikido-like\nmovement from Rose-Marie Wright\n(of the Twyla Tharp company). The\nfourth phrase was something to do\nwith childhood memories and the\nmovement of waves—the breaking and\nthrowing and spreading and drawing\nback of waves, the body drawing\ndiagonal lines like body surfing.\nThese phrases are like sentences, very\nparticular, very precisely drawn. The\nprocess of refining the material involved\ntaking movement back to an\norigin, the often forgotten thing it was\nanchored in. The movement was\netched in my body and I was concerned\nto be able to show its derivation.\nDEMPSTER: How did that relationship\nbetween movement and memory express\nitself in the development of the\nphrases? Did you find movement first,\nwhich then triggered memory, or vice\nversa?\nDUMAS: Well, it was a bit of both.\nSome of the material was arrived at\nintuitively, while some was worked on\nquite consciously. But the original\nphrases were made fairly quickly and\nthis was pleasurable to do. The next\nstage was about distancing myself\nfrom that material by applying a grid\n[Figure 1]. This is quite an arbitrary\nprocess and it is something I first\nencountered with Twyla. Her intent\nwas different from mine; she didn’t\nuse the grid with such a dancerly\nfocus. A process like this would be\njust one part of a whole armament of\ntechniques and devices she deployed at\nvarious times to alter material.\nWhat interested me in working\nwith this grid structure was the possibilities\nit suggested for juxtaposition of\ninformation embodied in the individual\nmovement phrases, and the making of\nnew information and new insights\nfrom that juxtaposition. The process\nwas partly about displacing the techniques\nimplicit in the original material.\nTo illustrate what I mean by that:\nif you study say Graham technique\nintensively you’ll tend to reproduce a\nGraham-like style of movement. The\nmore persuasive the physical technique,\nthe stronger its influence will\nbe. If you don’t separate yourself\nfrom it, the technique indelibly marks\nyour body, your mind and your kinaesthetic\nmemory. When you apply a\ngrid structure such as this you open up\ngaps between yourself and the technique;\nyou make other choices available.\nDEMPSTER: The two stages—first\nmaking the movement phrases and\nthen using them as the basis for another\ncompositional process—were quite\nseparately conceived and executed?\nDUMAS: Yes, and each of the phrases\nwas also developed autonomously.\nThe rhythmic structure and the counts\nare not consistent across the ten phrases,\nand I didn’t make cuts from one\nphrase to the next so that they could\nfit easily. The transitions that I was\ninterested in were the most difficult,\nthe most virtuosic, and not those that\nwere most natural or inevitable. Of all\nthe many possibilities presented by the\ngrid I’d look at the most difficult\nphysical transitions and choose to do\nthose. You’d have a ten count phrase\nthat was almost physically impossible\nand therefore this would be the most\ninteresting to do.\nDEMPSTER: The materials you begin\nwith are not at all simple, but they\nhave an organic, kinetically logical\nfeel about them. Using the grid you\nembark upon a complex process of\nfirst defamiliarising, and then ‘naturalising’\nor reclaiming that material as\nyour own.\nDUMAS: Yes. The body takes over\nagain. The intellectual labour undertaken\nin learning the new coordinations\nis made bodily; it’s dropped to\nthe muscles and becomes part of the\nbodily memory. I was interested in\nthe idea of the intelligence of the body\nmaking sense of what were quite arbitrary\ncuts. But I didn’t want it to\nremain a conscious thing and to present\nsomeone dancing in a very intellectual\nway. The movement had to be\nreassimilated into the body so that it\ncame out seamlessly.\nDEMPSTER: How long did you work on\nthe piece and in what form was it\nfinally presented?\nDUMAS: Stephanie St. Clair and I\nworked on it for months. The eighteen\nminute duet alone took five\nmonths, and we did nothing else during\nthat time. The permutations were\nendless and we eventually decided that\nit was counter-productive to continue\nto explore new possibilities. We\nreached the limit of what we could do\norganically, and so made some decisions\nso that it didn’t continue to be\nan intellectual thing while we were\ndancing. Nevertheless right up to the\npoint of performing it we were rehearsing\nwith bits of paper. The material\nkept escaping; it was very slippery,\nvery difficult and we kept having\nto go back to our notebooks and plans.\nThe duet was built by following\nalternate lines through the grid and\nwhere phrases passed from one to the\nother we made bridging sections.\nSometimes we swapped materials—\nStephanie would take my phrase and I\nwould take hers. It became highly\ncomplex.\nThe piece was originally presented\nDownstairs at the Seymour Centre. I\nset up three video monitors in the\nspace and the piece began with the\noriginal phrases on video. The video\nwas meant to evoke the past of the\nmaterial and to present it in its first\nvery concrete form. I also wanted to\nhave music present, but as a memory\nor trace. Again this was a connection\nto childhood and my experience of\nmusic examinations, waiting in corridors,\nhearing fragments of music from\nbehind closed doors. So what I did\nwas to locate the music in an adjacent\nroom. There was a grand piano in a\nroom off a corridor adjacent to the\nperforming area, and throughout the\npiece a pianist practised Bach, going\nover and over particular figures and\npassages. The piece started with the\nmaterial on video monitors, the music\nstarted somewhere into that, then\nStephanie began a solo, and the duet\nfollowed.\nDEMPSTER: Would you consider reconstructing\nRough Cuts, performing it\nas a full-length work again?\nDUMAS: Not this one. All I will get\nback from it is the solo you saw the\nother day. That’s stuck forever in my\nmemory. It’s like a raft to the past;\nand the pleasure of performing it again\nis in the memory it evokes, memory\nthat is particular because I can still\ntrace its origins. I can go back to the\norigins of the movement and although\nthe dance no longer looks like the\noriginal it has a certain smell, feel,\nperfume, texture which evokes those\nparticular parts of my memory. When\nit falls apart and I can’t remember the\nsequencing, all I’ve got to do is concentrate\non locating the memory of a\nparticular move. If I find one physical\nmove clearly enough it will spark my\nkinaesthetic memory and that one\nmoment can in turn cue the whole\nphrase.\nThat solo links me in a direct way\nto eight years ago, but I dance it now\nwith a body that is eight years older\nand which has had other experiences,\nother insights.\n\n\nOn Virtuosity, Training,\nand the Persona of the\nPerformer\n\n\nDEMPSTER: A work like Rough Cuts\nmakes precise technical demands upon\nthe dancer, but the dancer’s skill will\nnot necessarily be apparent to a viewer;\nthe virtuosity is not displayed as\nsuch. Was it your intention to mask\nthe virtuosity involved in the dancing\nor was this effect simply the logical\noutcome of the process embarked upon\nin that work?\nDUMAS: Well it was both. I have\nalways been interested in virtuosity\nand in what I couldn’t quite do, but I\ndidn’t see much value in virtuosity as\nit has been traditionally defined in\ndance. The limits that people often\ndefine virtuosity by—the entrechat, for\nexample—always seemed to me to be\nfairly dumb, too obvious or just vulgarly\nmuscular. They represent a very\nlimited notion of the body’s capacity\nand potential. It seemed to me that the\nbody had all kinds of abilities that we\ndidn’t use.\nIn Rough Cuts the dancing was at\ntimes like a series of stumbles that this\nintelligent body was recovering from.\nWe threw ourselves from one dangerous\nthing to another and it may have\nappeared as if we were just making it\nup in the moment The idea of the\nbody being able to make sense of all\nthese disparate things interested me. I\nwanted to explore the body’s innate\nability to respond to the questions and\nproblems it was presented with.\nSometimes those questions and problems\ninvolved, or at least implied, a\npsychological dimension. The demands\nthe dance made upon the dancer\nweren’t always or only physical. It\nwas often to do with memory and the\nability not only to organise and order\nbut to recall sensation and feeling\nprecisely.\nWhat I was interested in then and\nwhat I continue to be interested in\ntoday—in some ways what I am calling\nvirtuosity—is related to the information\nthat has emerged from disciplines\nlike Todd alignment and the\nAlexander Technique. My notion of\nvirtuosity is informed by knowledge\ndrawn from those sources; it is very\nmuch to do with efficiency of action.\nDEMPSTER: Traditional dance techniques\npresume not only defined standards\nand types of technical proficiency\nbut also particular styles of delivery\nor performance presence on the part\nof the dancer. Rough Cuts is developed\nfrom heterogeneous sources,\ninsofar as the original ten phrases are\nlinked to very different periods of your\nown history. In performing this work\nyou’re slipping between many different\nexperiences and different kinds of\ndance materials.\nThese materials in their original\nform suggest very contrasting ideas\nabout the persona of the performer\nand the nature of technical expertise\nrequired of him or her. But the work\nwhen performed is not at all eclectic.\nDUMAS: In order to perform the material\nand to achieve some organic unity\nin the dancing, I had to look outside\ntraditional techniques and the information\nafforded by them. I had to focus\non joint action, on thoroughly analysing\nhow the actions worked. This\nprocess has led me to new insights\nabout the body, about physical virtuosity\nand about training.\nIn this respect my work is very\nmuch a product of what happened in\nthe 1960s and 1970s, to the idea of the\nbody in dance, and to ideas concerning\nthe training of the body. These ideas\nfocused upon functionality and the\naesthetics of function. The idea of\ndealing with what was appropriate\nparticularly interested me. It meshed\nwith my experience of Japanese culture\nand with my understanding of\nHaiku. What was appropriate work\nwas not always the most beautiful.\nMovement had to have a certain robustness.\nIt was beautiful because of\nits use; it was beautiful in use. In\nsome sense I feel that my background\nin classical ballet predisposed me to a\ncertain kind of culturally outmoded, or\npartially outmoded form—a kind of\nhigh courtly tradition which seemed to\nhave lost its way. The traditional\ndance techniques we had were all\nabout control and mastery of the body;\ngravity was to be conquered. The new\ntechniques that I was introduced to in\nthe 1970s acknowledged the subjectivity\nof the dancer. Time was invested\nin the experience of sensation and\nfeeling. These techniques gave value\nto the sense of trusting the body, of\nreturning to the body as authority,\nrather than it being something that had\nto be overcome. The body information\nthat was surfacing in modem\ndance in the 1960s and 1970s had\nbeen around earlier but came through\nas a rich vein at that time because the\nculture opened up to it That period\nopened up other possibilities for bodies\nand for dance. New energies were\nreleased and artists were looking for\nways of incorporating the new information\ninto dancing.\nSo, in a work like Rough Cuts for\nexample, I was balancing bones, I was\nseeing how much I could free muscles\nto reflect emotions, to reflect thoughts\nso that they shimmered off the body,\noff the movement I felt these ideas\nand approaches to dance allowed for a\nmuch more complex relationship between\nthings, not simply a one-on-one,\nillustrative connection between movement,\nthought and emotion. The mind\nworks on all kinds of levels. I get\nlittle pleasure from dance which doesn’t\nacknowledge that complexity and\nsubtlety.\n\nDancing\n(1987)\n\nDEMPSTER: I am interested in your\nidea of training your dancers through\nrepertory. At the outset of the Dancing\nSara’s Phrases project you informed\nyour dancers that there wasn’t\nto be any training other than that\nimplicit in the learning of the dance.\nThis approach to the development of\ndance and dancers would seem to be\nfundamental to much of the work you\ndo. How do you see the relationship\nbetween your choreography, the work\nthat’s produced, and the training that\nyour dancers are undergoing?\n\nDUMAS: It’s a broad principle; it\nshouldn’t be taken to refer to a single\npiece. The idea is that the most effective\ntraining for a dancer is the production\nof work and that in the\nendeavour to get that work out the\ndancers are exposed to rigorous processes.\nI have a vested interest in\nmaking sure they understand what my\nintentions are. If they don’t understand\nthey can’t articulate the work,\ntheir bodies won’t have the resonance\nthat I am interested in. And yet they\ncan’t have my experiences, so it’s a\nmatter of communicating my understanding\nand encouraging them to find\nexperience akin to this in their own\nlives.\nOften when experience is codified\ninto a dance technique the sense of it\nbeing a lived experience is diminished.\nThe process of codification reduces the\nrichness of experience. It becomes a\nseries of muscular sets which speak\nprimarily of a certain kind of achievement\nand mastery. Other resonances,\nother meanings are excluded.\nDEMPSTER: When dancers come to\nwork with you either from a school or\nanother company situation where the\ndivision between technique and training,\nand rehearsal and performing is a\nmatter of convention and often quite\nrigidly made, they must find it confronting\nand confusing to work in this\nrather more open-ended and yet intensive\nway.\nDUMAS: Yes, I am asking them to see\ntheir lives implicated in the work. I\nask them to identify how they have\ncome to the information and beliefs\nthey have about the body and dance;\nwhat kind of culture has caused them\nto think that they have to stand a\nparticular way and not feel, for example.\nIf you ask people to start thinking\nfrom the body outwards and to have a\nsense of the spine—this is much more\na modem dance idea—you are asking\nthem to dance their bodies, rather than\nto parade on top of their well turned-\nout legs. To dance with a sense of the\nspine, to dance the body, you have to\nfeel with your body, and in order to\nfeel you come up against all sorts of\nsocial conditioning. This is especially\ntrue for men, who have been taught\nthat to show feeling is unmasculine.\nDEMPSTER: You have directed a number\nof large group performance projects,\nthe Mackie Project (1980) and\nDistinguishing Features (1983)\namongst them. These projects were\ndirected towards the education and\ntraining of dance artists and not the\ndevelopment of your own choreographic\nwork per se. What kinds of\nissues or problems were you hoping to\naddress through these programs?\nDUMAS: When I looked at dance here\n[in Australia] with its limitations and\nlack of development, I came to the\nconclusion that many of the problems\nwere the result of the training available\nto people. With the Mackie Project\nas well as giving people some\ninsights into choreographic process I\nwas trying to give experience which\nwould encourage dancers to know that\nthey have a value when they are not\ndancing. The way we learn to dance\nresults in the idea that you are only a\ndancer when you are dancing, that is,\nwhen you are doing steps. Who are\nyou when you’re not doing chasee pas\nde bouree? Your worth as a dancer is\nevaluated in terms of your ability to\ndo these technical things all the way\nthrough your training, and suddenly\nwhen you become a soloist or principal\nyou’re told that in fact it’s something\nelse. It’s always something else,\nbut that something else is never talked\nabout or specified and it is assumed\nthat this ‘something’ will just miraculously\nbe there when it’s required.\nBut the actual process of getting to the\npoint where you are required to exhibit\nthis ‘something else’ almost kills any\nconfidence that something else exists.\nYou have been undermined all the way\nthrough about your own worth as a\nperson, as a thinking person with\nopinions which have been physically\nwrought. In America I saw that people\nwere encouraged in their endeavour\nto be artists. What they thought\nand how they felt mattered because\nthat in effect was the substance of\ntheir art. As a dance artist, your body,\nyour mind is the filter for experience,\nand in America the individual is acknowledged\nas the centre, the source\nof the art.\nWith the Mackie Project I had also\nwanted to see whether American experience—the\nconcepts and techniques\nthat certain American artists had\nevolved to meet their culture—could\nbe transferred here and what the consequence\nof this would be. I finally\nconcluded that it wasn’t entirely useful\nin that it produced rather peculiar\naberrations in sensibility. People here\ndeveloped some facility and were able\nto refer to things—choreographic\nprocesses and concepts, new physical\nperceptions and skills—but without\nany real understanding of where these\nthings had come from, how they had\nevolved, what preceded them and\nwhere they might lead.\nOn Australian Experience\nand No P o in t s in Tim e (1988)\nDEMPSTER: What is your response to\nthe criticism that has been levelled at\nyou from time to time to the effect\nyour work is overly influenced by\nAmerican dance and is somehow ‘un-\nAustralian’ ?\nDUMAS: When I show work in New\nYork it is perceptibly different from\nthe work that is happening there and\nyet when I return to Australia the\nsame work is misconstrued as a mere\nborrowing of New York dance. The\nsuspicion is that because I’ve worked\nwith Twyla Tharp and Trisha Brown\nmy work is just some pale imitation of\ntheirs. To a New York audience it is\nabsolutely evident that this is not the\ncase; my past experience with those\ncompanies is not even commented\nupon. In Australia, with the absence\nof real reference points, the suspicion\nis always there.\n\nAustralian-ness, in the sense of\novert Australian content doesn’t surface\nin my work. But I’m not any less\n‘Australian’ for the fact that the questions\nI am asking are more subtle.\nThe Australian experience is not a\nsingular, homogeneous one.\nDEMPSTER: Critic Andrea Borsay has\ndescribed your recent work No Points\nin Time (1988) as ‘an eloquent statement\nof cultural displacement’. A\nconcern with questions of origin and\nliteracy has emerged as a fairly persistent\ntheme in our discussion today.\nIt would seem to suggest that your\ninterest in an examination of colonial\nexperience, of what it means to live\nand work as an artist in Australia, is\nneither new nor specific to No Points\nin Time, but has been an integral part\nof much of your choreographic exploration.\nSeen in this light your work\ncould be read as a cultural critique,\nan analysis of Australian experience.\nDUMAS: In a sense that is inevitable;\nthe dances reflect aspects of my life,\nof what has happened to me. It shows\nup as a symptom in the work I produce.\nDEMPSTER: Is it merely a symptom of\nyour condition, or Australia’s condition\nfor that matter? These questions\nhave been quite consciously tackled as\nissues in certain of your dances, and\nin my view your work does represent a\nquite thorough cultural analysis. Because\nAustralian society is not familiar\nwith the language you are using, the\nwork is not generally received and\ndiscussed in these terms.\nDUMAS: I might be tackling it, but it’s\nstill a symptom; I am still exhibiting\nsymptoms of cultural dislocation and\nisolation. There’s no way that I can\navoid manifesting that. The most\ninteresting thing for me is both to\nexhibit it and attempt to understand it.\nIn the endeavour to understand why I\nfeel this way, I understand something\nabout Australia, and about what it\nmeans to be an Australian and to live\nand work here.\nDEMPSTER: Tell me about the title No\nPoints in Time..\nDUMAS: I find the expression ‘at this\npoint in time’ rather silly—I don’t like\nit—so what I’m saying is that there\nare no points in time. My rejection of\nthat expression is also linked to the\nidea of another concept of time—the\nthought that Australia is the oldest\ncontinent. It is a land that is relatively\nunwritten in European terms; two hundred\nyears of European experience is\ninsignificant in a temporal sense.\nThe title was meant to evoke some\nof those things. There is also a bit of\na play around ipointes\\ It’s a rather\ntangential reference to a statement by\nDame Peggy van Praagh: “if it’s not\nen pointe it’s not real dance”—meaning,\nif it’s not ballet, it’s not worth\nconsidering.\nDEMPSTER: With the scrims, frames\nand projected images in No Points in\nTime, another sense of time is introduced\ninto the performance. What is\nthe relationship between these different\nelements—the live, the projected, the\npresent, the past, the static, the moving?\nDUMAS: The screens and projections\nwere partly to do with the idea of\nveneers, and of surface—something\nthat receives projections in both a\nliteral and figurative sense. When I\nwas a kid I went to the movies and\nmostly my access to art was through a\nvisual medium. We had a rather disembodied\nconnection to European and\nAmerican culture. My experience of\nart wasn’t to do with the spoken word\nbut with what was written and what\nwas represented visually, through\npictures, through the movies. This is\nhow things were communicated over\ndistance. What I was wanting to do\nwith the visual material was to echo\nthat kind of experience. Using projected\nimages to create a veneer, a\nfalse or transient sense of depth; the\nscrims suggest something that is superficial—present,\nbut not very solid.\nThe projections appeared at times to\ncreate depth but were shadowy, insubstantial.\nThis material was also a\nmetaphor for memory which can seem\nso substantial, so absolute, so sure and\nyet something can flicker and it changes\ndramatically.\nDEMPSTER: Elements from different\nperiods of your own history come into\nplay in this work. I recognise material\nfrom an early work, Blinky Bill\n(1978), enfolded into the long duet\nbetween yourself and Jo McKendry.\nDUMAS: I keep working material and it\ncycles through two or three or four\npieces, transformed and contextualised\ndifferently each time until it’s finally\ndropped out of the repertoire.\nCircular Quay pm )\nDEMPSTER: You once described the\nwork Circular Quay as a ploy. What\ndid you mean by that?\nDUMAS: The ploy is in the name; it\nwas partly an attempt to counter a\ntendency amongst critics who would\ncomment on seeing material reappear\nin my work. They’d see a movement\nphrase from one work in the next\nwork or maybe two years later and\nthere was this reaction: ‘oh we’ve seen\nthat movement before’. The movement\nwas distinctive and because it\nwas distinctive they’d recognise it,\nwhereas if it had been something from\nclassical ballet, it would be like tipping\na cup of water in the ocean.\nWhen a choreographer uses something\nlike ballet he might rearrange,\nmodify or cut it up, but there is not a\nsense of great personal investment in\nthe movement itself. There’s a notion\nthat a choreographer makes pieces like\nthis, by combining a given movement\nvocabulary with theatrical ideas and\nconcerns. But I am primarily concerned\nwith movement, not the things\nthat might surround it. I am interested\nin what movement itself means.\nDEMPSTER: Was there a problem\nstemming from the fact that modern\ndance is associated with innovation,\nwith the idea of ‘the new’, so that\nthere was an expectation that each\nwork you produced would feature lots\nof new movement content?\nDUMAS: It was a problem specific to\nAustralia. Other people working here\nwere not concerned with the development\nof movement material as such.\nThey were more concerned with dramatic\nor theatrical ideas or with the\nrelationship between movement and\nmusic. So that the projection for a\ncertain kind of innovation in movement\ncontent was all onto me. In the\ncritics’ eyes it was almost like an area\nthat I owned and therefore if I wasn’t\ncontinuing to develop and change and\ndelight every few months, well then\nsomehow I’d creatively dried up.\nI got irritated by the sense that\nwhat I was doing was always subjected\nto that expectation; that I would\nconstantly change, that each thing I\ndid would be different from anything\nelse I’d done, that what I was doing\ntwo months ago could somehow be\nradically unconnected from my present\nconcerns. So I thought I’d turn the\ntables and call all the work I produced\nthat year Circular Quay. I made two\nor three bodies of material which I\nshowed in different manifestations,\nranging from a trio to a large group\nwork for sixteen dancers.\nFor me, making work is about\nasking questions. Circular Quay\nwasn’t about invention of language so\nmuch as about using a language to ask\nquestions. What I was saying, basically,\nwas that I am an artist, I have\nintegrated concerns, the questions\ngiving rise to the present work come\nout of the past and out of other questions\nand other experience. I wanted\nto make the point that what I am doing\nhere is work. I’m not making\nseparate ‘pieces’; I’m not interested in\ndance in the typical narrative or mimetic\nform and I don’t set out to illustrate\nsome already known thing to an\naudience.\nDEMPSTER: But at what point does\nthat ongoing work become a ‘piece’,\nbecome presented as such?\nDUMAS: Almost retrospectively. They\nbecome fixed as pieces, and called\npieces because I make a video of\nthem, because they happen at eight\no’clock on a certain date.\nDEMPSTER: Some of your works have\nquite evocative and distinctive titles,\nwhich would seem to suggest that the\ndances are about specific subjects and\nthat your investigation is not purely a\nformal one.\nDUMAS: The titles are a way of reflecting\non and opening up other perspectives\nto the viewer. Some of the\ntitles are evocative but they do not\ndescribe the work. They are related to\nthe concerns that I’ve had during a\ngiven period; they circulate around\nthem.\nCircular Quay is a case in point\nCircular Quay, in Sydney, is a place of\ncontinuity and connection with European\nexperience. It was the place the\nfirst fleet landed; it was the place that\nocean liners came into and departed\nfrom. Quays generally are ports,\npoints of departure, places of comings\nand goings, places where there is\ninherent movement. I was also thinking\nabout the pervasiveness of ballet—the\nway that ballet had colonised\nAustralia and how it continues to\nconnect us to British and European\nexperience.\nDEMPSTER: So the title Circular Quay\nrefers to the character of that whole\nyear's work with its circulation of\nideas and materials, the comings and\ngoings of dancers and movement material.\nBeyond that it speaks of the\nplace of the ballet in Australian dance\nand in your own past—it’s a point of\ndeparture.\nTo represent the ballet as ‘quay’\nimplies connection and continuity, but\nparadoxically, it also suggests discontinuity,\nand dislocation from European\ncultural experience.\nDUMAS: Circular Quay is a play\naround all those themes.\nDEMPSTER: To return for a moment to\nthe question of recycling and reworking\nmaterial. The duet which concludes\nGiselle 2000 reappears two\nyears later in No Points in Time, and\nin this second context its meaning is\nmuch more diffuse, and ambiguous. In\nGiselle 2000 the duet can be read, if\none chooses to do so, as a comment\nupon the historical narrative—as a\ndeath at the hand of the Queen of The\nWilis, if you like. Whereas when it\noccurs in No Points in Time it is much\nless open to narrative interpretation.\nDUMAS: In a couple of pieces, I’ve used\nthis duet material which I’ve come to\ncall ‘post-modern death’. It is just two\nmen slowly descending into the floor.\nIt wasn’t intended to be illustrative of\ndeath per se. For me it was always a\nmuch more ambiguous, complex image.\nI saw it as a beautiful action in\nitself, and there is a kind of sensual\npleasure associated with it and an\nelement of voyeuristic pleasure. But it\ndoes also suggest death and decay.\n\nWhen I was younger I didn’t talk\nabout death. As a child there is that\nfear that your parents might die. You\ndon’t mention death because to do so\nseems to be playing some kind of\ngame with chance. If you don’t articulate\nit, it won’t happen, if you hold\nyour breath you can stop the sun moving\nbehind a cloud... There are these\nlittle fragments from an imaginative,\nmagic realm which remain with me.\nThey are not logical, not rational. In\nthe past I was not interested in illustrating\ndecay or death or even, for that\nmatter, the idea of beautiful...any of\nthose myths, if you like. Gradually I\nhave felt a shift whereby I now find it\nquite interesting to deal with those\n‘big narratives’. I don’t have an overwhelming\ndesire to deal with them, but\nthere’s no longer the feeling that they\ndon’t matter, or that they are foreign\nto me. They are relevant\nVenues and Audiences\nDEMPSTER: From the earliest days at\nthe Woolloomooloo Police Boys’ Club,\nDance Exchange’s concerts have been\npresented in unconventional venues\nsuch as gymnasiums, rehearsal studios,\ntown halls and such like. Unlike\nsome of your contemporaries you have\nnot made the move over to plusher,\nmore traditional theatre venues; you\ncontinue to present your work in informal,\nintimate and what might be\nthought of as rather marginal spaces.\nYour choice of performance venues\nmust be determined by financial considerations\nto a degree but I assume\nthat it is also an aesthetic choice on\nyour part?\nDUMAS: The whole notion of a ‘poor\ntheatre’ has been very influential and\nthe idea that ‘less is more’ always\nappealed to me. These kinds of spaces\ndo have their problems but in the final\nanalysis the structures that surround\nperformance do prescribe what can be\nsaid. When you come to a traditional\ntheatre the expectation of a particular\nkind of experience is already established\nthrough the architecture and\nambience of the building itself, with\nits foyers, box office, ushers and everything.\nIt becomes harder and harder\nto go outside the expectation that is\nset up by that kind of venue. Your\naudience in that situation is primed in\na particular way. Even if the work is\nattempting something different, if it’s\nput into that kind of package it’s already\ncoloured.\nDEMPSTER: Who is your audience?\nWho are you addressing?\nDUMAS: I’d say that there would be\nlimited interest in my work amongst\nthe general dance audience in Australia.\nI’m not sure that I could define\nwho my audience is, but I suspect it is\npeople who are more lively, who have\nmore questions of their culture. Often\nthat would mean an arts audience, a\nvisual arts audience, people more\ninterested in critical debate.\nOn Modernism and Post-\nModernism\nDEMPSTER: In your critical writing\nyou have noted that one of modern\ndance’s most significant contributions\nhas been to establish and promote the\nidea of the individual choreographic\nartist. You also state that the modern\ndance choreographer is concerned\nwith the development of an integrated\nmind/body expression; this expression\nis individual but also broadly written\nin the culture.\nTo represent the individual artist\nas origin, measure, and centre of the\nart of dance, would seem to be appropriate\nto the early moderns—certainly\nthey chose to represent themselves in\nthat way—but it wouldn’t seem to me\nto be quite accurate to continue to\nrepresent the art and individual artists\nin that way today. It’s a model which\nI associate with a particular era in\nmodern dance—that of Graham and\nHumphrey—and I don’t think later\nmoderns—Cunningham, for example—\nwould describe themselves in those\nterms.\nDUMAS: Partly when I say things\ncategorically like that it is in order to\nclarify a point, particularly in the\nAustralian context where the distinction\nbetween ballet and the art of the\nmodem dance choreographer has been\ninsufficiently understood. But I don’t\nreally subscribe to the notion of the\nunique, special individual, the individual\nartist as origin. It was the way the\nart was spoken of in the past and then\nit seemed to be much more a statement\nof the integrity of the artist, an\nintegrity which was perceived to be\nlinked to his or her uniqueness. Today\nwe have come to view these notions as\nmythological or distorting.\n56 Contact Quarterly\nDEMPSTER: Where do'you locate yourself\nwithin the modernist tradition in\ndance? Could the term post-modern\nbe usefully applied to your work?\nDUMAS: There are problems in using\nany term in an Australian context\nwhere we lack any real connection\nwith the social and historical circumstances\nfrom which they arose and to\nwhich they refer. Some of the concerns\nin some of the dances that I\nmake could be described as post-modernist,\nsome of them are not. But it’s\nnot really an issue for me.\nDEMPSTER: It is a label that is often\nattached, perhaps in some instances\nappropriately, to your work. And\ncertain of your choreographies especially\nthose involving a deconstruction\nof tradition—I’m thinking of Local\nMotion (1985) and Giselle 2000—do\nsit very much within post-modernist\ndebates.\nDUMAS: Partly what interests me at the\nmoment is working with an awareness\nof what is received, of what audience\nexpectations are of dance. But I’m\ninterested in shifting the ground rules\naround a bit, making gaps. In Giselle\n2000 for example, I wanted to make a\nwork that was very difficult for the\nperformer, that drew upon the stuff of\nthe classical duet, of classicism, but\nthat took it all slightly off, out of\nkilter. Because it has that inbuilt\ndiscomfort, the material is extremely\nhard. It’s never really possible to\nmaster and you can never really perform\nit with the authority it would\ntraditionally be invested with.\nWith processes and strategies of\ndeconstruction it’s necessary to have a\ncertain investment in the thing you are\ndenying. It’s partly that you have to\naffirm it, in a sense; you need to be\nable to speak the language of the\npractice you are questioning and reassessing\nin order to be comprehensible.\nDEMPSTER: Another aspect of postmodernist\ncompositional strategy\nwhich I’d like to discuss is the idea of\nbricolage—of collecting bits and pieces,\ndrawing materials from diverse\nsources and periods. A number of\nyour choreographies (Rough Cuts,\nLocal Motion, Giselle 2000) reveal\nsomething like a principle of bricolage\nat work in the selection and organisation\nof materials. However your work\ndoes not display the eclecticism and\ntendency towards pastiche which has\nbecome so predominant a feature in\nNew York post-modernism. In choreographing,\nas you have explained earlier\nin this interview, you do not begin\nwith a central idea or unifying theme\nfrom and around which materials are\ngenerated and structured. But there is\nan organic, kinaesthetic logic in your\ndancing and in performance which\ntends to modify any sense of structural\ndiscontinuity and fragmentation. The\nrigour of your rehearsal process—\nspecifically the detailed attention given\nto movement—brings about great\nclarity and purity in the movement and\nthis quality, ironically perhaps, given\nthe critics’ propensity to label your\nwork “post-modern,” gives a sense of\nunity and integration, and often rich\nemotional resonance to the work.\nDUMAS: I think that some artists—\nwhether it’s luck, intuition, whatever—pick\nparticular things for this\nprocess of bricolage which are resonant,\nwhich strike some chord with\nothers. It’s a question of the consciousness\nwith which the artist comes\nto the work—and I would not discredit\nthe notion of the unconscious artist by\nany means. It’s an intuitive thing.\nThe artist is of his time, what he is\ndoing is guided by a trust in intuition,\nwhich is not at all the same thing as\nsaying that he just took this, this and\nthis. There is something which predisposes\nthe choice.\nPerhaps having lived through this\nrange of different experiences I could\nmake very careful selections .of material\naccording to its ability to evoke\nother times and other places. Perhaps\nI might succeed in achieving some\nkind of resonance through this calculated\nbricolage. But I’d find that very\nmanipulative and the fact is I don’t\nknow exactly how the dances work; I\ndon’t presume to be able to do that\nconsciously.",

    "Abstract": "",
    "Content": "INTRODUCTION\nMovement improvisation is a form of research, a\nway of peering into the complex natural system that is a\nhuman being. It is, in a sense, another way of \"thinking,\"\nbut one that produces ideas impossible to conceive in stillness.\nImprovisation, as an avenue of inquiry, seems to be\nalmost entirely the domain of its practitioners. Almost no\none outside of our field has found it sufficiently interesting\nto make it the subject of scientific or philosophic study. Yet,\nin my opinion as both mover and writer, some of the questions\nposed by instantaneous physical composition are\nfundamental to our understanding of what it is to be human:\nWhat is \"consciousness\" when the body is in motion?\nWhat is the role of culture in our decision-making processes?\nHow much of what we do can be considered an act of\nwill? How can we both be open to and edit so many channels\nof information (psychological, aesthetic, kinesthetic, etc.)\nat the same time? How can the results of our creative\nlabors be both original and coherent?\nThe \"mind\" behind the moving (and by \"mind\" I mean\nan integrated \"body/mind\") is the pivotal issue for me.\nThat is why I was both pleased and intrigued by the report\nCQ, about their seminar in Amsterdam on \"Space, Movement,\nand Meaning.\" This event not only showed us a nondancing\ntheorist interested in movement improvisation, but\nan intense and fruitful dialogue that arose between idea,\nmovement manifestation of idea, and the dancer/theorist's\nexperiences of those moving ideas.\nMost exciting for me was the brief presentation, at the\nend of the article, of Schwarz's model for the mind during\nimprovisation. This model seemed to be based on three\nimages or concepts: the \"holographic\" brain; a \"fractal\nhierarchy\" of changes over time; and the role of cultural\nconditioning. I was deeply moved by these ideas because\nSchwarz, working independently in a different field, had\narrived at a description strikingly parallel to a model that I\nhad presented at last year's \"Symposium on Chaos Theory,\nQuantum Physics, and the Body in Motion\" at New York\nUniversity. This kind of simultaneity, and the fact that the\ndancers in Amsterdam found Schwarz's model in accordance\nwith their own experiences, gave me hope that one or\nboth of us had stumbled onto an organization of ideas that\ncould spur useful dialogue in the improvising community.\nIn that spirit I would like to present my model of the\nimprovising mind. I will try to balance my cumbersome\nreliance on the vocabulary and concepts of the \"New Physics\"\nwith some examples from my own awareness in moving\nthat provided a framework and direction for this work.\nI will also attempt to draw parallels to the concepts and\nterminology provided by Schwarz.\nFUNCTION FOLLOWS FORM\nIn his description of the \"holographic\" brain, Schwarz\ndiscusses the fact that a single holographic plate (or human\nmind) can hold \"hundreds of images\" at the same time, and\nthat every part of a hologram \"contains the whole image.\"\nThis is a more complex and multi-layered understanding of\nbrain function than existed in the past, and one that is now\nshared across a number of scientific disciplines, including\nmy own areas of interest, chaos theory and quantum theory.1\nFor me, theory and dancing come together in the following\nway. Sometimes, when I'm moving, I find my awareness\ntracking the changing movement patterns more than\nexperiencing the movements themselves. While this might\nsacrifice some of the immediacy of the dancing, it brings\ninto sharp focus the startling range and complexity of spontaneous\nhuman creativity. Our minds seem to be capable,\non demand, of creating, recognizing, and breaking an infinite\nnumber of patterns, anywhere on a spectrum from\nstrictly ordered to completely random.2 I believe (and, at\nthis stage of our understanding of the mind-body-brain\nrelationship, this is only speculation) that there is a structural\nfoundation for this skill.\nLike many, or even most, objects in nature, the human\nbody, including the brain and neural system, contains some\nlinear and some non-linear (particularly fractal) structures.3\nA fundamental tenet of my model of the improvising mind\nis that this structural dualism, linearity and non-linearity\nintegrated into the same space, creates a corresponding\ndualism of function: that at the same time in the same mind\nwe all have a propensity towards order and a propensity\ntowards chaos. The interaction of these opposing forces in\nthe mind can be elucidated by quantum theory.\nImprovisation can be thought of as a continuous series\nof minute creative acts, with each action arising from the\nimproviser's experience/physical structure and the conditions\ncreated by the improvisational choices that precede it.\nQuantum theory tells us that after each action there is a\nmoment, a place, a world where many choices for the next\nmovement simultaneously coexist. For example, if I was\nleaning far off-center, about to fall, my next \"decision\" (this\nis not necessarily a conscious decision) would be limited to\nall of the ways that I could accomplish the fall (would I roll\nthrough, rebound and reverse direction, allow my weight to\ncollapse? etc.). According to a quantum approach, the fact\nthat I eventually fall in only one way does not mean that\nmy mind is only presenting me with one choice. Instead,\nmy mind creates a potentially limitless number of simultaneous\n\"choices\" (computer program-like sets of neural\ninstructions) that cover the spectrum from order to chaos.\nIn quantum theory, the term for this acceptable coexistence\nof mutually exclusive possibilities is \"a coherent superposition\nof states.\"\nI find this idea to be more than just a theoretical construct\nbecause I have felt this effect in my body while dancing.\nSometimes, in the hyperawareness of improvisation,\nthere are microseconds of stillness between movements (a\nfeeling I might call \"hovering\") where I sense an actual\nmuscular tension that feels like my body wants to go in\nseveral directions. An instant later this tension resolves\nitself with a release into movement.\n\nCOLLAPSING THE WAVEFORM\nThe release into movement represents a \"decision\" by\nthe improvising mind. Although a full understanding of\nsuch a decision will probably remain forever beyond our\ngrasp, there are approaches that can hint at the underlying\nprocesses. Schwarz used the image of a \"fractal hierarchy\"\nto explain \"how the dancer passes from image to image\nlogically but unpredictably.\" The fractal idea is an apt one,\nparticularly the concept of bifurcation points4: the logic of\nchange stems from the acknowledgement that there is a\nhistory, a path, an existing pattern that brought the mover\nto this particular decision; the unpredictability arises from\nthe degree of possible bifurcation (how near or far from the\nexisting path will a new direction take us).\nQuantum theory provides an even clearer view of logical\nunpredictability. This approach states that we cannot\nknew, for a single occurrence, which choice among the multitude\nwill become a \"physical\" reality, but we can gain some\nunderstanding of the process by examining the probabilities\nof that event occurring.\nPicture, if you will, all of the possible choices hovering\nin this superposed world awaiting a conscious/unconscious\nsignal of some kind, an impetus to action that requires a\nresultant movement. Quantum theory would assign each\nchoice a quantum mechanical \"weight,\" which is an expression\nof the probability of a certain possibility occurring. If\nyou could somehow graph these probabilities, you would\ncreate a visual representation known as a \"waveform\" or\n\"wave function.\" Each time a possibility manifests as movement\nin the physical world, its probability becomes one\nhundred percent, and the probability of all other choices\nbecomes zero. This is called \"collapsing the waveform.\"\nFor an event where the choices are quite limited, this\napproach can create a very clear picture of what might\nhappen. For a phenomenon as complex as movement improvisation,\na clear picture is not possible. But that does not\nmean that this approach has nothing to offer. If we use one\naspect of improvisation, movement patterns, as an example,\nwe can see how the waveform, chaos/order, and the desires\nof the mover begin to converge.\nAn experienced improviser is aware (to varying degrees)\nof patterns created by his/her movements. These might be\npatterns of effort, patterns in space, patterns of focus, or\nmany others. But one thing they all have in common is that\nthe next movement performed will represent either a continuation,\na variation, or a breaking of the pattern. If it is the\n\"desire\" (whatever that may be) of the mover to continue\nthe pattern, the possibilities nearer to the order end of the\nchaos/order spectrum will be more heavily weighted, more\nlikely to be physicalized. If variation or discontinuation is\ndesired, weightedness will reside nearer to chaos.\nSo this loading of the improvisational dice, this boosting\nof particular curves in the waveform, is a reflection of a\ncertain kind of \"desire\" at the moment of decision. It could\nbe a completely conscious choice, or maybe an un-thought\nawareness that change is needed, or maybe just inherent\npatterns or \"habits\" of the mover. This is not at all clear.\nWhat is clear is that the kinds of desires that bias creative\ndecision-making do not occur in an aesthetic vacuum. They\nare a manifestation, a celebration, of who we are as individuals\nand social beings. To understand this we must incorporate\none last element into this mind model: culture.\n\nTHE CULTURAL PATINA\nAt first glance, the role of culture in improvisational\ncreativity could seem overwhelming. Not only does it\nshape the materials of art, in this case the movement choices,\nbut it plays an important role in concepts of form, and\neven in the types of \"desires\" an artist has during creation.\nIn his description of what he calls \"the cultural patina,\"\nSchwarz mentions \"ethnic traditions\" along with \"gestures,\ngaits, rites, and everyday routines.\" But despite the pervasiveness\nof these cultural influences, individuality, originality/\nis undeniable.\nCertainly, a major reason for this originality is personal\nhistory, which places each person within one or more cultures,\nyet separates him/her from any other individual. But\nI think there is more to it To explain my position, I would\nlike to shift the focus of the chaos/order spectrum slightly\neffect of chaos and order. The effect of chaos on the creative\nprocess would be \"something completely different or unexpected\"\nto that which came before. The effect of order, as I\nam conceiving it, would be something I term \"cultural\ncoherence.\"\nCultural coherence is the result of using the materials\nand rules of forming (the \"grammar,\" if you will) accepted\nand understood by a particular culture.5 If some form of\ncommunication, some transfer of \"meaning\" (I am using this\nin a very open-ended fashion) is desired, then the culture of\nthe intended receiver (even if it is yourself) must be consciously\nor unconsciously taken into account. The most\nobvious example is language, where an accepted set of\nsounds (phonemes) makes individual units of meaning\n(words) which can be combined in specific ways to make\nlarger units of meaning (phrases, sentences, etc). To change\nor manipulate any of the elements of language is to risk\nmiscommunication. The same issues apply to any medium,\nbe it visual, aural, or kinesthetic.\nI want to make it very clear, though, that cultural coherence\nis not an end in itself. If everyone relied only on what\nhad been passed down to them in the process of acculturation,\nthen culture, and our means of communicating within\nit, could never grow. If I, as an individual dance artist,\nwish to successfully communicate something, I must either\nlimit my art to that which is common to everyone in my\naudience, or I must use that commonality as a base from\nwhich the viewers can be enticed or dragged into the range\nof experiences unique to me and my work. That is why I\nthink cultural coherence must be constantly challenged;\nstretched but not broken. Integrating elements of chaos into\nthe cultural equation can provide the necessary stretch.\nThe final version of this model of the improvising mind,\nas shown in Diagram 2, necessitates a slight reconception of\nexisting ideas of creativity and originality. The ability to\nmake something new and different is apparently hard-wired\ninto all of us, so it can be seen as only a part of the creative\npuzzle. The next step, which might be called \"effective\noriginality,\" demands that we find some balance between\nwhat is new and what is familiar, between chaos and cultural\ncoherence, so that we can open a passage between the life\nof the dancer and the lives of others who experience the\ndance.\n\nSO WHAT?\nIt is easy to question the sense or necessity of developing\nelaborate models to explain processes which exist and\ncontinue quite oblivious to our intellectual gropings. Thinking\nabout these ideas might not change the way we move,\nbut moving with these ideas might just change the way we\nthink. I know that I set out on these thought journeys\nseeking the same thing I search for in improvisation: connections.\nWe can see chaos all around us and then find it in\nourselves. We can recognize that the quantum processes\nwhich control the atoms in the wooden floor on which we\nstand, control the atoms in our own hands and feet. After\nfour centuries of pseudo-objectivity, science is finally trying\nto help us find the through-line, playing a cosmic game of\n\"Where's Waldo?\" to see where humans are hiding in our\npicture of the universe.",

The decision by the organizers\ncame about because a woman participant\nof the Jam announced that her\ntrust and body had been violated by\nthis man in an unwanted sexual manner\nat the end of a massage.\nSubsequently, at the 1993 A Cap-\npella Motion Workshop two women\ncame forward saying that similar incidents\nhad occurred to them with this\nsame man, during A Cappella Motion\nof the previous summer. All three of\nthese women are filing formal complaints\nwith a National Grievance\nCommittee and the Health Department/\nMassage Therapist Registry in the\nstate where this man operates a massage\nschool.\nI propose that we need to remind\npeople at workshops and jams that we\nare creating unique and temporary\ncommunities for the duration of the\nevent. These gatherings generally\n1\nphoto: Ka Rustler\nsupport an environment for one’s\nbody/mind to open, learn, change and\ndance with self and others. These\nactivities often engender a sense of\ntrust with fellow participants. The\nreminder is that as unique and as nurturing\nas the community may feel at\nthe time, we are still part of the real\nworld.

Over the years these courses\nhave included the styles of Merce\nCunningham, Martha Graham, and\nIsadora Duncan. When the department\nfirst approached me, they said that they\nwere finally entering the twentieth\ncentury and would like someone to\nteach Contact Improvisation. Some of\nthe school’s instructors had been lobbying\nfor Contact Improvisation classes,\nand because we were celebrating the\ntwentieth anniversary of the inception of\nthe form, they felt it qualified for the\n“Heritage” component of this particular\ncourse.\nIn my thirteen years of teaching, I\nhave been accustomed to students who\nwere somehow familiar with the form;\nthey had seen a performance, or had\ndanced with friends, or had taken contact\nclasses. When I entered the Roble\nDance Studio at Stanford, with a class\nof 23 students, only five had heard of\nthe form and only three had ever seen\nit. I had the unexpected realization that\nI was in a position to be gently subversive.\nBecause of this unusual situation,\nI taught a series that did not follow my\nusual style and format. I kept the\nstudents out of any continuous physical\ncontact for nine classes. It was like\nextended foreplay. By the time they\nstarted working in duets, they had built\na strong desire for the dance. Once the\nclass started dancing, that was all they\nwanted to do in each of the afternoon\nmeetings.\nAt Stanford, students receive one\nunit for dance classes, except in the\nDance Heritage series, where they are\nawarded three units. For the extra units\nthey are expected to fulfill reading,\nwriting and dancing components of the\ncourse. For this series a journal was\nrequired. The dance critic Janice Ross,\nwho taught the historical content of the\ncourse, wrote the following description\nfor the class syllabus:\nThe journal is an account of\nyour thoughts and responses to\nContact Improvisation, an artifact\nof your on-going relationship\nto this material. Be aware\nhow these ideas are affected by\nclass, readings, discussions.\nThe journal is also something of\nthe reverse: a record of the way\nlife imprints itself upon your\nunderstanding of this project\nthrough other performances, art\nevents, daily life. Feel free to\ndevelop a written format that\nsuits you. Be honest. Have\nserious fun. The completed\njournal will constitute your\nwritten final for the class.\nIt was a pleasure and an honor to\nteach this group of receptive and articulate\nstudents. Below are excerpts from\nthe students’ journals, chosen for their\nuntainted view, their insight, and some\nfor their poetry.\nJOURNAL EXCERPTS:\nHow am I supposed to dance, when\nmy country [India] is being torn to\nshreds? It is a live naked body, with\nfeet tied to the rack, genitalia tearing\nslowly. I burn, am in pain, am Sadist,\nand Masochist in one. Riots, Burnings,\nMy Parents, Friends In The Midst, My\nBeing torn as it stretches across Miles to\nthe other end of the earth. And yet I do\ndance, rehearse, and I am proud of\nmyself.\nI am particularly interested in the\nsurfaces which we are urged to find.\nBone, muscle=planes—I am building a\nsort of heat-sensitive-geographic-map\nimage of the shapes created by the body\nin motion. An arm is ultimately narrow\nand stick-like, but at the right moment\nwith a person spiraling over it, its support\ncan be like a sweeping field.\nI felt a kind of awareness I don’t\nthink I ever experienced before. It’s not\ncerebral at all—it’s much more wholly\nawake. It’s a daze and an intense\nawareness at once.\nThe pleasure of touch between people,\nwhen we usually can only touch in\nhighly formalized ways. To be able to\nslide and slither and wend and wiggle,\nskin to skin, weight to weight: a visceral,\nunnameable pleasure. When I walk out\nof the studio, my relaxed touch is limited\nto those I am particularly close to; but\nwithin, this touch is everywhere between\nnear strangers as well as close friends.\nLearning about their personality from\nhow they use their touch in the dance.\nAnd outside of the studio, those I know\nfrom contact I feel so much more comfortable\nwith, feeling we know each\nother in these nameless visceral ways.\nI really like the moments in the\ndance where my expectations fail: where\nI expect to go “whoosh” and go “clunk”\ninstead; I’m not sure why these moments\nare so appealing to me, but they are.\n1 was holding someone my size in my\narms! As a woman, I find this new\nfound strength very exciting. I have a\nstrong dance background in ballet and I\ndid a lot of advanced partner work so\nI’m used to being lifted. I still like, or\nrather love to jump, fly, and spin, but\nnow I realize that I can return the favor!\nI’m no longer intending this class to\nbe psychotherapy or anything, but I\ncame to studio in a foul mood—felt\nphysically unwell and was really quite\nnumb—depressingly so. Left class really\nhappy, in no frivolous way, but quietly\nand profoundly.\nIt was interesting how do-able some\nof this work is. In the lift where one\nperson cartwheels onto the other’s\nshoulder, my partner and I spent about\nthree minutes just being scared. Then\nfinally we tried it and it was such a\nrelief. It was not only reasonable to do,\nbut fun.\nThe advanced stepping-stepping over\nthe other person in a continuous motion—smoothly\nintroducing weight so\nthat weight is moving horizontally rather\nthan coming down. Then a revelation:\nfervently, madly I started dashing from\none prone individual to another stepping\non all of them. Suddenly, everyone\nbegan running around and shifting between\nbeing prone and stepped on and\nthe scene erupted into spontaneous pandemonium.\nMartin put into my dance the image\nof a moonless Sierra Night Sky at 10,000\nfeet. It’s a cold frosty evening. I have\nspent many hours lying in my sleeping\nbag staring at the canopy of stars, the\ncold air rushing at my face, sometimes a\ngentle breeze tos lowly caress the trees,\nor the stark mountain crags of bare-\nedged rock ridges. There’s a sense of\npeace, mixed with a feeling of tension,\nas if something is about to happen. Perhaps\na meteorite, or a satellite silently\nmoving between the constellations. The\nstars seem so bright and clear by themselves.\nThat’s what I think of the image.\nRisks heights fall crashing bumping\ngliding fluttering it is so wonderful to be\nyoung and invincible to be filled with the\npower of song & feeling in awe of my\ndream in awe of gravity.\nBecause of my general stress level I\nseem to have an easier time with the\nblatantly expressive stuff and a harder\ntime with the more subtle stuff.\nBlame your partner—yes—this is\neasy to do, and I’m guilty of it. It takes\na lot of energy and inquiry to work with\na person that I feel isn’t present—but it\nis about the relationship with the person\nyou are with at that moment and how\neach person comes to that dance at that\nmoment.\n“Over:”\nfinished—it’s over\npower—she’s over you\ncycle—over and over and over again\nlet go—get over it\nDo you, projected reader, have certain\nwords which, separate from the\nthings they signify, simply grate on your\nears, sound like an offense to the human\ntongue?? One such word for me is\n“luxuriate.” The concept is fine, great,\nnecessary, but God the sound of the\nword bothers me. Two words which appeal\nto me, unlike luxuriate, are “sultry”\nand “mango.”\n\nThere are some people I like dancing\nwith more than others. Some l feel are\nmore attuned to exploring together, to\ndiscovering what's new in each new\npartnering. Others feel to me to desire\nto cling to their own agenda, a more\ndemanding stance, more one-way, less\ntwo-way. I care less about partners who\ngrab, who take my limbs and yank this\nway or that, go here, go there, do this,\ndo that. I can see their intentions of\nmaking this dance work; but I want to\nwork for both of us, to work of both of\nus, to work out of both of us.\nThe gift of resistance—the dynamics\nmade possible by giving resistance to\nsomeone else’s weight or energy (as\nopposed to support). Both experiences\nteach me a lot. Moments when action or\nbalanced stillness grows from the two\nforces countering each other to create a\nthird direction are specially exciting\nphysically and meaningful to me metaphorically.\nHow can the leader tell the difference\nbetween active/unconscious resistance\nand physical limits of anatomy?\nWhen should resistance be coaxed away,\nwhen is resistance an absolute physical\nlimit (i.e. knees only bend one way),\nwhen is resistance natural/unconscious\nprotection?\nTomorrow & tomorrow & tomorrow\nis but another day for sorrow & joy &\npain & life & shame but today today is\nthe sun’s birthday and all the days too\nas long as they are today today I will\nraise my feet to the sky today I will fall\nto the floor & today I will make my own\ndream with the sunken treasure of my\nown body this & that I will lift lift lift\nout of lazy nothingness and find the\ncorners that even scare lovers\nMy heart is as\na thousand cranes\nin flight...\neach time I do\na cartwheel +",

    "Content": "are in the contact group in Burlington,\nVermont, are pregnant at the same time.\nBeing pregnant at the same time has\nallowed us to share experiences and\nlearn about ourselves and each other in\nnew ways. As you can imagine, this\nsort of “pregnancy presence” has also\nhad an impact on the entire group.\nFor me, contacting has evolved and\nchanged as I have moved through the\nstages of pregnancy. At first I felt\nprotective and slow in my movement.\nI was always tired and my dancing\nshowed my fatigue. Now in my 24th\nweek, I feel energetic and imagine\nmyself moving as I always have moved\nwhen I wasn’t pregnant. This contradiction\nof feeling as though it’s easier to\nmove, take weight, and roll over my\nbelly as it enlarges, not only surprised\nme, but has required that I explain\nmyself to the people with whom I\ndance. Since it’s difficult to have great\nobjectivity regarding one’s own inspiration\nto move, I could only say that I\nmove my body in ways that feel good,\nnatural, and within my range. Sound\nfamiliar?\nI don’t think of myself as having a\nhandicap nor do I have a ferocious\ndesire to dance even though I’m pregnant!\nIn fact, with my last pregnancy,\nI stopped contacting because I pulled a\nligament during a lift.\nDuring this pregnancy, lifting hasn’t\nbeen a problem for me. I believe I am\nlifting differently than when I injured\nmyself during the last pregnancy. Now\nI am lifting by slightly bending at the\nwaist and knees, and carrying my\npartner on my back. I can also engage\nin short lifts through space when I am\nmoving with the momentum of the other\nperson. I had injured myself in the last\npregnancy by “muscling” my partner up\ninto a lift and subsequently straining\nuterine ligaments.\nBesides lifting in specific ways, I’ve\nalso been conscientious about rolling\nwith the enlarged uterus and baby. I\nhave found that I do this in two ways,\ndepending on the situation. The first\nway that I was able to allow myself to\ntake weight was to relax my abdominal\nmuscles and let the other person sink\ninto, and roll past, my body. I used\nthis same technique for rolling over\nothers. Sound familiar? The main\ndifference doing this while pregnant is\nthat you really have to trust yourself\nthat it’s OK and it won’t hurt the baby.\nThe second technique I found to roll\nthrough moves with an enlarging uterus\nis quite different from the first In fact,\nit is the opposite! I tighten my abdominal\nmuscles on occasion when I’m\nfeeling I need to protect myself. I believe\nthis usually happens when I’m not\nexpecting the weight of my partner or\nthe baby is in a position that is uncomfortable\nfor me.\nThe problem I’ve encountered most\nrecently while contacting is that other\npeople are afraid of hurting the baby.\nNobody can prevent me from giving\nweight, but it’s really difficult to reassure\npeople that it’s alright for them to\ngive their weight to me! Who is disabling\nwho? I believe the ultimate\nresolve is to trust that whether a person\nis pregnant or not pregnant, that each\nperson contacting is responsible for\nthemselves. Thus, we return to the idea\nI first expressed—when pregnant I move\nin “ways that feel good, natural, and\nwithin my range.”\nAside from the physical joy of moving\nwhile pregnant, I feel that contact\nimprovisation has helped me to bond\nwith the baby. One experience of recognizing\nthe baby in a new way was\nwhen I was contacting and felt my\npartner’s elbows. It occurred to me that\nit was very much like the feeling of the\nbaby moving inside of me. Somehow\nmaking this connection—“oh, that’s\nwhat the baby is doing”—helped me to\nfeel closer to the baby.\nBonding to the baby and adjusting\nto one’s own body image while pregnant\ncan also be very humorous. My\nfriend Jayne is pregnant and we had the\nfunniest contact dance—a playful improvisation\nabout playing basketball with\nour bellies. Others in the group were\nhaving fun with this image too, providing\nbasketball hoops with their arms for\nus to jump into! Dancing while pregnant\ncan be fun for everyone.\nIn conclusion, I would like to encourage\nwomen who are pregnant to\nkeep dancing. There is so much to be\ngained from this experience. It may\nseem awkward at times and movement\nmay feel slow and lethargic too, but you\nwill learn to move in ways that are new\nand right for your own changing body.\nIt is a time of change and exploration\nfor everyone in your dance group.\nContacters who dance with pregnant\nwomen are also learning to move in\ndifferent ways.\nWhat is there to gain by contacting\nwhile pregnant? The pregnant woman\ndoing contact gains freedom to explore\nand expand movement options at a time\nwhen most pregnant women limit and\ndecrease movement options. By expanding\nmovement options, the pregnant\nwoman is likely to have fewer backaches\nand swelling. Greater comfort in\npregnancy occurs by exercising muscles\nwhich support the back and uterus and\nThe psychological benefits of contacting\nwhile pregnant include enhanced\nself/body image, increased bonding time\nwith the baby, and continued socialization\nduring pregnancy. It also enhances\ngreater understanding about pregnancy\nbeen pregnant ★",

    "Content": "The sun was setting; it was getting late.\nHe walked her to the garden gate.\nHe wanted to thank her, but he didn’t know how.\n’Cause he was the farmer, and she was the cow.\n6th grade autograph book inscription\n“Opposition is true friendship.”\nWilliam Blake\n\nIt was by chance that I happened to see Israel’s Prime\nMinister Yitzhak Rabin and P.L.O. Chairman Yassir Arafat\nshake hands on the White House lawn last September. I\nwas stopping home midday and flicked the tv on for a\nquick weather report and found, instead, the ceremony\nabout to begin. I stood, then sat, spellbound, watching\ntheir movements: every shift of weight, turn of head,\ndirection of gaze, the reach, hesitation, grasp, shaking it,\nthe hand, firmly, finally, and letting it go. When the ceremony\nwas over, I cried, feeling slightly embarrassed,\nslightly proud, and surprised at the force of my reaction.\nI think what moved me most was the movement and\nhow it spoke of what was inside it. As much as the teams\nof experts tried to choreograph this handshake—having\nClinton step back and open his arms, leaving the space in\nfront of him empty, a powerful vacuum into which the\nmagic handshake might (be made to) suddenly appear—it\nwasn’t going to be that easy. Though diplomats, skilled in\nthe art of shake and smile, these two men were, for a long\nmoment, much more than political symbols, and their\nmovements couldn’t hide the enormous personal investment,\nthe hope, reservation, courage, pride, fear and discipline\nthat brought them all the way to the touch of each\nother’s hands.\nWhen I went into the studio up in Vermont last year for\na ‘visit’ with my friend Simone Forti, a dancer whose work\nI respect and enjoy, I wasn’t sure what would happen. All\nI knew was what I had asked for: that the two of us be in\nthe space together, working alone on whatever was most\ncompelling for us at the time, and that we wouldn’t, unless\nirresistibly drawn to it, interact with each other directly.\nI began moving as I had been for some months, slowly,\ndeeply, on the floor, finding my way through a satisfying\nterrain of micro-stretches and weight releases, full of feeling,\nsensation and image—private, personal—when I began\nto hear Simone warming up. She was light on her feet,\nmoving this way and that, sometimes going to the floor,\nthen hopping up, talking in a high animated voice: “Yes,\nyes, I really did like that book... It really is a good book,”\netc. As she continued her work, I began to feel increasingly\nuncomfortable, irritated, bothered. I can’t relate to this,\nI thought to myself. I don’t want to relate to this. And\nthen I realized I didn’t exactly have to. I had made the\nrules and the rules said to stay with what I was doing, not\nworry about meeting or trying to adapt to the other. The\npoint was not to try to block out her presence, but to accept\nand appreciate it while continuing on my own way. This\nmakes its own kind of relationship. After twenty years of\nmeeting partners through Contact Improvisation, I find this\nkind of meeting extraordinary, a tremendous relief and a\ndemanding discipline.\n\nSo I continued, aware and not aware of Simone’s\nwhereabouts, following the thread of my sensation further\nthrough the maze of images that it provoked. An hour or\nso later, I noticed that we were very close to each other in\nthe room, she still on her feet dancing and talking, me\nmoving slowly on the floor. At that moment I experienced\nus in the same image—she as a dehydrated woman dancing\nlightly through the desert telling her tale, and I, below, was\nthe desert under her feet—geologically slow, compressed\nlayers of time and earth, moving imperceptibly out in all\ndirections, going nowhere. I had arrived at our meeting.\nPerhaps what really moved me in the Rabin-Arafat\nhandshake was realizing that their extreme differences\nwould not be dissolved by the touch of their hands. That\nthey would remain fiercely opposed and at the same time\ndeeply united. I hope to support this stance in my own\nwork and life within the dance community. How can we\nshare in the creation and development of work—the collective\nwork and the particular works; how do we, as individuals,\nstand alone with our experience, and how do we shift\nin and out of synch with our peers without losing contact?\nHow can we respect the integrity of the individual’s contribution\nand at the same time share freely in the collective\nbounty of the work?",

    "Abstract": "",
    "Content": "(1960-1993)\n\nIt's cold here in Minneapolis on the last day of January\n1994. It's warm in the whirlpool at the Best Western where I\nhave visions of Arthur gracing the over-chlorinated air and\nwater with his playful strut and acrobatics back in May of\n1987. I was dancing with Arthur that week as a member of\nSusan Marshall and Co. In one dance, Trio in Four Parts, we\nwere buddies, both restless, Arthur the leader, I the loyal side-\nkick. Five years before, Susan, Arthur and I had met at the\nThe Yard, on Martha's Vineyard, and our lives were profoundly\nchanged forever. Now almost seven years after the first\nMinneapolis trip, I've returned to the Best Western after\nhaving completed performances in collaboration with my dear\nfriend Dan Froot, creations that speak of two men mourning\nthe loss of loved ones, that cry out at the unjust God-like\nauthorities at large, and that hopefully give us and others the\nstrength to go on without those loved ones.\nAnd go on we do, but it's a difficult task. I write this now\nto celebrate the life of Arthur Armijo, one of the most gifted\ndancers of our generation and one of my most inspiring\nfriends.\nArthur Armijo was bom on July 13, 1960 in New Mexico\nand died August 8, 1993 in New York City with his family\nand members of Susan Marshall and Co. at his side. In the\nbrief 33 years between these events, Arthur exuded potent\ndoses of quiet charisma, wonderfully mischievous abandon,\nunparalleled poetic beauty on stage, and a humor and\nunlimited wisdom and generosity as a friend such that most\nof us will continue to measure our world by him I will miss\nhis wondrous touch on the back of my neck, and the sound of\nhis large-scale snoring on tour in our hotel room as he would\ndrift into sleep. Just this week I saw him: diving crazily into\nthe pool; in a play, acting and dancing the lead role; and as I\nstared into the mirror attempting a paltry imitation of him\nmoving his long, uncannily flexible arms, as only Arthur\ncould.\nThe day after Arthur died, I traveled to Jacob's Pillow in\nMassachusetts to collaborate with another Yard friend, Victoria\nMarks, on a project to be shown on the Pillow's Inside/Out\nstage. Each night that Victoria and I spoke with those who\ncame to see our in-process creation, I told the story of returning\nhome from the hospital the night Arthur died, not being\nable to imagine how I would sleep that night, arise the next\nday, drive to an idyllic setting and begin a piece of art. Then,\nday after day, with the help of Victoria and the talented\nperformers with whom we worked, we all began to find ways\nof expressing our sorrow and our joy, combining these two\nemotions to assert Arthur and ourselves in the world.\nArthur continues to grace our lives in many ways. As I\nwas driving downtown in Manhattan, after a dinner with\nArthur's family the night before his memorial tribute in\nDecember, I tuned into a radio interview with director Wim\nWenders. Wenders's film, Wings of Desire, was one of Arthur's\nfavorites and one that had influenced Arthur's own choreography.\nThe interviewer asked Wenders why he felt a need to\nmake a sequel to Wings of Desire. He replied that the world\nwas different now. The Wall had come down, people had\nchanged, his angels had changed—there was even a new\nangel, a woman. The interview caused me to realize how\ndrastically our world had changed on August 8,1993, and that\nthere is yet another very special angel looking over us all.\nThank you, Arthur.",

    "Content": "The Urban Nature project is, in\nessence, research about the relationship\nof humankind-in-the-’90s to our immediate\nenvironment. The research is of\nan experiential nature. Through physical\nand spiritual experience, participants\nof the project discover possible ways of\nbehavior in different environments.\nAlthough my partner Jaana Turunen\nand I have worked (and lived) for many\nyears in rural areas, it wasn’t until 1991\nthat I figured how interesting it could be\nto subject the ‘laws of nature’ to the\n‘laws of the city’. What happens when\nmy senses are as alert, my reflexes as\nreactive and my state of mind as open\nand direct in the noise of an urban\nsituation as they are in the nature?\nBetween the summers of ’91 and\n’92, I collected three dancers besides\nJaana and myself, two musicians, one\nvisual artist, one writer, one photographer\nand a small television crew. We\nworked for four weeks, as the ‘urban\nnature tribe’ at the beautiful location of\na former shamanic ritual offering site in\nFinnish Lapland. There is a small lake,\nset in low mountains with a thirty-meter\nwaterfall.\nThe main aim of this project was to\nfind out what would happen to us and\nour reactions in an urban environment\nafter we’d been for four weeks in those\nmountains in the nature with our senses\nalert and open. The resulting 1992\nperformances took place at the Zoo of\nKorkeasaari, in Helsinki, Finland. The\nperformance space was in the outside\ncage of a just renovated monkey house.\nBefore us, there was first a lion, then an\nice bear, then us and now baboons live\nthere.\nResearch environments are always\nnatural. Believing that true life-force is\nrooted in and created from the organic\nearth, it is necessary for the continuation\nof creative development to understand\nand redefine our connections to the\nwilderness within ourselves. This\ninvolves a process of sensing, relating,\nexploring and finally through form and\nstructure, experiencing the workings of\nintelligence.\nWe are looking for collaborators\nnow on the Urban Nature project.\nParticipants can be: dancers, physical-\noriented actors, visual artists, musicians,\nwriters, thinkers, technicians, architects.\nNot necessarily all of these will participate\nat the same time nor all of the\ntime. Natural environments we might\nexplore can be: dry hot deserts, arctic\nice, desolate nordic border areas (Lap-\nland); hot jungles, high mountains, sea\nshores, lake districts, etc.\nThe information will be collected in\na natural environment, mainly in an\ninstinctive and sensory way. Exploration\nof the information will happen in\nboth natural and ‘artificial’ environments;\nthe process of exploration is\nphysical, sensory, emotional, informal,\nand ritualistic. The final performance\nwill be a manifestation of an integration\nof the previous experiences within a\nconceptualized frame. The performing\nenvironment will be at least partly arti- ,\nficial. Performances can be done at:\ntunnels, factory halls, in mine-shafts,\ndead end streets, etc.\nThe next Urban Nature projects i\npossibly will happen in Austria, summer\n1994, and New Mexico, summer 1995.\nIf you are interested to know more\nabout this work, or would like to participate,\nor if you know of interesting\nlocations, please call or write me.

      "Nancy Topf"
    ],
    "Abstract": "",
    "Content": "JOHN ROLLAND, 43, died on\nDecember 16,1993 in Amsterdam. He\nwas an important figure in the development\nof Release and Alignment Technique,\nan exploration which he and I\nsltared for twenty-five years. This technique\nincluded ideokinesis (mind/body\nintegration), the use of hands-on bodywork\nand improvisation in teaching\ndance. This is my testimony and tribute\nto John's life and work.\nI met John in 1968 when he\nwas a student at the University of Illinois.\nJohn was in a class in which I\nwas teaching dance through the Cunningham\ntechnique, with a traditional\nmethod of training where students\nimitate the actions and shapes of the\nteacher. During a class early in the\nterm, John was wiggling his head on\nhis spine, a movement that made him\nstand out from the other students since\nthe class usually began in stillness with\nthe body standing erect and feet in\nparallel position. I asked John what he\nwas doing and he replied, 'I'm feeling\nmy head balancing on my spine.\" Witnessing\nhis movement, and hearing his\nuse of the word \"feeling\" combined\nwith the anatomical language, created\na pivotal moment in my direction as a\nteacher.\nFor several years before this time,\nMarsha Paludan and Joan Skinner had\nbeen exploring these concepts as teachers\nat the University. Neither Joan nor\nMarsha were at the University the year\nI arrived, but John conveyed his excitement\nabout this work to me and we\nbegan an intense ongoing dialogue\nexploring these concepts and questioning\ntraditional methods of training the\nbeen involved with this work at the\nUniversity, impacted greatly on these\nearly explorations.\nSubsequently, but at different\ntimes, John, Marsha, Mary and I became\nstudents of Barbara Clark, who\nhad herself been a student of Mabel\nTodd, author of The Thinking Body.1 It\nwas Barbara's work that helped to define\na theoretical and technical foundation\nfor much of our own research.\nIn 1972 I joined John and Marsha\nfor the summer in Lawrence, Kansas.\n(John had already spent the two previous\nsummers in Lawrence, which was\nMarsha's home.) I read The Thinking\nBody for the first time. Marsha was\ndoing creative work with children,\ninspired by her work with Barbara\nClark. We joined her in these projects\nand also spent time in a studio where\nwe laid on the floor, yawned, crept,\ncrawled and explored the developmental\npath.\nBack in New York, I continued\nexploring this movement with my\nstudents at Lehman College, although\nthe physical education administration\npreferred more traditional methods.\nDuring this period Mary was based at\nthe University of Rochester where she\nwas developing her work and had\ninvited John to join her there.\nIn 1973, Mary moved to England\nand continued developing the release\nwork at Dartington College in Devon.\nJohn, Marsha, and myself were often\ninvited as guest teachers.\nIn 1976, Marsha, John and I established\na workshop that became known\nas the Vermont Movement Workshop,\nwhich lasted for twelve years. The\npurpose of the workshop was to provide\nan environment that would give\nus freedom to further develop these\npedagogical explorations and to intensify\nour dialogue. We established a\ncurriculum that included Todd alignment\nwork, release technique, contact\nimprovisation, and a composition class\ncalled \"Structures for Improvisation.\"\nEach summer we invited additional\nfaculty to share in the teaching. There\nwere few places at that time for such\nexperimental work with students.\nDuring this period, \"release\" referred\nto an ideokinetic (mind/body)\nmethod of movement training in which\nanatomical images from the alignment\nwork we had been developing were\nexplored in movement improvisations\nthrough a deep meditative process.\nAnatomical images are pictures of\nthe skeleton combined with lines of\ndirection that instruct the body towards\nits most efficient use in relation\nto gravity, weight and momentum. [See\ninset from John's book, Inside Motion.]\nThe developmental movement path\n(rolling, crawling, rising/falling, standing,\nwalking, i.e., the path the baby\ntakes to become vertical) was used as\nthe basic structure from which the\nimprovisations developed. The images\nnot only heightened anatomical and\nalignment awareness in the student,\nbut also inspired the creation of dances.\nThe anatomical images would\ntransform into personal 'landscapes'\nbut always could be traced back to an\nanatomical source.\nJohn taught the alignment class and\nshared the teaching of the release classes\nwith Marsha and myself. In teaching,\nJohn conveyed his clear and precise\nunderstanding of the body. His\nclass was technically sound and beautifully\norganized, and my body easily\ninternalized the information. John was\na very gifted and inspiring teacher! He\nknew how things were put together; he\nunderstood structure; and the progression\nof his classes was extremely logical.\nIn contrast to my earlier teaching\nmethods related to the Cunningham\ntechnique, \"release\" technique provided\nstudents with the means to find their\nown form, action and direction, motivated\nand rooted in the experience and\nknowledge gained from the anatomical\nimages. This experience emphasized\nan awareness of the skeletal structure.\nIn 1981 John was invited to become\na member of the teaching staff at the\nModem Dance Department of the State\nTheaterschool in Amsterdam.2 The\nschool administrators were delighted\nwith John's innovative method of\nteaching that freed dance training from\nstylistic limitations yet still conveyed\nbasic technical knowledge. John\nbrought this new educational model to\nthe Theaterschool, an exciting and\nsupportive place for this movement\nresearch and one of the few institutions\nin the world that sponsored this pioneering\nwork. This was due to the\nfoundation laid by Pauline de Groot\nand nourished by the intense interest of\nAat Hougee and Jaap Flier.\nThey also encouraged John during\nthe writing of his book Inside Motion.3\nJohn has said that writing this book\nwas the most difficult thing he had\never done. It describes the \"essential\nanatomical principles\" (outlined in\nMabel Todd's work) in a manner that is\nunderstandable and easy to apply.\nJohn's drawings clearly illustrate these\nessential ideas. It is an excellent workbook.\nJohn wanted to share his beloved\nAmsterdam with Marsha and I and he\nencouraged the school to invite us as\nguest teachers. I became a regular\nguest teacher and had the opportunity\nto witness John in the prime of his\nteaching.\nJohn's creative ability and his capacity\nfor analyzing and understanding\ninterior structure manifested in many\nother aspects of his life. Teacher, dancer,\nchoreographer, and writer, John was\nalso a clothes designer, builder, furniture\nmaker and interior designer.\nAmong the many things John created\nwas a dress for me to make it easier to\nnurse my baby. The dress had red and\nblue flowers and a lace-trimmed zipper\nin the front. Also a potter, John's early\npots looked like spines.\nJohn's mother and father were both\nhighly regarded musicians and teachers.\nJohn, himself, was an accomplished\npianist. When he finally\nbought a piano for his flat in Amsterdam,\nit was his way of saying that\nAmsterdam would be his home. While\nit was initially difficult for him to give\nup his native culture, John uncovered\nstrong European roots and often travelled\nto Budapest to visit relatives. He\nloved Bartok.\nJohn was a gifted visual artist and\na fantastic cook. If he saw a food bargain\nin the market he would buy\nenough for the Russian army and use\nit to invent new variations of traditional\ndishes. These concoctions were always\ndelicious and healthy. John loved\nhaving dinner parties and always took\ngreat care of his friends. He shared his\nlove of cooking with Raoul Anderson\nand Lene Gravesen, the cooks at the\nschool. In fact, for the memorial service,\nthey prepared a feast of all of\nJohn's favorite dishes.\nJohn lived the last six and a half\nyears knowing that he was HIV positive\nwith the support of his loving and\ndevoted partner Ron Veeninga. They\nshared a mutual interest and talent as\npainters. They also shared daily bike\nrides in the Vondelpark.\nJohn became very involved in\nlearning about AIDS. Ron has said\nthat John learned so much about AIDS\nthat sometimes in the hospital the\ndoctors would ask him questions. He\nbecame very involved in his own emotional\ndevelopment through work with\nan AIDS organization and began to\nspeak of the importance of emotional\nwork in the training of the dancer.\nThrough teaching guest workshops, he\nshared these new-found tools with\nstudents at the Theaterschool.\nIn closing, I would like to share a\npoem by Marianne Moore that I saw\non the inside of a New York subway\ncar. The poem caught my attention\nwhile I was on my way to pick up my\nticket to Amsterdam John was very ill\nand I was struggling with the realization\nthat this would be the last time I\nwould see him\nWHAT ARE YEARS?\nWhat is our innocence,\nwhat is our guUt? All are\nnaked, none are safe. And whence\nis courage: the unanswered question,\nthe resolute doubt,—\ndumbly calling, deeply listening—that\nin misfortune, even death,\nencourages others\nand in its defeat, stirs\nthe soul to be strong? He\nsees deep and is glad, who\naccedes to mortality\nand in his imprisonment rises\nupon himself as\nthe sea in a chasm, struggling to be\nfree and unable to be\nin its surrendering\nfinds its continuing.\nSo he who strongly feels,\nbehaves. The very bird,\ngrown taller as he sings, steels\nhis form straight up. Though he is captive,\nhis mighty singing\nsays, satisfaction is a lowly\nthing, how pure a thing is joy.\nThis is mortality,\nthis is eternity.\nMarianne Moore\nJohn will always remain with me. I\nspeak of him and his brilliant, clear\nwork whenever I teach. I am grateful\nfor having experienced his incredibly\ncreative and inspiring life, his wisdom\nand his friendship. I hope through\ncontinuing our work I can honor his\nlife, express my devotion and celebrate\nhis memory.",

    "Content": "About eight months before John Rolland, my friend\nand partner in life, died I watched an interesting program\non Dutch television called, \"Artists and Death.\" It showed\nhow different artists were dealing with dying and death, a\nsubject that I had become quite interested in as both John\nand I knew that one day he would die due to the incurable\ndisease he suffered from.\nIn spite of the fact that I'd lost many loved ones before, I\ndidn't really know about death. I was somehow kept away\nfrom it as a child by my parents, and later on in life, people\nthat were close to me died in faraway places.\nJohn and I had talked about his death quite often, and it\nfelt okay, meaning that for the first time in my life I was\nable to give it a special place in my mind. I understood that\nit didn't have to be negative or scary.\nThe only thing that didn't make sense to me was that\nfunerals and cremations all looked alike, no matter how\ndifferent the people were while they were still alive. Seeing\n\"Artists and Death,\" I learned that I wasn't the only one\nwho was thinking this way. The program showed that\nslowly, slowly, people are becoming aware of their need to\ndo things \"not the average way\" when they die.\nThere was a painter on the program who said that she\ndidn't want to lie down in a casket that \"did not belong to\nher,\" so she decided to have one made, and painted it the\nway she liked. When it was finished, she stored it away\nand sometimes looked at it, knowing that it was alright\nnow. It gave her a good feeling to know that shen she died,\nshe would end up in a casket that she felt connected to.\nThe program gave me strength. I decided too that when\nJohn would die, I would do the utmost to make his funeral\nas personal as possible. I felt the need to be involved one\nhundred percent, and didn't like the idea of strangers making\nchoices for us.\nI actually got very excited about it, and told John about\nthe idea. His answer was, \"You do whatever you think is\ngood. What's good to you is good to me.\" After every\ndance performance we had seen together, we would spend\nhours discussing how it affected us, its strengths and weaknesses,\nespecially in its structure and use of time, and how\nthat supported feeling. So he could be confident that whatever\nI choreographed for his funeral would reflect his values.\nThere was a funeral director on the tv program who\nexplained that people could decide a lot more for themselves\nbut they simply didn't know that because most funeral\ndirectors don't want to be bothered with this approach.\nAfter all, it's big business. The more organized glitter, the\nmore money they make. So why tell people about other\npossibilities?\n\nI decided to get in touch with this funeral director, Ina\nde Pauw, and invite her to our house, and I drew up a plan.\nThis was about seven weeks before John's death. I somehow\nfelt the time had come to start organizing it all, despite\nJohn's telling me that he knew he was going to die during\nthe spring, still months away.\nIna appeared to be a very nice, straightforward woman\nwho knew her business. She asked me what the funeral\nshould be like, and I told her that we wanted it to be simple\nbut personal. She let me explain what I thought was simple,\nand I was surprised by her response that my wishes were\nrather unusual. Ina wrote everything down and then at the\nend said it was going to be just beautiful.\nOpening a catalog showing different shaped caskets, Ina\nasked me to make a choice. In fact I didn't like any of\nthem, although the cheapest one was not offensive. I ran to\nthe bedroom (John was already so ill that he stayed in bed\nmost of the time) and showed him He said, \"It's fine. At\nleast it7s simple!\" I asked him that night if it bothered him,\nconfronting him with his own funeral like this. Again he\nreassured me that everything I decided felt good to him.\nHis death was not a shadow of gloom to hide from, but a\npart of life, a reality that we could deal with creatively. We\nalways had this understanding together. So visualizing the\nceremony became a source of creative satisfaction for him\nduring his last painful weeks. For example, when I proposed\na section in which everyone would place a candle on\nthe coffin, he would excitedly describe the scene to close\nfriends who came to visit.\n\nI had the strong feeling that people should be given time\nduring the ceremony to go through emotions. I suggested\nwe rent the crematorium for a full hour instead of the standard\nhalf hour. (Many cremation ceremonies, I learned, last\nonly 17 minutes!) Also, I had been to cremations and funerals\nwhere the casket stayed in plain view, rather than descending\nthrough the floor, to spare people the emotional\nscene of witnessing the final departure. Why be afraid of\npowerful feelings? We should all get up from our seats and\nparticipate in that moment, hold hands in a circle around\nthe casket as it lowers. John agreed with me absolutely.\nWhen that moment finally came, weeks later, it gave us all a\npowerful, living image of ourselves as a community embrac\ning the life and death of one we all loved; that death need\nnot be an occasion to feel the breaking of bonds, but the\nstrengthening of them\nOne day I called Ina and told her that the casket had to\nbe dark cobalt blue, with black handles. I told John about it\nand he asked me to show him the color-chart. \"Oh,\" he\nsaid, \"that's a nice color!\" That same night he asked\nJacques van Eijden, who was visiting us, to show him the\nchart again. He double checked it and again gave his assent.\nNone of us could have known that John would die the\nnext morning. It was Thursday, the 16th of December, 1993\nat 10:10 in the morning.\nThe day of John's cremation and memorial service was\nthe 21st of December. It had been raining all week long, bu!\non the 21st it was nice weather and there was even some\nsunshine.\nPeople entered the crematorium while piano music by\nRachmaninov (Prdudes, Op. 32, Nrs. 5-13) was being played\ngave an introduction, followed by a speech by one of John's\nfriends, and a beautiful poem by Jacques van Eijden.\nBecause one of John's dearest friends, Nancy Topf, had\ncome all the way from New York to be with us, I chose a\npiece composed by her husband, Jon Gibson, to be heard\nduring the candle ceremony. It was Extensions II, a piece\nJohn liked very much. Everyone lit a candle, placing it\neither on the casket, or next to it. After this, Ria Higler, one\nof the directors of the School for New Dance Development\nwhere John had taught for many years, spoke, explaining\nhow much John had meant to her and to the school.\nAfter Ria spoke, we listened to a tape of John playing\nthree Bartok piano pieces, Mikrokosmos #138. It was very\nemotional. John was a very talented pianist, and both his\nparents were professional musicians. I loved his piano play\ning, and often begged him to play those three Bartok pieces\nfor me. He performed them with a superb sense of rhythm\nand so authentically, perhaps because of his own Hungarian\nbackground.\nThen it was my turn to speak. I wanted to let people\nknow that in a short time John and I had lived a very full\nlife together. We both felt that we were not going to give\nin, but fight to the very end. We were determined to live\nhappily, no matter what the future would bring us. A\nperson who can live such a long time knowing that there is\nno cure for his disease, yet nevertheless maintain such a\npositive outlook on life, is a true hero.\nWhen it was time to say good-bye to him, a beautifully\nmoving Kaddish was played, sung by Ofra Haza, one of our\nfavorite Israeli singers, while we held hands around John's\n5 cobalt blue casket covered with our flickering candles. As\nthe casket slowly descended to the song, a current of emotion\npassed through the circle, shaking us with trembling\nand quiet tears. It was hard to believe that the ceremony\nwas over now. People were reluctant to leave, watching the\nempty space where moments before had been John's material\npresence.\ni Eventually people moved away from the hall while a\nnocturne by John Field played. This was the last piece of\nmusic John had been able to play on his piano before his\nlegs refused to cooperate.\nJohn had one strong wish concerning his funeral. He\ntold me several times that he wanted a memorial service at\nthe dance school, to be held in Studio 3.1, which had originally\nbeen a chapel at the top of the building. He also\nmentioned that there should be a lot of good food, and an\nopportunity for everyone who wanted to, to say something.\nGood friends of John's, Raoul Anderson and Lene Graveson,\nprepared it all: humus, \"Gehakte Leber\" (chicken liver pate),\nfalafel, and many other tasty things they knew John liked to\neat.\nThe cremation-funeral was held between 11:30 am and\n12:30 pm. The gathering at the school started at 1:30. As\npeople entered with piano music playing, they were invited\nto start eating and drinking. An hour later, we began a\nspecial ceremony.\nJohn and I had participated in a couple of AIDS workshops.\nThese workshops—titled, \"Homecoming: Living and\nLetting Go with HIV and AIDS\"—use insights from Elisabeth\nKubler-Ross, and a Gestalt technique further developed\nOne of the ceremonies she led at the end of a five-day\nworkshop was to pick a flower from a big bouquet and say\nwhat you \"left\" at the workshop, and what you \"take home\nwith you.\" I had talked with Rochelle about using this\nflower ritual for John's memorial service, giving people a\nstructure through which to express their feelings. There was\na big bunch of red and dark blue anemones, one of John's\nfavorite flowers. It was one of the most meaningful ceremonies\nI've ever witnessed. John was remembered in so many\ndifferent ways. There was so much love and warmth\naround.\nAt the very end we played a piece of music that John\nalways liked very much. It's an Israeli song, called \"Hallelujah.\"\nEveryone spontaneously joined hands in a circle\nand danced and sang along. After the song, we raised a\ntoast to life, \"L'chaim.\" John would have liked that.\nOn the 10th of January we buried John's ashes in our\ncommunal grave at Zorgvlied Cemetary, along the Amstel\nRiver in Amsterdam.\nJohn had started out as a painter and ceramicist before\nbecoming a dancer. Years later, when John decided to paint\nagain, I realized I had never met anyone whose work so\nclosely connected to my own. Now that John is gone, looking\nat the paintings, ceramics, self-made furniture, woolen\nsweaters, clothes, etc. he made and left to me, I feel that not\nonly have I lost the most beautiful man I've known in my\nlife, but also the most talented, my favorite art soul-mate.\nI'll miss discussing my paintings with him, but as he once\ntold me, \"I'll always be there, looking over your shoulder,\nand support you whenever I can.\"\nJohn, to me you are and were the most beautiful man in\nthe world.",

    "Authors": [

    ],
    "Abstract": "",
    "Content": "The field\nIn the late spring of 1993, 1 was a guest “Theory”\nteacher at the European Dance Development Center\n(EDDC) in Arnhem, Holland.\n“Theory” being too broad a concept to serve as a\nguideline, I decided to organize the three weeks of the\nworkshop as a shared exploration with the students of\nseveral perspectives on how we could approach dance that\nis being made today. My concern was to give the EDDC\ndance students some basic concepts from the fields of cultural\nanthropology, semiotics and psychoanalysis and to try\nto use those models to help us talk, write, and understand\nthe aesthetics and politics of contemporary dance.1\nOne of my unstated objectives throughout the course\nwas to try to avoid what seems to me a strange paradox\npervading dance theory. For some reason, and with some\nrare and noble exceptions,2 there is a strange discomfort\namongst academia in dealing with dance outside the frame\nof historical perspective and a reluctance to look for a\nmore complex interpretive frame that can illuminate contemporary\nchoreography. Whether this predominance of\nHistory in dance research comes from an attempt to dignify\nan art form by acknowledging its aging (always a respectable\npredicament, the one of being old) or from the enormous\ntheoretical difficulties that semiotics and other disciplines\nhave in dealing with non-textual art forms, the result\nis nevertheless a strange paradox—an art that needs living\nbodies to exist is projected, as a research object, to an\nintangible past. It is as if we needed the veil of death in\norder to face the essence of dance. (Or is this veil a symptom\nthat something unbearable may lie at the core of\ndance?)\nWith all this in mind, the students and I dealt basically\nwith two major thematic areas: firstly, an introduction to\ngeneral concepts and methods coming from the Anthropology\nof the Symbolic and their possible applications to a\ndecoding of choreographic construction; and secondly, a\nbroad discussion on the politics surrounding the issues of\ndance creation and the circulation of dance in the market\nHere a special focus was put on the role of journalistic\ndance criticism as an essential part of that market\nI wanted the students to understand that if we are to see\ndance as a cultural object not only do we have to acknowledge\nand study the work of choreographers, dancers, composers,\ndesigners and all the artistic staff that put then-\ncreativity together to make a choreographic object, but also\nand necessarily we must include in our analysis those indispensable\ncounterparts of the creative process in a capitalistic\nsystem of production, the entire web that lives for\nand because of Dance: critics, journalists, curators and producers.\nMy point was to bring some awareness to how this\nbroad community functions in a dynamic way continuously\nshaping and reshaping (consciously and/or unconsciously)\nthe definitions of what dance is or should be. This constant\nreshaping of aesthetic values plays an essential part in\nthe construction of desire, frustration and validation that\nkeep the dance market running.\nA salad of references\nWhat I wanted to bring to the EDDC workshop was a\npolitical and critical approach to the issues and practices\nsurrounding the making, producing and writing of dance—\nparticularly, and this is important, of journalistic writing of\ndance. I wanted to transmit to the students the critical\ntradition typical of my field of knowledge—Cultural Anthropology.\nThe main reference I brought to the workshop was the\niconoclastic precepts of a discipline known broadly as\n“Critical Theory.” Dwight Conquergood, from the Department\nof Performance Studies at Northwestern University,\nalthough acknowledging the lack of a unitary concept for\nthe field of Critical Theory, defines it as being “.. .committed\nto unveiling the political stakes that anchor cultural\npractices—research and scholarly practices no less than\nthe everyday\" and concludes “Yes, critical theory politicizes\nscience and knowledge.\"3 My inclusion of aesthetics\nand criticism in this process of politicization is only a\nlogical extension of Conquergood’s definition: “Critical\ntheorists.. .are committed to the excavation of the political\nunderpinnings of all modes of representation, including the\nscientific.”4\nInto this excavation and politicization, I tossed an inter-\ntextual salad of three critics of criticism in the three disciplines\nof Performance Studies, Ethnography, and Dance\nTheory: Dwight Conquergood, anthropologist James Clifford5\nand scholar Noel Carroll.6\nEach of these authors proposes either a transformation\nof writing for the purpose of a better way of describing and\nanalyzing either “ethnographic” or “aesthetic” objects or, in\nthe case of Conquergood, a non-textual, performative approach\nto analysis.\nTo Conquergood, non-writing is seen as an alternative\nfor academic papers as a method of analysis. In his article\n“Rethinking Ethnography...” he proposes that rethinking\nthe “world as performance” opens up several possibilities\nfor ethnographic analysis, namely for Performance and\nInterpretation: “What kinds of knowledge are privileged or\ndisplaced when performed experience becomes a way of\nknowing, a method of critical inquiry, a mode of understanding?\n...What are the range and varieties of performance\nmodes and styles that can enable interpretation and\nunderstanding?” and for Performance and Scholarly Representation:\n“What are the rhetorical problematics of performance\nas a complementary or alternative form of ‘publishing’\nresearch?”. Truth and textuality are not necessarily\nsynonyms. This cannot be overemphasized.\nJames Clifford gave us a very useful model of historical\nchanges of the idea of beauty in western art and art\ntheory. His archeological study on the validation of nonwestern\n(“primitive”) objects by European artists and critics\nin the early decades of this century, shows how the evaluation\nof this art as “exotic” is an ideological construct aimed\nat a specific site in the market: the critical discourse. (This\nissue is very much present in European dance festivals\nnowadays that seem to always require the presence of that\nexotic.) His essays also show how both “content” and\n“form” are ideological constructs.7\nNoel Carroll’s “situational criticism,” based in philosopher\nKarl Popper’s model of a logic of the situation, claims\nthat “...dance is also a human activity; and to make someone\nunderstand a dance or a choreographic style one\nneeds to make clear the logic of the situation in which the\ndance was created or the choreography developed.”\nWith all these references in mind, I proposed to the\nstudents a framework.8 The following were the points we\nstarted from in trying to create alternative forms of criticism:\nTo say that a work of art has a content is an animistic\nprojection—or reification. Things don’t have “contents.”\nMeaning exists because humans exist. When\nwe are interpreting a work of art, what we are really\ndoing is interpreting an intersection of cultural and\nindividual definitions (the artist’s and the critic’s) of\nwhat art is. Criticism should be a discourse on these\nintersections. This is seldom recognized by journalistic\ndance criticism.\nThe first premise has as direct consequence the inclusion\nof a multiplicity of levels of analysis in any interpretation\nof a work of art. Any discourse or interpretive\nmodel is partial. All we have are different discourses\nthat can help us shed light on different aspects\nof the piece. In this sense a Marxist, or a psychoanalytical,\nor a semiotic interpretation partially illuminates\nbut never encompasses the wholeness of the work. In\nthis sense a dance also never is. This has been the\ncommon sense of semiotics for at least thirty years but\nsomehow the verb to be is still a tyrant in dance criticism.\n(Someone’s dance is this or is that.)\nThe first two premises lead to the importance of acknowledging\nthat there is a Self behind the lines of the\nreview. I would argue that part of the logic of the\nsituation in dance criticism is to make that Self explicit\nto the reader. The acknowledging of this presence adds\nperformativity (presence and the acknowledging of\npresence) to the text and dissolves the figure of authority\nin the abstraction of the words. (During the workshop\nwe talked about these issues illustrating them with\nJames Clifford’s articles on the politics of ethnographic\ntexts.)\nFollowing the ideas of performativity we explored\nDwight Conquergood’s proposition of performance as\nan alternative to ethnographic field notes and kept in\nmind that maybe text is not always an adequate medium\nto express precisely a certain idea. Other levels of\ntextuality were explored.\nWe kept in mind how Gregory Bateson showed that\ndescription is fundamental but always short of the\nobject described.9\nWe followed Noel Carroll’s proposition that the role of\nthe critic would be to clarify the logic of the dance for\nthe reader by pointing to and explaining the choreographer’s\nchoices in view of her or his intentions. My\nattraction to Carroll’s model derives mainly from the\nweight all the elements of a dance assume under this\nperspective and the degree of awareness it requires to\ninclude choreographic details that transcend movement—from\nlighting and costumes to the casting of\ndancers.\n• The choreographic analysis that the students and I did\nthroughout the course tried to identify and interpret\nthose choices, seeing them as potentially meaningful.\nMy only discomfort with Carroll’s theory lies in its\nintellectual spring: the rationalistic body of knowledge\nof Popper which seems to abhor any suggestion of an\nunconscious life.10 A life that we intently looked for in\nthe interpretation of choreographies.\n• We kept in mind that at a certain level the choreographer\nexpresses unconscious or symbolic material. We\nlooked for those materials as structuring choreographies\nand tried to add them into the analysis.\n• We kept in mind that there is a capitalistic market\nbehind the dance reviewed. The critic is part of that\nmarket. The critic should make that relation explicit.\nSome politics\nA polemics in the U.S. still seems to revolve around\nthe issues of “descriptive” versus “interpretive” criticism.11\nDuring the workshop, students and I agreed that there is no\npoint in developing serious criticism if one is not grounded\nin the observed material; but also, through the analysis of\nseveral American dance critics’ writings, we agreed that\npure description is always short of the object and tiring to\nthe reader; on the other hand, delirious interpretation does\nnot even get to the object and manages to be quite irritating\nfor the reader.\nMy opinion is that at this moment a revision of criticism\nneeds to leave these common-sensical discussions and\nregain some political momentum: journalistic critics don’t\nseem to be worrying very much about the question of\ncriticism in a capitalistic market of art and its role of selfempowerment.\nIf there was a reason for experimenting\nwith critique in the workshop at EDDC, it was political.\nDance criticism is still judgmental in a very bourgeois way.\nAs Spanish playwright and critic Antonio Lera would say,\noften the critic likes to play a role more fit for the Pope\nBut the point is that the making of judgments is a\nnecessary motor in the politics of frustration and desiremaking,\nboth essential for the production and circulation of\nchoreographies. And it is here that the inclusion of per-\nformativity in writing can be a crucial way of reshaping the\ncritic’s use of words.\nDoubt as gift\nI believe that one of the political consequences of\nperformative writing and criticism as performance (and of\nthe workshop at the EDDC) is the inclusion of uncertainty\nthrough acknowledging in the writing the existence of the\nephemeral in both the dance and in the writing on the\ndance. The double presence of Self and of doubt seems to\nme particularly relevant and politically important. Per-\nformativity in writing diminishes the authoritarian voice of\nthe text, as Dwight Conquergood would say, “The performance\nparadigm is an alternative to the atemporal, decon-\ntextualized, flattening approach of text-positivism.”\nBut this inclusion of doubt in reviews can be quite\nproblematic; for newspapers want “news” that is “true”\n(whatever that means ideologically). So we also have to\nleave out of criticism the information on anthropological\nconstructs, fantasmatic12 contents, social and political issues\nor constraints embedded in the piece reviewed. This exclusion\nperpetuates the ideology of physical virtuosity, the\nuncritical definition of beauty, and phraseologies such as\n“gorgeous bodies,” “witty composition” and so on, totally\nremoved from social and intellectual constructs.\nThe discomfort experienced by my own editors—\nalways willing, I have to say, to allow for quite a wide\nrange of writing approaches—was very clear when, for the\nfirst time in four years of journalism (from literary criticism,\nto scientific journalism, to dance reviewing), I had\n'some texts on dance refused. For me, this not only locates\nthe role of art journalism in the system of aesthetic and\ncapital value production but made me think for the first\ntime who I was really writing to when writing about dance.\nIt made me see that I was, first, writing for the journalistic\ncommunity in the run for factuality and “truth;” and then,\nto producers and choreographers eager to accumulate voluminous\npress-packages about their products for the sake of\nsale and circulation. And it made me see that, through the\ntextual making and destruction of objects of desire, criticism\nembodies in its writing the complex relations between\nartist, producer, critic and capital in establishing the aesthetic\n(and therefore commercial) value of the work of art.\n\nA trip to the field\nAs a corollary of the workshop I wanted the students to\nexperience the dreads of professional journalistic dance\ncriticism. Fortunately, the Springdance Festival in Utrecht\n[Holland], the epitome of the European dance festival, was\nhappening at the time.13 So we went on a field trip: four\nperformances in a seven hour marathon and after that, three\ndays to show up with a result. The assignment was that\nthe students would have to create a critical discourse—that\nis, a reflective insight on what they saw. The form of that\ndiscourse would have to be harmonious with their own\nmental processes, in a language they would feel at ease\nwith (verbal, pictorial, non-verbal, etc.). A final rule was\nthat “impressionistic” texts would be considered a failure in\nthe task. Again, I was experimenting in interpretation (or,\nto use the jargon, in “hermeneutics”) not in impressionism.\nA few of the results are on the following pages. Some of\nthe students decided to stay inside the boundaries of written\ndiscourse. Among these, some would complement the\ntypical essay form with a more open, poetic form. None of\nthe students responded with movement which I considered\na wise decision. Again, all impressionism was out of the\nquestion and to respond critically to a performance through\nanother performance would imply to create a whole new\nchoreography (a valid option of analysis according to\nConquergood’s models), something they wouldn’t have the\ntime to do.\nSo what?\nThere is a Portuguese saying that claims that hell is full\nof good intentions. I do feel that at this point the complexity\nof the questions raised by performative writing and by\nperformative criticism are but touched on in the students’\nand my own attempts to bring a different shape to the\nrationalistic hierarchy of Truth=Word/Untruth=Body. But\nif criticism is ideology, then to provoke in the students a\nresponsible response to that predicament is already to happily\ndeserve my own share of hell.\nActually, in this hierarchy, truthfulness (which is not\nthe same as “truth”) does not necessarily have to relate to\nthe means of discourse (body or words) but to the semantics\nof that discourse. Not to words per se but to a certain\nway of using words. To conclude, I would like to make\nclear that the issue shouldn’t be to “fight” words or to\n“distrust” words, but to be aware of both the limits of\nlanguage and of the political weight given to textual discourse\nin academia and in criticism. A weight that, when\ntyrannic, makes the world of expression and intellection\nsmaller. What I do distrust are mental cages where words’\nmagical weight are used in order to perpetuate an ideology\nof art production and its aesthetic, political and economic\npremises. In the case of European dance, a sometimes\nabsurd system of production and circulation is literally\nembedded in linguistic irresponsibility, usually in the texts\nthat festival programmers and curators write to justify their\naesthetic and market choices of what to present and to\nexclude.\nThe heavenly part of all this is that one week after the\nEDDC course my letter of resignation was at my editor’s\ndesk. Now I feel free to write (or to non-write) about\ndance.",

    "Content": "This is the February 1994 draft of\nan ongoing writing that was inspired\nAndre Lepecki in April 1993 at the\nCenter for New Dance Development in\nArnhem, Netherlands (now the European\nDance Development Center).\n\nI am standing in the doorway\nof a studio. The late afternoon sun\ncolors the room warm yellow. On the\nfloor some people are moving together\nin a slow sliding manner. Their bodies\ncontribute to a large lump of moving\nlimbs. Many eyes are closed, and\nwhen open they don’t look at each\nother. Wooden floorboards whistle\nwhen naked feet rub against them.\nMovement is controlled just enough to\navoid another body’s private parts.\nSatisfied sighs happen when one body\ntakes the weight of another. A blend\nof assorted body odours float in the\nair, fill up my nose in spite of the open\nwindow in the back. The activity\nperformed in front of me seems aimless,\nnameless. An undefined, unpersonalized\nfigure of flesh. Something is\nmissing, something else is too insisting.\nI leave and walk away.\nSome years ago, desperate to find\nan artistic expression, I dived into an\nexperimental dance community in\nHolland, and became a student of the\nCenter for New Dance Development\n(CNDO) in Arnhem. I spent four\nyears inside this world, one of the\nmost claustrophobic experiences of my\nlife. I felt I was part of a protective,\ntight group of people, unaware of the\n“outside world.” I used to think there\nwas something wrong with me not\nbeing able to enjoy watching contact\nimprovisation or other experimental\ndance* performances. I was told that\nif I could open up and trust, that\nwould be my cure. I fought my resistance\nand struggled to forget my first\nresponses.\nEventually I succeeded in “understanding”\nthe movement language.\nSuddenly everything I saw gave meaning\nto me. All I needed to do was\nswitch on my fantasy button. I realized\nthat everyone else in the dance\ncommunity was doing the same thing.\nThey put on miracle glasses through\nwhich everything looked wonderfully\nmeaningful.\nBut the magic did not last for me.\nMaybe I got the wrong type of miraclt\nglasses. Maybe they broke while I\nwas dancing. Maybe I got tired of\nseeing my own fantasies. According\nto my sense of justice, I could not\ncontinue to look for certain dance\nperformance ingredients and ignore\nothers. I could not make myself see\nthe way I was suggested to, and that\ngot me into a lot of trouble.\nI educated myself as an experimental\ndance performer. I wanted to\nlearn skills so that I could communicate\nwith people through performance\nWhat I discovered was that I don’t\nbelieve in experimental dance as a\nmedium of communication. It is\ncrucial to me to investigate why, and\nwhat makes me doubt experimental\ndance as performance.\nI believe that a performer’s intention\nis to communicate with other\npeople, the audience. Likewise, I\npresume that an audience member attends\na performance out of a curiosity\nabout whatever “message” the performer\nhas to give. In a performance\nsituation, both audience and performer\ncontribute to the creation of communication\nlines between them. This exchange\nis the performance. The per7\nformer invites the audience to perceive\nand receive her message. The audience\nagrees to the offer and gives the\nperformer time and trust. This agreement\ngives the performer an active\nand powerful position. The audience\nallows the performer to take them\ntowards something unknown. For\nmost people, meeting with the unknown\nhas a fearful curiosity to it.\nWhenever fear is involved, there is\ndanger of fight and rejection. But\nthere is also a chance for exchange\nand acceptance of the unknown. This\nmeeting between known and unknown\ncreates the dynamic of the performance\nsituation.\nThere are many examples of audiences\nof experimental dance refusing\nto take this art expression seriously.\nHow often have I heard from audience\nmembers, “I could have done it myself,”\nor “I didn’t get it.” This is the\nreaction of somebody who feels\nfooled. I believe that in most cases\nwhen an audience reacts with rejection,\nthe performer has not been able\nto project her message well enough.\nThe communication lines have not\nbeen developed, the exchange has not\nhappened.\nIn the experimental dance community\nI find myself in, a negative response\nfrom the audience is often not\nrespected. It is seen as an ignorant\nargument from someone who is not\nwilling to understand. Rejection is\nmet with rejection and “war” is the\noutcome. I am sure there are audience\nmembers who are unable to meet the\nunfamiliar, but I think they must be in\nthe minority. I refuse to believe that\npeople are so self-destructive that they\nspend money and time to be bored.\nOf course, a performer may intend to\nprovoke her audience to reject a performance.\nThat is a conscious choice\nI can accept.\nIn my opinion, today’s performers\nare learning to be self-respecting artists,\nnot only serving puppets for demanding\naudiences. However, I am\nseeing that performers are indulging in\nthis position. Rather than using the\npower of the performer’s role to relate\nand communicate with audiences, I see\nperformers being self-absorbed on\nstage. Today’s perspective on the\naudience, or lack of it, has developed\ninto a symptom I choose to call “audience\ndenial.” In suffering from audience\ndenial there can be no exchange\nin the performance situation, and consequently\nunsuccessful performances.\nI think that one of the major problems\nwith experimental dance as performance\nlies with the performers.\nThere seems to be a basic lack of skill\nin how to project a message to an\naudience without chasing them out of\nthe theater. Likewise it seems to be a\nproblem to invite an audience in without\nrunning off stage. I call those\nsuffering from these problems Internal\nand External performers.\nThe Internal performer comes on\nstage and gives an impression of discomfort.\nWhat she is experiencing is\nan instant of identity crisis. Her focus\nis on her emotional and sensational\nexperiences. She wants to be “natural”\non stage, like her private rehearsals\nallow her to. Soon she realizes\nthat her inner worlds, so lively to her,\ndo not actually reach the audience the\nway she intends. Unfamiliar with this\nsudden lack of control, she withdraws\nto protect herself from the threat of an\naudience. This goes against her intention\nfor performing which is “I want\nyou to see inside of me.” She finds\nherself in a void, unable to express,\nand worse, unable to scream for help.\nAll everyone can do is to hope for the\nlights to fade out to bring the suffering\nto an end.\nThe External performer has most\nlikely been through the pain described\nabove and refuses to fall into that gap\nagain. Her intention for performing is\n“I don’t want you to see inside of\nme;” she wants to “come out” and\n“express.” Paradoxically she finds\nherself showing-off, where nothing but\nher big fat ego is stamping around the\nstage. In her desperate attempt to\nproject, she comes out of her body\nand has no access to her inner world.\nHer intention to invite her audience is\nwell meant, but she is not prepared to\nmeet them. She ends up screaming\neveryone’s ears off, her own included.\nNumb and deaf she has no chance to\ntune in, but seeks rescue by throwing\nherself in the audience’s lap.\nOver the past five years I have\nseen many experimental dance performances.\nI am still puzzled by why so\nfew of these dancers are able to communicate\nsuccessfully through this\nmedium. I have come to the conclusion\nthat one of the reasons for this\ndifficulty is the idea of performing\n“natural.”\n“Natural” expression was introduced\nduring the art era we operate\nwithin today, and often takes form as\npedestrian movement and behavior on\nstage. I suggest that “natural” came\nas a reaction against a traditional\nperformance mode in which scenes\nand emotions are performed beyond\n“natural,” in an exaggerated manner,\nto make sure the storyline or theme\ncomes through to the audience, who is\nfamiliar with its style and symbols.\nExperimental dance favours “natural”\nexpression on stage. The symbols\nwithin “natural” expression are\nuniquely part of the creator’s personal\n“language,” which is often foreign to\nher audience. This makes her performance\nchallenging. She has to “translate”\nto the audience, which requires\nsophisticated performance skills. If\nshe does not have these skills, communication\nlines are hard to develop.\nConsequently the message will not\nalways be perceivable to the audience.\nI find so-called “natural” expression\nfascinating, but I seldom see it\nperformed well. It seems to me that\nwhen stylization was sacrificed in\nfavour of “natural” expression, an\nimportant performing skill was buried\nalong with it. The intention of traditional\nperformance was to create a\nlarger-than-life experience, an “unreal\nreality” on stage. To project a larger-\nthan-life experience requires an altered\nstate of consciousness, an expanded\nawareness. I call this condition a\n“heightened state of being,” which was\npart of the traditional performer’s skill\nand, in my opinion, is rare to see in\ntoday’s experimental dance performers.\nI believe when experimental dancers\nwish to perform “natural” on stage,\nthey actually want to perform “being.”\nThere is much confusion around this\nissue. Many performers seem to think\nthat performing “being” is easy. It’s\nbeing “natural.” I believe that “being”\ndoesn’t happen just because we happen\nto be human beings, least of all\non stage. Performing “being” needs to\nbe practiced as any other performance\nactivity.\nI have seen a couple of performers,\nhowever, who successfully perform\n“being.” I would like to call\nthem Integrated. This performer comes\non stage with a sense of comfort. I\nfeel welcomed by her relaxed invitation\nto join the performance. Gladly I\nlet her take me on a ride through the\nworlds she creates. As an audience\nmember I am curious to experience\nsomebody else’s mind. That gives me\na rest from my worn out paths. We\n, are on the same horseback but she is\nin front of me. She has the reins and\nshe knows it, respecting and enjoying\nher power. She jumps us from one\nworld to the other. She knocks over\neverything she has built up, and sets\nme back in my audience seat. She\ntosses my attention back and forth and\nI am still with her. She knows that\neverything she sees, I see. She makes\nme look into her worlds from inside\nand outside. I have a bird’s eye view,\nI’m flying. My eyes have the sights\nof Gods. With the impression that\nI’m in complete control, I’m really\nmanipulated in the most sophisticated\nmanner and I love it. The Integrated\nperformer’s intention for performing is\n“I want you to see yourself through\nme.”\nThe Integrated performer has succeeded\nin building communication\nlines. She “translates” her chosen\n“language” to her audience. What\nenables her to do so is her performance\nskills. She has trained to\naccess a “heightened state of being.”\nThis state enables her to project her\nexperience to the audience. She is\nprojecting in the act of being aware of\nherself from the inside and outside\nsimultaneously. She has the introvert\nand the extrovert qualities and she inhabits\nthem so entirely that she transcends\nthem. She observes herself in\nrelation to all her actions, to her coperformers,\nto her audience, and to the\nperformance. She is relating. In real\nlife it is an almost impossible task to\nenter complete awareness as described.\nIn the performance situation the performer\nsets a frame around what she\nplans to relate to and when. Within\nthis frame it is possible to acquire the\n“heightened state of being” for a limited\nperiod of time, in a designated\nspace, within a defined action.\nI am in my ninth month of writing.\nThis text is now bom again out of the\nsame desperate need that made me\ngive birth to it again and again and\nagain, the need to sort out my thoughts\nto understand the feelings I have about\nexperimental dance as performance.\nThe words are hard to find. Through\ntalking, writing and trashing my ideas,\nfresh words are coming and coming\nand coming. This endless journey has\nhelped me clarify why I don’t believe\nin experimental dance as performance.\nSurprisingly, the better I get at\nsharpening my ideas, the more excited\nI get about dancing and performing. It\nseems that the confidence I develop\nfrom using words feeds my appreciation\nfor expressing without words.\nWhat satisfies me the most on my\nsearch is the connection I am experiencing\nto the rest of the world. Suddenly\nI am aware of my position as an\nartist in a much larger context. I\nbelong. That gives me confidence as\nan artist, performer and dancer. I can\ncommunicate, I can reach other people.\nWe live in the same world.\nSad but true, experimental dance\nperformances are seldom visited by\npeople other than artists. There is,\nhowever, an audience out there, people\nfrom the “outside world,” and I want\nto share with these people as well as\nthe already existing audience. I think\nmany people in the experimental\ndance community share that wish witl\nme.\nI feel that the community I have\nbeen part of for the past four years\nsuffers from a lack of verbal communication\nand constructive thoughtsharing.\nThe “discussions” that do\nhappen at our school are often coloured\nviews and feelings more with the\nintention of being heard and accepted\nthan with sharing their opinions to\ndeepen an issue of discussion. Some\npeople choose to explain this disperse\nlevel of discussion as a product of the\nproblem of non-native English speakers,\nas most of the students come frot\nall around Europe. I believe this is\nonly one part of the problem, because\nthe native English-speaking people at\nour school have just as much difficulty\nexpressing their views about dance\nand performance as the others. I thini\nit is due more to the fact that we do\nnot share a common language to discuss\ndance and art.\nDance is a non-verbal language\nand dancers are not used to expressin\nthrough words. Some dancers say the\nit is their privilege not to express verbally.\nI think this is everyone’s misfortune.\nDancers hold precious experience\nas communicators of a nonverbal\nlanguage. In a word-ridden\nworld, non-verbal languages have\ninvaluable worth. I believe that danc\ners and society as a whole will benefi\nfrom the evolution of a verbal language\nthat serves the non-verbal expression\nof dance. By mastering this\nlanguage, dancers can communicate\nbetter and support each other’s proces\nthrough constructive criticism. Mayb\nsome will find what I have, that deve\noping verbally enriches and excites tb\ndancing. Hopefully this communication\nwill extend to the “outside\nworld.” Maybe even dance critics wi\nbecome better convinced about experi\nmental dance as performance. It is al\nup to the experimental dancers whether\nthe situation will change or not.",

    "Content": "Min Tanaka & Butoh at Bennington College\n\n\n\nMIN TANAKA, master and\ninnovator in the Japanese dance form\nof Butoh, is an internationally recognized\nperformer and teacher. Created\nthe postwar period, Butoh draws upon\nagrarian myth, the theater of Antonin\nArtaud, and the Western modern\ndance. The rise of Butoh coincided\nwith similar expressions of freedom in\nart, music and architecture in postwar\nJapan.\n\nMin studied formal dance and\nclassical ballet while growing up, but\nbecame captivated with Butoh when he\nsaw a performance in the early ’60s\nfounder. Since then, Min has\ncarved a niche as part of that revolutionary\nmovement and through his own\nunique style, characterized by a freedom\nof form and motion and the special\nunion between the artist and his\nenvironment.\n\nMin began performing in the late\n1960s, frequently dancing nude in both\nurban and country landscapes and\nearning the nickname, ‘the naked\ndancer’. Since the ’70s, Min has\nconducted ‘‘Body Weather” workshops,\na series of movement concepts\nand techniques used for training the\nbody. Today, fourteen Body Weather\nlaboratories are active internationally.\nIn 1981, Min Tanaka formed MAI\nJJJKU, his international collaborative\ndance company; and in 1982, he was\na founding member of Plan B performing\nspace in Tokyo. He has toured as\na soloist and with Mai Juku throughout\nthe U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia,\nVietnam, and Russia.\nMin collaborates with a wide\nrange of artists, musicians, writers,\nphilosophers and researchers, and has\npioneered a multi-disciplinary paradigm\nfor expression.\nIn the spring of ’93, Min came to\nBennington College in Vermont for his\nfirst college residency in the U.S.\nSponsoring faculty member Terry\nCreach gathered for CQ the accompanying\nphotos and student writings\nalong with Min’s evaluations of this\nfertile period. In addition, Vermont\npoet Mary Ruefle offers a reflection\non Min’s solo performance of Kimono\nat the College. [Eds.]\n\nThrough a Visiting Professor grant\nfrom the Japan Foundation, the Dance\nDivision of Bennington College in\nBennington, Vermont was privileged\nto invite Min Tanaka for a six-week\nresidency, March 22 to April 30,\n1993—his first American college\nresidency. As a prominent international\nperformer, choreographer, and\ncompany director, Min is generally not\navailable in this way. He is also a\nfarmer, and had to continue, by fax, to\ndirect the spring planting at the Body\nWeather Farm in Hakushu, Japan, his\nhome base.\nHis time at Bennington was full\nand varied, including Body Weather\nworkshops which were open to the\npublic; a solo performance of Kimono;\nand a duet performance, Improvisation,\nwith Bennington professor and\nnoted percussionist, Milford Graves—\nto one of the largest audiences ever\nassembled in Bennington College’s\nMartha Hill Dance Theater.\nMin taught an intensive course\ntitled, “Butoh Dance,” and collaborated\nwith faculty Terry Creach and Sue\nRees, and dancers and sculptors from\nMulti-Disciplinary Performance class\nto create Night-Day—a campus-wide,\nsite-specific work that included performances\n—a cast of thirty. During the residency,\nMin Tanaka and Milford\nGraves traveled to Burlington, Vermont’s\nFlynn Theater for a repeat of\nImprovisation, and Min traveled to\nNew York City for a solo performance\nof Seasons at Performance Space 122.\nIn the Butoh Dance course, Min\npresented, or coaxed us through, exercises,\ngames and talks aimed at freeing\nthe glue which holds our boundaries,\nhabits and expectations together. The\nintegral connection of the senses to the\nbody’s range of movement was emphasized\nin dozens of creative and\nsurprising ways in order to build a\ncompletely organic and authentic form\nof dance—a dance in direct reaction to\nthe senses and emotions. One afternoon\nwas spent exploring an expanse\nof the early spring outdoors blindfolded\nwith a guide who remained silent\nand out of reach (unless we got into\ndanger). One morning we all jumped\nrope amidst laughter and yells of encouragement\nto the hesitant from the\nbrave.\nDuring the last weeks of the course\nwe focused on 65 movement images\nfor isolated parts of the body such as:\nfish swim in your stomach; your face\nbecomes your mother’s or father’s\nface; your hands climb a waterfal\n“Min believed that movement starts\nas a feeling within, and only then does\nit have the possibility of becoming\nouter movement. He also strongly\nfeels that even if a feeling fails to\nevoke outer movement, it is still dance\n(or still dance!),” wrote Eva Fitzgerald\nin her student evaluation for the\ncourse.\nThe most important lesson that I\ncame away with was quite the opposite\nof a knowledge of a new dance style\nor technique; it was instead the very\nbeginning of an understanding of the\nessential, soulful, and barest bones of\nthis expression called dance: the difference\nbetween how one’s body moves\nwhen one interprets or “acts out” a\nwaterfall, for instance, and when one\nattempts to feel, to really be a waterfall.\nAll of us who were inspired by\nMin Tanaka strive to keep this sensitized\nway of living with us even after\nhe’s gone. Min writes back from\nJapan: “When I’m working in the\nfield, sometime suddenly the landscape\nand air and sound of Bennington visit\nmy body... I had many inspirations\nfrom your environment, and I feel\nsome things are growing in my body.\nTomorrow I am going to dance, I am\nvery much interested in my improvisation.\nI am not sure, but some change\n(big!) will happen.”\n\n\nSTUDENT EVALUATIONS\nOF THE BUTOH COURSE (excerpts)\nDuring this intense Butoh class, I have\nexperienced a change of perception:\ndance is not only techniques and controlled\nbody movements, but also a movement\nof the mind. I gained a new appreciation\nof the world around me and the\nconnection between nature and human\nmovement.\nI came to appreciate specificity, and slow\nrich time. There is plenty of time to live,\njust not time to be indecisive.\nPushing limits—carrying heavy rocks\nin bare feet 45 degrees F. outside; covering\nour eyes and having to follow a path\nwith concrete directions; trusting our partners\nwith every exercise; letting go; embracing\nfear around emotion (I took it\nseriously), but Min could always laugh.\nHis gentle eyes swept over us identifying,\nunderstanding and a bit of giggling. He\nshowed, well I understand, that life is hart\nand painful but we must laugh to appreciate\nIn one class, all the students chose a\npartner and each took a turn being blindfolded.\nMin designated a route of obstacles\nfor the blind student to find. The\n■ outcome was a huge surprise, most students\nwere unable to complete this simple\ntask in an area we all walk through on a\ndaily basis. In this exercise and others,\nthe students didn’t master the task but became\naware of their own disability, i.e.,\n\\ how ^pendent we are on our eyes and\nhow lame our other senses have become.\nMin taught me to slow down and build my\nawareness of the many small sensations\nwhich we are continually blocking out.\nOnce this awareness is stronger it can be\nused as a steady foundation to inform\nmovement. The small movements came\nfrom written images designed to be stimulation\nfrom outside for movement and\ndance. This is contrary to much dance\nwhich is interaction with oneself, or going\ninside to find the creativity. Creativity\ncame out of interaction with the small\nmovements.\n\nThe main focus in the class was on 65\n“small movement images,” which we\nwould practice with partners, alternating\nroles of giving the images and feeling\nthem. The images engaged specific parts\nof the body as a source for movement.\nExamples: torso becomes mist; holding a\njust bom naked baby; waterfall running\ndown your sides; you have 100 meters\nlong hair blowing in the wind while simultaneously\nyour legs are walking up a\nstrong river. By the final week we were\nworking with the head, arms, torso, and\nlegs all moving from separate images\nsimultaneously. These exercises demanded\nboth a focus and an awareness of the\nbody’s feeling. As we worked in this way,\nI found that I became more conscious of\nmy body and its ability to express.\nIt broadened my conception of dance and\nput me in touch with parts of my body that\nI never consciously worked with before\n(like the heart). The most striking experience\noccurred when my partner had to\nmake me move without touching me, and\nI felt my partner’s heat on my skin and\ndiscovered with surprise that my arm was\nmoving in the direction she was thinking\nof! Min put me in touch with the small\nmovements in and outside of me. For\nexample, on the last day of classes, the\nstudents were asked to hug a tree and\nfeel its movements! Min showed us how\ndance couldn’t always be seen—it had to\nbe felt.\nMin encouraged us to find our own movements.\nWe experienced the world blind,\ntalked with trees, were led around by a\nstring, and beat a jump rope’s wrath. Min\ntaught me that any daily experience can\nhave some kind of lesson, whether for\ndance or life in general.\nWe placed a very heavy rock on our\nchests, and just let it rest there feeling the\nweight in our body, the changes of beat\nthat would occur in our hearts. Watching\nmy heartbeat transfer from deep within my\nribcage to a huge, cmshing rock that lay\nheavily on my chest brought me more joy\nthan imaginable.\nIn the blindfolded walk, I was tmly able to\nget a sense of my surroundings and feel\nwhat it was like to use my instincts and\nother senses to move instead of being so\nconscious of watching and thinking.\n\nMIN’S EVALUATIONS\nOF STUDENTS IN HIS BUTOH CLASS\n\n\nTrain your lower part of the body, and\nfind good stream In your legs.\nI like your small movement Good\ndensity.

Keep dancing every\nmoment.\n\n\nOn MIN TANAKA’S KIMONO\nLetters to Christina Svane\nApril 3, 1993\nI went to see Min Tanaka perform\na solo at the college. I must tell you\nhis performance was quite possibly the\nmost powerful dance performance I\nhave ever seen—which I shall try to\nexplain—a difficult proposition. The\naudience sat/stood around a cleared\nspace in a large carpeted lobby of the\narts building but when the extraordinary\nmusic began (opera—I believe,\nItalian—a woman’s aria) Min began to\ndance outside the building—through\nglass—at night—maybe 25 yards\naway—leaning under/on a little cherry\ntree, bare (the tree) in the cold spring\nnight with the wind blowing. Tanaka\nwas rice-powdered to a ghostly effect—with\nblack kimono and his hair\nbeing lifted in the wind and the dance\nbegan there, at a distance, through\nglass, eventually working its (his) way\nup to the glass, when we could see\n(his face pressed against it) the “painful”\ngestures. At this point he entered\nthe room and performed in the space\nat hand—master Butoh, typical Butoh\nwith an informal bit/twisL The last\nthird of the piece was again done in\nretreat—through the door, against the\nglass, out under the brave little cherry\ntree, the same music (the interior segment\nhad been silent), the same wind\nblowing through his hair,—except\nnow, having seen him up close, we\nknew what he was doing out there—\nand our knowledge made no difference—for\nit was there, at a distance,\nthat the dance was perceived to be the\nmost beautiful, lyrical, graceful dance\nI had ever seen—so what was powerful\nto me was the sudden realization\nthat pain when seen from a distance\nappears to be beautiful—and that was\nwhat struck me most about the performance,\nwhat haunts me and what I\ncannot forget—and it leads me to\nwonder if a “beautiful, lyrical” dance\nwhen seen from the right angle or distance\nmight not appear to be painful—and,\nfinally, it appears to me\nthere is no such thing as “joyous” or\n“painful” dancing/movement—both are\nillusions. The distance of life from the\nthing—it does not appear to be spring,\nbut it is.\n\nApril 8,1993\nC—\nI spoke with Martha Wittman, a\nmember of the dance faculty at Bennington,\nabout Min Tanaka’s performance—the\none I tried, so awkwardly,\nto describe to you in my last letter—\nMartha was a source of great understanding\nand clarity for me, helping to\nput it in perspective. Min’s body was\nnot covered with rice-powder, as I\nthought, but with earth, clay from\nvarious parts of the earth that have\nmeant something for him—southern\nFrance, his farm in Japan—and the\nkimono he wore belonged to his mother,\nwho is dead—at times he was the\nkimono, at times he was his mother, at\ntimes he was a baby, a toddler, at\ntimes he was the cherry tree, at times\nhe was a bird, stepping with claws\ninstead of feet—like Keats, he seems\nto “peck about the gravel and become\nthe sparrow”—he seems to have no\nidentity of his own but to be a medium.\nI also hadn’t guessed what Martha\ntold me—that the entire performance\nwas improvised—astonishing—\nof course, if you are going to be a\nmedium you must improvise—there is\nno other way. Ultimately, my ‘realization’\nthat “pain at a distance appeared\nbeautiful” was actually closer to the\nmark than I thought—because I think\nat times, even close up, I read “pain”\ninto what was not pain—who is to say\nthat a bird in joy will not appear to be\na bird in pain?—humans read pain/joy\ninto things and creatures—pain and joy\nare our touchstones, our sentiments,\nand I do think now, in retrospect, that\nmany of the ‘painful’ gestures were\nsimply bird-gestures, tree-gestures,\nkimono-gestures that were like nothing\nI had ever seen before, nothing I could\nrecognize, nothing I could embrace—\nkiss—love and so mentally I was the\none who contorted them into something\nI could make sense out of—\nlove,\nM—\nA Postscript\nJanuary 1994\nAfter seeing Min Tanaka perform\nKimono at Bennington College in the\nspring of 1993—a piece I described\nmy response to in two letters to my\nfriend Christie Svane—I went to see\nhim perform again, twice, both times\nin collaboration with other artists, and\nneither event moved me in the ways I\nwas moved, and continue to be\nmoved, by Kimono. I have only the\ndimmest memories of the subsequent\nperformances, whereas I am still\nhaunted by the whitened face and\nblowing black hair set against that\nlittle cherry tree, which is in all probability\nno cherry tree at all. In the\nweeks after this image was implanted\nin me, I sought out the music that was\nso much a part of it: it turned out not\nto be an Italian aria, but Kiri Te Kanawa\nsinging one of Canteloube’s\nChants D’Auvergne, a collection of\nFrench folk songs compiled and transcribed\nfirst half of this century. The song\nTanaka used was “Bail&ro,” a kind of\nbanter between a shepherd and shepherdess\nwhose pastures are separated\nruns like this:\n— Shepherd, yonder across the river,\nsurely you are not having much fun?\n— None at all, and are you?\n— Shepherd, the grass is in flower,\ncome over here to tend your flock.\nThe grass is better in my field!\nAt a glance, the banter is light-hearted,\nalmost fun, but in fact the music is\nvery, very sad, straining towards an\nunbearable sweetness, full of the impossibility\nof crossing the river, perhaps\nthe uselessness of their desire, or\nthe uselessness of ever leaving one’s\nown little world for that of another.\nI’ve listened to it for a long time now,\nand lately it appears to embody just\nabout everything I experienced in the\ndance. If Tanaka was ever for a moment\nhis mother, surely she was in a\nheaven, asking us to join her, and I\nstayed on my side of the river, very\nconfused about whose side was the\nsad side.",

    "Abstract": "",
    "Content": "Group. That7s what we've called it for years. Not\n\"dance group\" or \"the group\" or \"improv group\"—just\n\"group.\" No blueprints. No rules—rather lots of rules all\nof which we break. But a history which we love to tell\nourselves as the years go by and the story gets longer.\nI've been part of group since 1983. I was very presumptuous,\nreally. I called Herb when I moved to Amherst, a\ncolleague had given me his name, and invited myself to\ngroup one night. And, even more presumptuous, I then\nassumed I was part of the group. Herb, a physicist, Mary,\nan artist, Alton, a therapist and minister, were there—at\nHerb and Mary's home, where group meets. Also, Mary-\nianne, a therapist. She was impatient with talking, if I\nremember, wanting us to keep moving. Maryianne left\nshortly after I joined. We were four for a while. Then\nBecky, another dancer, joined a year or two later. We love\ngoing over this. People have visited (we always remember\nthe psychologist who sweated, a dancer friend of someone's,\netc.). We even had a new member for a year—'til he left\nand took a job elsewhere, but not until after encouraging us\nto develop and then perform an initiation ritual. So it's\nbeen us five for a long time. Although when I first shared\nthis writing with group Herb was quick to ask me how I\nknow I am really a member.\nOur medium is movement and dance. We improvise.\nSo what happens in group? For years my kids thought I\nwent and got high once a week with some friends. Herb\nand Mary's kids hung out on the top steps peeking through\nthe banister. It must have seemed strange.\nA typical night: Clear the room. Music. Free form\ndancing—self warm-up—interaction or not—little conversations\nor not. A structure—group improvisation. Solos—\nwith or without images. Talking. Put the furniture back.\nAnd then eat. In the kitchen.\nThe Crystals. Years back we went through a phase\nwhere the evening's group dancing would end with each\nperson performing a solo \"crystal,\" a movement theme, an\nimage, a feeling, which reached for the essence of the evening^\nexperience, or grew from a life theme of importance\nat the moment. As part of our non-serious seriousness or\nserious non-seriousness we played with naming ourselves\nThe Crystals. That year we met on Tuesdays...thus \"The\nTuesday Night Crystals\" were bom. The following year we\nbecame \"The Tuesday Night Crystals Who Meet on\nWednesdays.\" The title gradually became part of the history\nwe reiterate.\nStructures. Simple or complicated, a way of focusing\nour attention. Duets with trio transitions. Or trios with\nduet transitions. Or some variation thereof. I always get\nconfused. Is the \"trio\" the dance or the \"duet\"? And does\nit matter! All kinds of variations possible on the above.\nSolos to duets, duets to solos. Herb then figures out how\nmany dances there will be. Everyone else says it doesn't\nmatter.\nImages and solos. We almost always end with solos. A\nway of capturing something essential, vital, of the moment,\nof having everyone's attention, in the moment. Years back\nwe timed them. Two minute solos. Three minute solos.\nOne minute solos. And now we don't. Did the timer break\nor get lost or simply no longer serve a purpose?\nFor years now we share images. One structure: the\ngroup sits close around whoever's turn it is to dance. All\nclose eyes. Light touch on the person in the center. Empty\nthe mind. Allow an image to arise in your consciousness—a\npicture, a sound, a kinesthetic sensation. Catch the first one.\nNo censoring or waiting for a \"better\" one. Tell it to the\ndancer. Then a solo. How delighted I get, tickled and bemused,\nwhen similar images occur around the circle. A\nvalidation of the non-verbal sharing, intuitive relating, we\npractice together. Sometimes we seem to go for the archetypal,\nsometimes geometric and formal. Occasionally we get\ngoofy and all start seeing salamis.\nWhat does this not say? That for about two years we\nused \"Little Creatures\" by Talking Heads as warm-up music\nevery week. That Gloria Gaynor's \"I Will Survive\" is our\ntheme song. That sometimes the men dance self-consciously\nas \"the men\" and sometimes the women do likewise. That\nHerb—if we're not alert—might he down and go to sleep.\nThat Becky and I, as we work together, have to be careful\nnot to get started talking shop. That Mary makes incredibly\nwitty wisecracks. That Alton can reach the ceiling with a\nfinger and sometimes becomes a connection between heaven\nand earth.\n\"A little more about each of us\" was the group advice\nafter reading my first draft. Here goes...\nHerb keeps us feeling guilty if there's a movement afoot\nto cancel for a week. He makes the calls that pull us together\nafter a summer or a winter break. He looks rabbinical in\nan old-fashioned way, a startling contrast to his commitment\nto developing as an expressive dancer/mover. The images\nHerb offers sometimes reflect his knowledge of physics—\nfields of forms, geometric, changing, fractal-ish. As group\nhappens in his home, we share, in a weekly way, his way of\nfathering, family-ing. So often I think how profoundly\nfamily life and roles have changed when sharing Herb's\nway of being with his kids. Two or three generations ago\nhe would have been part of an orthodox Jewish community.\nHis grandfather was a famous kosher butcher on the Lower\nEast Side for decades. The observances are there, as he and\nMary raise their family steeped in Jewish traditions. And,\nfrom time to time, in his solos, I catch glimpses of another\ntime, another place, the life his might have been. Seated\nfacing us, eyes closed, waiting for movement, dark curly\nbeard, hands start to move as if speaking blessings from an\nancient time. Sometimes his brow and face start working\nsounds may emerge as he connects to places in himself that\nneed to move to be shared and revealed. He has practiced\ndance and learned ease and comfort in his body. I marvel\nat the choices that brought Herb to value this.\nMary. A visual artist, mother of two, a wit. She's married\nto Herb...not always an easy role (what would the\nwisecrack be to that observation?). Keeps us growing.\nEncourages newness amidst our familiarity, challenges\nperceptions. Living with the self-challenge of pursuing her\nart in a time when so many people define themselves by\nemployment status. Rich to share her growth and changes\nalong this pathway. Gratifying to hear her recently expressing\na sense of rightness and delight in her choices. In our\ndancing Mary and I often become animal. Last year we got\ninto a fight. I pulled her hair. Got carried away. Didn't\nrealize I had pulled it hard. She then pulled mine. What a\nshock to both of us. This became a theme for a while.\nWe'd circle each other, lunge, grab and grapple, laugh. I\nmarvel at the wisdom of her wit, look forward to her quick\ncommentaries, am amazed by the richly drawn images she\nsees when she closes her eyes. Places or people or scenes\nthat are rich in color and texture and form and design. Anc\nafter dancing she starts cutting fruit or putting on water for\ntea or finding bowls for ice cream. It has been such a pleasure\nfor me, over these years, to sit at her table, accept that\nnurturing, let down from my own activity in that role.\nReminds me of the ease with which aunts and uncles would\nbe in and out of each other's homes when I was a kid.\nComfort on so many levels.\nAlton. He's tall, slender and fit. A blend of, for want of\na better term, \"new age\" consciousness and openness, ministerial\ngroundedness, psychological and therapeutic astuteness,\nand hardworking gardener, builder and back hills\nhomesteader. He's funny and wise, offering insights into\nhimself or others in a way that makes for real laughter. I\ntreasure that Alton treasures this group. He's like a bridge\nor link between and among several groups in the area.\nAlton has evolved work which draws on all he has done, as\na minister, dancer, therapist. A special kind of insight,\nteaching and leadership, not defined or practiced in traditional\nways. Creating contexts. He's gifted at that And his\ndancing. Alton performs solos seriously, patiently. He has\na gift for allowing characters to emerge—an old seer, a fool,\na youth—for embodying a wide range of emotion. A gift\nfor allowing stillness—trusting that we will stay focussed\nwith him as he waits, transforms, and develops the character\nor image or story which comes through. Dancing with\nAlton is fun and exciting, from contact duets to waltzes and\nthen who knows what. Always a great joy.\nThen there's Becky. Hardest to write about because\ngroup is just one part of what we share as we also share\nwork and families and friendship in daily ways. Duets with\nBecky. I always marvel at the fineness of the bones in her\nhands, long thin fingers. Delicate strength. The dancer\nBecky. Able to transform images into fully realized, fully\nembodied form Often performs part of a solo in profile,\nlinear spatial pathway, across the space, defining file space.\nSudden surprising movements. A spring to a forced arch,\nan amazing extended balance. A wry glance to the audience.\nEven on evenings when she arrives tired from having\ntaught two classes already that day and dealt with all sorts\nof college governance and student advising and and and,\nshe finds the reserve for solos of force, dynamism, speed\nand drama. So many dramatic personae. Helps keep us\naware of performing, creating, and shaping, in the moment,\nfully. (Heaven forbid we become simply self-indulgent!)\nBecky's ticklish (do I dare put that in?), sexy (or that?),\nimaginative in movement and in responses to the movement\nof others. I keep coming back to her hands—expressive,\nsensitive, articulate and fine, as she is herself. I remember\nyears ago a former colleague, Rosalind de Mille, saying after\na performance of \"Piaf,\" a solo for Becky, \"Well, she sure is\nspecial, our Becky.\" What a joy to share this kind of play\nand communication together in group.\nGroup suggested that I include their description of me.\nThey sat around Herb and Mary's kitchen table and wrote:\n\"Peggy is our elf, wise and energetic, an enthusiastic talker\nand sharer of stories, keeper of the group lore, rememberer\nof birthdays, attentive to the details of the lives of .those\naround her. She is the mother of three daughters whose\nadolescence they all survived with closeness and friendship\nintact. Peggy's bi-coastal marriage keeps her stretched but\nwe like to think she works her travel schedule around us.\nIn movement she always seems ready to connect and join\nwith others. Her solos begin lightly and dancerly but move\noften and easily to an emotional depth. Her gestures are\nreaching, but from a sense of groundedness. Peggy takes\nthe role of nurturer and confidante in the group. Her\nwarmth and valuing of our work and play together shelters\nand protects the fullness of our space.\" It moves me to be\nso lovingly witnessed.\n\nSometimes we blubble, as in group amoeba, forming and\nreforming.\nOften we laugh, sometimes full-bodied belly laughter.\nMore often just plain hysterics.\nSometimes group's a place to bring a problem or grief or\nlife disturbance and get help—verbally, non-verbally. And\nsometimes it's a place to be able to leave all that aside.\nA place of total trust. And I don't say that lightly. I say\nthat with awe—aware of a kind of weekly miracle—to be\nable to gather—dance—interact—laugh—play—cry—discuss—and\nknow whatever is said or done, there's total\nacceptance of one another.\nFriendships overlap outside of group. We are part of\neach other's lives, yet socially we don't all meet too often.\nGroup is for some other purpose than simply being with\nfriends. We know each other very well.\nYou get blackballed if you miss group. (There are no\nconsequences to being blackballed.) You might get two\nblackballs if you didn't have a good reason. And then there\nare all sorts of adolescent jokes about blueballs. Recently\nthe adolescent jokes focused on hard drives and floppy\ndiscs. Use your imagination.\nWe give birthday inspections. A birthday inspection is\nlike a loving massage, with running commentary on the\nnew grey hair, what seems to be holding up well and\nwhat's wearing out If you're not at group around your\nbirthday you can have your inspection after your birthday,\nnever before. But if you haven't had your inspection and\nsomeone else's birthday comes along, you miss your turn\nfor a whole year! I don't think that's ever happened, although\nevery time this comes up, Herb insists we skipped\nhim about three years ago and owe him one.\nWe sometimes set up special lights and a video camera\nand video an evening—but never remember to watch it.\nWe joke about performing and touring—'The Tuesday\nNight Crystals Hit the Road\"—and plan what we'll wear.\nWe don't take ourselves seriously—yet love how serious\nand meaningful and real this non-seriousness is.\nWe each play our part in the group. Sometimes, someone,\nafter many years, changes their role. That's extraordinary\nor ordinary, noted or not.\n(I'm reminded of a book group that a girlhood friend's\nparents belonged to while we were growing up. 'The\nBookworms.\" I imagine we serve a similar role in each\nother's lives as members of that group did, feel lucky to\nhave a found a group as that other group did in another\ntime and place, with another medium)\nFolk culture. Community. Art. Family. Therapy.\nGroup history intersects with personal history and we become\na microcosmic community—a wedding, deaths, bat\nmitzvahs, graduations—the kinds of life changes one shares\nover many years of knowing others. The \"remember the\ntime...\" weaves in and out of group activity, life activity.\nThis dance group—\"Group\"—provides a place to live\nwhat I believe, what I teach. In teaching dance improvisa-\n* tion, I foster group awareness, trust, openness. At the end\nof each term, my students usually express anxiety and\nsadness that they will no longer be a group. How extraordi-\nnary—the continuity of this group in our lives.\nI'm not a historian of my life—don't save programs,\nkeep a journal, clip clippings, or record dreams. At times I\nwish I did and then think—too late—why start now?\nThere's a way in which group holds my history. The history\nis in the movement.\nStart a group! A few people—one who'll keep you\nmoving, one who'll make you laugh, one who brings ice\ncream or champagne, depending, all who love to move. Be\nfaithful to your form and to your commitment to dance with\neach other. Keep meeting and dancing—weeks become\nmonths become years.\nI know there are other dance groups in this area, the\nPioneer Valley in Western Massachusetts, each serving as a\ntouchstone for communities such as Dance Spree, contradancing,\nswing dance, and Contact Improvisation jams.\nFolk art. The dance goes on in many forms.\nRules come and go. The \"remember when\" list grows\nand grows. We take such pleasure in recounting our history\nto ourselves. Our bodies are changing, aging. (\"No one\nunder 40.\" That's a rule now. Used to be no one under 30.\nHeading toward no one under 50!)\nA real concern with visitors and potential members—\nthat their standards will not be low enough for us...\nNo expectations.\nThe self in motion/selves in motions. Group body.\nExtraordinary dancing. Simple dancing. Trusting. Laughing.\nEating ice cream\nThe Tuesday Night Crystals...thought it time to share.",

    "Content": "HERESY, a movement-oriented musical\nSo right in the middle of\ndeciding what to do with some ill-\ngotten lucre, I thought, let’s see how I\ncan help eliminate cultural greed, military\nand governmental power abuse,\nand educational dogma. Recognizing\nthat the societal predilection towards\nthe Jewish/Christian mythology is relatively\nirrelevant to our collective\nwell-being. And that the design and\nroles of inter-gender relationships,\nsexual (mis) behaviour, love and lust\nare inextricably confused.\nA lot of the lie of the land has to\ndo with language: some words are too\nbrittle, like “sensitive” or “queer”;\nsome too fat, like “diet” and “spiritual”;\nor too saturated, like “pussy” and\n“come.” Individual language has got\nburied, beneath computers, cars, cameras,\ncoffee, candy and crack. I gathered\nwhat I had gleaned over these\nmany years, placed in black, large,\nplastic sack; and then cut a small slit\nin the bottom to see what seeped out.\nYou need so much fuckin patience.\nAnd willingness to risk. And integrity.\nFirst came the H. Secondly, H E.\nThen, HER. Fourthly, H E R E .\nThen, H E R E S. And lastly, HER\nE S Y. The orifice became larger.\nThemes and scenes and characters and\nsongs and choreography and costumes\nand set design. HERESY is a musical\nwith 13 songs, nine performers, four\nmusicians. As I got It, I wrote It. No\ncensoring, no judging, no holding\nback. The story is crude and funny\nand perverse and sexual. Not for\nevery one. Including select performers.\nThree dropped out. Prick and\nnigger, abortion and kikes, rape and\nfaggot. People kept getting hung up\non cunt? Oh well, nothing new under\nthe sun. Impossible to change ideas\nand thought patterns without making\nthem conscious.\nHERESY is about cultural cancer\nand the debasement of the human\nbody. It is about America and the\nAmerican idiom and the media. I\nintended to turn words outside in, so\nthe audience could put them back\ntogether in an individualized way:\nWill you choose me with your\nouzi?\nIn my ass or in my pou-ssy?\nAh! That’s where it’s at!\nRat-A-Tat-Tat...\nWords are pure. At least like air\nand oceans are pure. The same one-\nnation-under-god who continue to\nclearcut forests, turn rivers into septic\nsystems and spend fifty percent of its\nmassive budget on greasing the world\nwith military lard, owns language.\nBut not quite. In creating HERESY I\nfound a means to effect the white\nmiddle-upper class. Not to meet force\nwith force, but to enter the realm in\nwhich “abuse” and “rape” and “war”\nand “more” are generated and charged;\nand neutralize them.\nHERESY IN BRIEFS\nThe central nervous system of\nHERESY is the family—primary education,\ninstilled values, support and\nlack thereof, mores. On the periphery\nother relationships—church, school,\ngovernment, friends. Always human\nsexuality, pulsing above, on, and beneath\nthe surface.\nHERESY has no spine, nor heart to\nspeak of. Only miscellaneous limbs\nand organs, waiting to be transplanted.\nChoose what you need and want for\nyour person to thrive.\nIn HERESY things are not weighted.\nEvil and good belong to the spectator.\nThe dark and shadowy side\ndepends from where you are casting\nyour light\n\nThere’s a linear, familiar story\nwhich occurs in episodes: As the\ncurtain opens, Father (PaP), cloaked\nall in black goes off to work, to war,\nto whatever. Mother takes charge,\nloves her son, dislikes her daughter,\nand colludes with Son (QueueX) to\ndrug his Sister (Rozde) so he can have\n“his way with her. And I mine.” The\nDaughter resists, but, both in dance\nand metaphor, is taken anyway. The\nBrother (“the male in these parts”) is\naccused by Sister Rozee and Mother\nCulla, now anti-male, pro-female. The\nBrother/Son is tried and judged. The\nFather finally returns, carrying black\nnoose, and the Son is hung (hanged).\nThese characters are not archetypes,\nnot myths. As HERESY is a\nmandala of modem American culture,\neach family member is a collage of\nmemories.\nHERESY is a movement-oriented\nmusical. It’s about having fun in life.\nEnjoying the “good parts”—“When his\nspirit 6-jS.c-Q-12.tt6 down my throat, I\ncry, ‘My lord! My lord! Thou hast\nnot forsaken me’.” About making fun\nof societal taboos, religion and sex\nand gender issues, war and materialism,\nself-abusive therapy and science\n(the linguistics of snot).\nHERESY is an erect reminder not\nto nestle into the illusory nature of\nthings.

    "Content": "In tro du c tio n\nOver the years, I have had the\npleasure and challenge of working\nwith several thousand highly-skilled\nmovers: professional ballet and modern\ndancers; classical, jazz and rock musicians;\nathletes of all sorts, including a\nwoman who swam around Manhattan\nand a man who ran across the USA.\nIn my role as their neuromuscular\ntrainer, I practice specialized movement\nproblem-solving.\nFor example, one dancer needed\nsubtle shifts in the way she moved her\nneck while doing a pirouette (spin on\none foot), a pianist had to change the\nway he used his fourth finger just\nbefore it touched the key, the man\nwho ran across the country needed to\napproach stretching his hamstrings in\nan entirely new way. Before changing\ntheir movements, these individuals\nexperienced pain or diminished quality\nof performance.\nIn each case, there was a period of\ntime during our meetings when I put\nmy hands on the surface of the person’s\nbody and practiced intentional\ntouch: a highly specific and purposeful\nmovement communication between\nmyself and the human being whom I\nam touching. During my touch interaction\nwith performers, they are likely\nto ask, “What are you doing now?”\nSometimes there were no questions\nuntil after the intentional touch interaction,\nwhen the person was again practicing\npirouettes or running. Noting\nbetter balance or faster running time,\nhe/she might ask, “What did you do?\nIt felt like you weren’t doing anything,\nbut somehow, now I feel completely\ndifferent.”\nThis article is a response to the\nquestion of what I am doing physically\nwhen I’m practicing intentional touch.\nTouching, by its nature, is simultaneously\nboth a means of perception\nand a means of action, although my\nconscious attention may be focused\nprimarily on one or another at any one\ntime.\nIn Part I of this article, I will\nfocus on the directional movement I\nperform/induce when I touch someone.\nIt may be apparent from my student’s\nquestion that my action and/or movement\nis often very subtle. Although\nthe touch interaction may continue for\nsome minutes, it may involve very\nsmall movements in terms of space\nand force exerted. If the reader\nchooses to practice the explorations\ndescribed in Part I, he/she will discover\nthat tiny movements as well as\nlarger movements can be communicated\nclearly to another person. I call\nthese movements which I convey\nthrough my touch, “lines of movement,”\nor “vectors of motion.”\nIn Part II of the article, I will\nfocus on the identification and understanding\nof specific structures through\ntouch. I will describe how I identify\neach structure of the body and locate\nit functionally within a body system\nsuch as the muscular or skeletal system.\nI will also discuss some of the\nways in which I use my hands to\ncommunicate kinesthetically with each\nof the body systems. It is not within\nthe scope of this article to describe\nhow or on what basis I create the\nspecific movement choreography\nwhich I convey through my intentional\ntouch to the various tissues. The\neffort to do so would be too complex\nand lengthy, since the choreography I\ncreate is unique to each situation and\nperson.\nOnce I can identify the specific\nstructure with which I am communicating,\nthen the location, direction,\nspeed, timing, force, and phrasing of\nthe movement I convey can be exquisitely\nrefined. Through my movement,\nI can gain understanding of the\ncurrent state of that structure, its immediate\nmovement preferences and\nlimitations, and its future movement\npotential for easy and adaptive function.\nAs I “talk” with my hands, each\nbody system “tells” me more and\nmore about what we can do together.\n\nPART I:\nINDUCING MOVEMENT\nTo induce motion through touch,\nthere are two actions I can use: I can\n“push,” or “send,” a vector of force\nfrom my hand towards another person;\nand I can “pull,” or “attract,” a vector\nof force from that person towards\nmyself.\nFor example, I can place my hand\non the small of my companion’s back\nto gently push him/her forward out a\ndoor in front of us. This is an action\nof “sending” through touch. Alternatively,\nif I reach my hand around my\ncompanion’s shoulder and pull him/her\ntowards me to make way for a third\nparty, this is an action of “attracting”\nthrough touch.\nThe following activities are designed\nto give touch practitioners\nconscious control over these movements\nas well as physical efficiency in\ntheir performance. In this series of\nexplorations, you will practice:\nA) Sending a vector of motion\nfrom yourself to/through your\npartner (so the directionality is\naway from your hand).\nB) Attracting a vector of motion\nfrom/through your partner’s body\nto yourself (so that the directionality\nis towards your hand).\nC) Alternating between sending\nand attracting.\nD) Using both hands simultaneously\nin various combinations of\nsending and attracting.\n\nDuring these explorations, you will\nnot necessarily move your partner\nthrough visible space. Instead, the\nmovement you communicate may produce\nchanges inside your partner’s\nbody which both of you can perceive\nkinesthetically though not visually.\nA) Sending a vector of motion from\nself to!through a partner.\nStand facing your partner’s side\nwith the palm of your hand on the\noutside of your partner’s nearest arm.\nSend a series of vectors of motion to\nyour partner with various temporal\ndynamics. You might try thrusting\nvery quickly and suddenly (staccato\ndynamics) or pushing smoothly and\ncontinuously with minute increments\nof force (legato dynamics).\nWhile still facing your partner,\nchange your distance to him/her as you\npractice sending. When you are close,\nyou can might send primarily with\nyour fingers and palm, which can exert\nthe greatest refinement of motor skill\nand, relatively the least amount of\nforce. Now move further away, and\ntry sending with your forearm and\nelbow as well, which affords you some\nmore force. With even more distance\nfrom your partner, you can send a\nvector of motion from your spine and\nshoulder. This allows you to send\nwith the greatest amount of power and\nthe least amount of refined control. If\nyou exert power from your torso and\nshoulder and fine skill from your\nfingers simultaneously, then your\nsending action can most fully convey\nyour movement intentions.\nExperimentation will show you\nwhich manner of sending is most\ncomfortable for you as well as most\neffective in communicating motion to\nyour partner. If you are functioning in\na way that is very inefficient for your\nown body, your partner will sense\nyour physical distress and will reflect\nit by either trying to help or by resisting\nyour strivings.\nB) Attracting a vector of motion\nfrom!through your partner.\nMaintaining the same position as\nabove relative to your partner, keeping\nyour whole palm in contact with the\nsurface of your partner’s arm, gently\ngrasp your partner’s arm between your\nthumb and fingertips. Slowly pull\nyour partner’s arm towards you with\nyour hand. Step back from your partner,\nlighten the pressure of your fingertips\nas much as you can without\nbreaking the contact between you, and\nagain draw the arm towards your\nchest.\nStill with your entire palm touching\nthe surface of your partner’s arm,\nvisualize your palm as a parabolic disc\nor magnet drawing a vector of motion\nout of the ground under your partner’s\nfeet, up through your partner’s body,\nout your partner’s arm, and into your\nown hand. Now go even further, imagining\nthat the “magnet” is under the\nsoles of your feet instead of under the\nskin of your palm, taking the vector of\nmotion you receive from your partner\ninto your own palm, inward through\nyour arm, through your torso and legs,\nout the soles of your feet, and into the\nground.\nC) Alternating between sending and\nattracting.\nIn the same stance with the center\nof your palm directly in contact with\nthe outside of your partner’s arm,\nalternate between sending a subtle\nvector of motion to your partner’s arm\nand attracting a vector of motion from\nyour partner’s arm. Without telling\nyour partner which you are doing,\nnotice if the arm moves or shifts in\nany way when you change from sending\nto attracting or vice versa. Can\nyour partner tell if you are sending or\nattracting? Try varying the force of\nyour exertion, the depth to which your\nvector of motion penetrates, and your\ntemporal dynamics. Are any of these\nvariations more effective in communicating\nmovement to your partner?\nSometimes, your partner might be\ncompelled by the force of your touch\nto move through space, or else resist\nthis by countering your motion with\ntheir own force in order to maintain\ntheir position in space (which, if sending,\nyou will experience as an increase\nof pressure against your hand). It is\nalso possible to exert several different\nforces with one hand on your partner,\nin order to counterbalance, harmonize\nor elaborate the movement you wish\nto convey.\nINTERMISSION\nAt this juncture, some sensitive\ntouchers may begin to feel slightly\ndisoriented, dizzy, or fuzzy-headed\nfrom the intensity of focus they are\ngiving to the interface between their\nhand and their partner. If you feel\nthis way, you can shift your practice\nfrom touching your partner’s arm with\nyour palm to touching the soles of\nyour partner’s feet with the soles of\nyour own feet, as you both lie supine\n(on your backs), feet to feet. Practice\nusing your feet as you have been\nusing your hands.\nYou might try this sequence: Send\nwith both feet to your partner, penetrating\nall the way through their legs,\ntrunk, arms and out the top of their\nhead. Next, attract with both feet so\nthat you draw your partner down from\ntheir head, trunk, legs and feet and\nthrough your own feet, and onward\nout through the top of your head.\nNow send with one foot and attract\nwith the other. Alternate so that the\nfoot that was sending now attracts and\nvice versa. Notice the effect of your\nactions on the position and motion of\nyour partner’s lower spine and pelvis.\nNow let your partner be the active\nagent Allow your entire body to\nrespond to the motion imparted to\nyour feet.\nD) Using both hands simultaneously\nin various combinations of sending\nand attracting.\nIn the following practices, you will\ncounterbalance the force exerted by\none of your hands with the force exerted\nyou will be able to more directly produce\nmotion within the internal volumes\nof your partner’s body as well as\nto perceive these motions more clearly\nas pressure changes against your\npalms.\nAsk your partner to lie on his/her\nside, or to sit on a stool or backless\nchair. Place your right palm on the\nfront of your partner’s chest and your\nleft palm opposite your right on your\npartner’s back. Send a vector of motion\nfrom your back (left) palm while\nstabilizing the front of your partner’s\nchest with your front (right) palm with\nthe intention of moving the back surface\nof your partner’s chest towards\nthe stabilized front surface, i.e. compressing\nthe volume of your partner’s\nchest from back to front slightly.\nNext, by sending with the back palm\nand attracting with the front palm,\nmove both back and front surfaces\nthrough space so that the internal\nvolume of your partner’s chest is\npreserved and the chest as a whole\nmoves forward.\nNow reverse the role of each hand\n(front hand sending and the back hand\nstabilizing, then attracting) so as to\nconvey the intention first of compressing\nthe chest from front to back, and\nthen of moving the chest as a whole\nbackwards.\nPractice sending with both hands at\nthe same time so that the chest compresses\ninward to its center like a\nballoon deflating. Attract with both\nhands at the same time so that the\nchest expands outward like a balloon\nfilling up.\nMove your hands down from your\npartner’s chest to his/her pelvis. Place\nthe palm of one of your hands on the\nfront of your partner’s pelvis (just\nbelow the belly button and above\npubic bone) and the palm of your\nother hand on the back of your partner’s\npelvis (over the top of the sacrum\nand lower spine area). Practice\nsending with each hand, first emphasizing\nthe back hand so that it conveys\na stronger vector of motion. You\nmight see the small of his/her back\nmove forward slightly. Next emphasize\nthe front hand so that it conveys a\nstronger vector of motion. This may\nproduce a slight concavity of the abdomen\nsuch that it moves backwards\ntowards your left hand.\nIn order to further explore the roles\nthat both hands working together can\nplay in reorganizing your partner’s\nbody or body parts, you might explore\nthese additional practices with your\npartner in a standing position. Put one\nhand on the back of your partner’s\nthorax (upper body) and send his/her\nthorax forward while simultaneously\nputting your other hand on the front of\nyour partner’s lower abdomen to send\nhis/her pelvis back so that the diagonal\ndistance between your palms decreases,\napproaching a vertical. Keeping\nthe same hand positions on the body,\nattract these two volumes so that the\ndiagonal distance between your palms\nincreases. [Figure 1]\nIn the first case, your partner’s\nspinal posture will probably shift to\none of greater erectness (flattening of\nthe sagittal spinal curves). In the\nsecond case, when you are attracting\ninstead of sending, you might see your\npartner assume a more slumped spinal\nposture (exaggeration of the sagittal\nspinal curves).\nIt is possible to use one hand to\nperform one of the three functions of\n“sending,” “attracting,” or “stabilizing”\nwhile the other hand does another.\nSometimes it seems that one hand is\nmore easily able to perform one of\nthese functions while the other hand is\nmore easily able to perform another.\nUsually we can and do perform at\nleast two of these functions together\nwhen we use both hands simultaneously.\nCODA\nBefore resuming your normal daily\nlife activities, it is useful to “reground”\nyourself by: walking around\nwhile focusing on the sensation of the\nsoles of your feet on the ground;\nmassaging your feet; lying on your\nback with the soles of your feet flat\non the ground and sliding the surface\nof your soles around in circles or\nfigure 8’s; walking around again,\nconcentrating on the interaction between\nthe soles of your feet and the\nground.\n\nPART II:\nIDENTIFYING\nOnce you have acquired skill in\ntouching with precise directional intent,\nyou can practice touching as a\nmeans to identify and interact with the\nindividual structures contained within\nthe body.\nTraditionally, each identifiable\nstructure in the body is considered in\nterms of its role in one of the many\nfunctional systems including : cutaneous\n(skin), fascial (connective tissue),\nmuscular, skeletal, circulatory (arteries,\nveins, lymphatic vessels and\nnodes, cerebrospinal fluid), nervous\n(brain, spinal cord and nerves), and\nvisceral (glands and organs).\nThe skill necessary to identify a\nparticular structure develops out of an\ninteraction between extensive knowledge\nof functional anatomy/physiol-\nogy/pathology and the subjective experience\nof touching the various structures\nof the body on many different\npeople over time. This long-term\npractice gives a precise dimensional\nconcept of the contents of the entire\nbody as well as an understanding of\nthe variations in conditions that can\nexist within these contents. Eventually\nthe intentional toucher begins to\nfind ways to communicate specific\nmovements which enhance the functional\npotential of the various body\ncontents. I like to imagine that movements\nconveyed through touch reveal\npathways or maps leading to the fulfillment\nof the integrity, dreams and\ndesires of the various body tissues.\nThis section is a brief review of\nthe characteristic properties of each\nsystemic structure as I experience\nthem, and of how I perceive, identify,\nand begin interacting with each structure\nthrough touch. I think of each\nbody system as having its own “language,”\na unique spatial, temporal, and\nenergetic configuration by which I\nboth recognize it and “listen” to it so\nas to learn what to do next.\nThe features that I must notice in\norder to identify both the system and\nthe specific stucture within that system\ninclude the following:\nlocation\nsize\nshape\ntemperature\ndensity or apparent hardness\nrange and direction of motion\nrhythm and speed\nconnections to or effects on other\nstructures\nnature of the response to my\ntouch\nSKIN/FASCIA\nOur skin is the largest organ of\nour body, serving the essential roles of\nboth separating and connecting our\ninner and outer worlds. The exploration\nof skin is a form of topography,\nthe study of surfaces. Our skin is\nhighly innervated, therefore extremely\nresponsive to touch. Some of the skin\nreceptors trigger responses in the deeper\nlayers of our body, such as underlying\nmuscles and even organs. (In fact,\nthis works both ways, in that an unusual\nsensation in the skin is sometimes\nbeing referred from a deeper\nstructure.)\nFascia can be easily thought of as\nthe skin for the internal body structures.\nHowever, this characterization\ndoes not suggest the awesome prevalence\nof fascia in the body. Not only\nis every structure in the body encased\nin fascia; in addition, fascia separates\nand connects each structure of the\nbody from and to every other, making\nits surfaces many-layered and extremely\ncomplex.\nIf you ever wondered what it is\nthat connects and pulls from your big\ntoe to your ear when you do an extravagant\nfull-body stretch, the answer\nis: fascia. The fascia which forms a\nfull-body stocking just under our skin\nis our superficial fascia (especially\nthick in our low back and outer thigh\nregions). There are multiple layers\nbeneath that, all the way to the fascia\nwhich surrounds our body core, i.e.,\nour spinal cord and brain. This deepest\nlayer, since it protects our nervous\nsystem, is quite tough, aptly earning\nthe name of dura.\nIn working with fascia, we can\ncontinue to use our topography model\nbut we must think of many surfaces\nlayered on top of each other (like mille\nfeuille pastry or the layers of rock and\nsand that form the earth’s crust).\n* Like skin, fascia is elastic but it is\nnot as soft. Each layer of fascia has\nits own directional pull along which it\nwill stretch more or less easily, not\nunlike woven fabric. Since it surrounds\nmuscle, stretching a muscle\nalso stretches fascia. However, muscle\nis “smart”—it has innervation to permit\nit to actively and intentionally\ncontract or not. Fascia, in contrast, is\n“dumb”—it has no motor innervation\n—therefore, the length and surface\nshape of fascia can only be altered\npassively through movement imposed\nfrom the outside.\nOne can think of the ubiquitous\nfascia as the historical record of the\nbody since its present condition reflects\nmovement and positions that\nhave been assumed by the surrounding\nstructures in the past. For example,\nlong term shortening in the erectae\nspinae muscles of the lower back will\nresult in a shortening of the surrounding\nfascia. Subsequently, a sway-back\nposture is maintained even after the\nsupporting lower back muscles are\nrelaxed. Thus, it may not be enough\nto relax and lengthen a muscle that is\ntoo short. It may be necessary to\nlengthen the fascia as well in order for\nthe muscle to be fully extensible.\nDavid was an individual who exhibited\nthis bodily configuration. He\ncomplained of fatigue or aching at the\nend of the day, while his wife complained,\n“his gut hangs out in front.”\nDavid frequently attempted to stretch\nout his erectae spinae muscles with an\nexercise he learned from a gym class.\nWhen I asked him to show me the\nexercise, he slightly bent his knees\nand curved forward as far as he could,\ntrying to let his fingertips touch the\nground. He bounced vigorously in an\neffort to reach closer to the ground.\nThis practice does, in fact, stretch (and\nactivate) the erectae spinae slightly,\nbut it did not diminish his sway back\nor his ache. In order to change his\nspinal posture and sustain greater\nlength of his erectae spinae muscles, I\ntaught him another practice which\nelongates the lumbar fascia as well.\nThe lumbar fascia stretches “on\nthe bias” from its anchorage on the\nspine where it travels around to the\nbelly, connecting the rib cage and the\npelvis. [Figure 2] In order to elongate\nhis lumbar fascia, I asked David\nto lie on his side and twist his pelvis\nforward by reaching his upper thigh\nout along the floor in front of him and\ncounter-twist his rib cage backwards\nthe floor behind him. After staying in\nthis position for a minute or two with\nmy manual assistance, he reversed the\nposition of his thigh and arm so that\nhis pelvis twisted backwards with the\nreach of his upper thigh along the\nfloor behind him and his rib cage\ncounter-twisted forwards with the\nreach of his upper arm along the floor\nin front of him.\nAfter resting in this position for a\nminute or two, he began to slowly\nswing his arm and leg in opposition,\nfrom the first to the second position.\nAt my encouragement, he gradually\nincreased his speed and his range of\nmotion. Finally, he repeated the\nwhole sequence lying on the other\nside. When he stood up five minutes\nlater, his back appeared straighter, his\n“gut” was less prominent, and he\nclaimed that the ache was gone and\nreplaced with a feeling of “lightness.”\nWhen he tried his original forwardhanging\nposition again, without bouncing,\nhis fingers touched the ground\neasily.\nMUSCLE\nOur muscles, encased and surrounded\nresponsible for producing the movement\nof our bony levers through\nspace. If the exploration of the skin\nand fascia is analogous to the topography\nof the earth, then the exploration\nof the muscles is analogous to geology-\nMuscles have depth and volume as\nwell as surface. As mentioned before,\na highly significant difference between\nmuscle and fascia is that muscle is\n“smart,” i.e., it is innervated by motor\nnerves. This means we can voluntarily\ndirect the activity of a muscle and\ntherefore affect its shape. Because it\nis smart, muscle can be altered by the\napplication of voluntary thinking/im-\nagery. I usually use spoken imagery\nas I am applying manual techniques to\nindividual muscles and muscle groups.\nIt is quite easy to alter an individual\nmuscle by working linearly along\nits surface. If you can locate and\ntouch the points of attachment of a\nparticular muscle to the bone, then you\ncan elicit voluntary elongation and\nrelaxation of the muscle by asking the\nperson to imagine those two points\nmoving apart so that the distance\nbetween the points increases. To\nfacilitate the person’s imagining (and\nelicit an additional reflexive or unconscious\nresponse in his/her muscle),\npress directly on the tendons close to\ntheir points of attachment to bone and\ngently pull the two polar points apart.\n[Figure 3]\nConversely, if the person will\nimagine that those same two points are\nmoving towards each other so that the\ndistance between the points decreases,\nhe/she can voluntarily shorten and\nincrease the level of activity of that\nmuscle. The toucher can also facilitate\nthis activity in the muscle reflexively\nquickly or using a fingernail to stroke\nagainst the direction of hair growth on\nthe skin overlying the muscle.\nThrough touch, we can penetrate to\nthe different layers of muscle. Each\nmuscle forms one layer and has a\ndifferent direction of action.\nFor example, if I am touching the\nmost superficial layer of the abdominal\nmuscles—the external oblique—on the\nright side, then the direction of action\nis from the lateral aspect of the ribs to\nthe medial aspect of the anterior pelvis\n(pubic region). [Figure 5] I can\nchange the activity of this muscle in a\nfew ways: by bringing the two points\ntogether, resulting in contraction or\nshortening; by sending the two points\napart, resulting in relaxation or lengthening;\nor by crossing perpendicular to\nthe line of the muscle, resulting in\nneutralizing any activity of that muscle.\nIf I choose to penetrate this layer\nand go one layer deeper—the internal\noblique—on the right side, then the\ndirection of action is from the more\nmedial aspect of the ribs to the lateral\naspect of the anterior pelvis, in other\nwords, perpendicular to the superficial\nlayer.\nIf I go onward to the deepest layer—the\ntransversus abdominis—on the\nright side, then the direction of action\nis from the back around to the front in\nthe direction of an elastic belt. It is\npossible to stretch out the belt, relaxing\nor elongating the muscle; or else to\ntighten that belt, activating or shortening\nthe muscle.\nOnce you know the location and\norientation of each muscle relative to\nthe others, you can penetrate to any\nlayer with your touch, using the directions\nthat have an influence at that\nlayer. It is useful to note that these\nthree layers of the abdominal wall\nmuscles are attached indirectly to the\nspine by the lumbar fascia (which I\ndescribed in the case of David).\n\nIt is also possible to work volu-\nmetrically with any muscle. In other\nwords, I can consider alterations in the\nthickness of a muscle. By focusing on\nchanges in volume, I can alter the ten-\nsion/exertion levels in the muscle, just\nas I altered the length of muscle when\nI focused on linear changes. For example,\nif I touch with the intention of\nthickening a particular muscle layer,\nthe contractile activity of that muscle\nwill tend to increase. If I touch with\nthe intention of decreasing the volume\nof a particular muscle layer under my\nfingers, there will tend to be a decrease\nin the contractile activity of that\nmuscle or an enhancement of its ability\nto elongate to its maximum length.\n\nBONE/JOINT\nOur bones are levers whose relative\nstiffness allow us to carry the\nmass of our body directionally through\nspace. All bones are spiral in form.\nIt is in the joints between the bones\nwhere the actual movement takes\nplace. The joint surfaces are always\nrounded (concave or convex). Therefore,\nmovement at any joint describes\nan arc through space. There are no\nstraight lines in this realm. We are\nworking with curved joint surfaces and\nspherical space through which the\nspiral-shaped bones arc.\nWhen we touch to produce movement\nof bones, we are actually producing\nmovement at joints, regardless\nof where the touch or imagery is\nfocused. For this reason, my focus is\ngenerally on joint movement (although\nwe may think of the bones themselves\nin order to produce movement at their\njoints).\nWhen we produce movement at\njoints, we are affecting a whole group\nof muscles. Some muscles are shortening\nto produce the joint motion;\nsome are elongating to permit the joint\nmotion to happen unimpeded; still\nothers are contracting in place to\nstabilize the bones. Even a tiny joint\nmovement produces a very extensive\nand complex muscular response. If\nworking with skin is topography and\nworking with muscle is geology, then\nworking with bones is internal astronomy:\nthe study of the orbits in a miniature\nsolar system.\nA common condition (called hallux\nvalgus), in which the big toe is\nangled inward so as to point towards\nthe second toe instead of straight\nahead, serves as a case in which the\n“orbits” of the foot are disharmonious.\n[Figure 6] In an ideal foot, the toes\neach rotate vertically around their\nbases (the metatarsal-phalangeal joints)\nin smooth arcs of motion which are\napproximately the range of half a full\norbit (135 to 180 degrees). This allows\neach toe to raise up off the\nground to point towards the sky (extension)\nand to press down and grip\nthe ground (flexion).\nThere is a second dimension of\nmotion of the toes as well. This is an\narc which allows each toe to angle\naway from the midline of the foot\n(second toe) so that the toes are\nsplayed wide on the ground (abduction)\nand then to angle towards the\nmidline of the foot so that the toes are\nall pressed together (adduction). This\narc of motion is less than a tenth of a\nfull orbit (20 to 30 degrees) but it\nnonetheless allows the foot the ability\nto significantly widen and narrow. By\nengaging both orbits of motion, each\ntoe can circumduct around its base in\na way which allows us to stabilize or\ngrasp with our foot.\nLet us consider the hallux valgus.\nIn watching a dancer named Margaret,\nwho exhibits this configuration, move\nher big toe, I see that the arc of motion\nof the tip of her toe is deflected\nfrom its path and diminished in its\nrange. Instead of moving straight up\ntowards the ceiling in line with the\nbone that forms its base (the metatarsal\nbone), the big toe meanders inward\ntowards the second toe even more, so\nthat it never actually points to the\nceiling. Likewise, if the big toe is\npressed down onto the ground or\ncurled under as if to grip a sandy\nbeach surface, it angles inward so that\nits motion is stopped by its collision\nwith the second toe.\nWhen I feel the motions of her big\ntoe with my fingers, I will perceive\nthe meandering and restricted nature\nof the joint motion. I particularly feel\nthe lack of space on the inner aspect\nof the big toe joint next to the second\ntoe (medial aspect of the first MP\njoint). With my fingers I can gently\ncreate a little more room in that part\nof the joint, so that the big toe will\nbegin to approach its ideal orbit.\nWhen I ask the dancer to engage the\nmuscle (abductor hallucis) on the\noutside of the big toe joint by imagining\nthe outer tip of the big toe moving\ntowards the inside of her heel bone\n(imagining shortening the distance\nbetween the two points of attachment\nof the muscle so as to increase its\nactivity), I may see and feel some\nchanges in the joint motion.\nI might also ask the dancer to\nimagine the inner tip of the big toe\nmoving away from the foot so as to\nmake the big toe grow very long from\nthat point (this decreases the engagement\nof the flexor hallucis brevis and\nlumbricals which tend to pull the big\ntoe into a more angulated position\nwhen it is flexed or extended). In\nthese small interactions with the big\ntoe joint and its surrounding muscles, I\nmight see some shifting of the big\ntoe’s position at rest as well as a more\nfluid orbit of motion. This shift may\nbe sustained by Margaret if she continues\npracticing it attentively as she goes\nthrough her daily activities.\nFLUID SYSTEMS:\nblood, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid\nOne can describe the movement\ncharacteristics of skin, fascia, muscles\nand bones primarily in terms of their\nspatial qualities: e.g., their changes in\nsize, shape, direction, arcs of movement,\netc. While focusing on the\nmovement of the fluid systems of the\nbody, however, it becomes essential to\nattend to the temporal aspects of the\nmovement as well.\nAs I “listen” to the flow patterns\nof these fluids, I can describe them\nwith metaphors. The pattern of flow\nthrough the blood vessels is like the\nprogression of water down a river with\na pump at one end. In contrast, lymph\nflows viscously and irregularly (at the\nimpetus of an outside force such as\nmusculo-skeletal action), much like the\ncolloidal suspension of sand and water\nthat forms the muddy bed of a swamp.\nSlower yet is cerebrospinal fluid\nwhose tides, like those of an inland\nsea, ebb and flow on an enclosing\nshore. All these fluid systems can be\nstudied in terms of the complex and\nelegant physics of fluid dynamics.\nBLOOD VESSELS. Blood is the\neasiest fluid to monitor. You can\ndirectly feel the pulse of arterial flow\nwrist, for example. Or if you lie\nquietly for a few moments, you can\nfeel your arterial pulse in all your\nextremities.\nArterial blood is pumped rhythmically\nwhose strongly-binding elasticity does\nnot allow the heart’s pulse to diffuse.\nVenous blood is pumped back through\nthe thinner-walled veins by movement\nproduced by the alternate contraction/\nrelaxation of muscles and concomitant\nmotion of joints.\nArteries are firmer than veins.\nThey are easily felt to have the characteristic\nrhythmic pulse impelled by\nthe heartbeat. Veins are more malleable,\nand their motion is a function of\nmany forces acting upon them to\npropel the returning blood through the\none-way valves back to the heart.\nThese forces include the elastic properties\nof the veins themselves, the\nelastic quality of the surrounding\ntissues, the activity of the surrounding\nmuscles, and even the elastic properties\nof clothing and other externals,\nsuch as gravity or the touch of another’s\nhands.\n\nLYMPH flow is from periphery to\ncenter, in the same direction as venous\nflow. It filters and returns to the heart\ncellular fluids not carried by the veins,\nwith the addition of dead white cells\nand other immune system sentinels,\nfighters and martyrs. It is not pumped\naround it. Since its main, central,\ndeep-level channel travels along\nthe front of the thoracic spine, the\npumping produced by breathing is\nitself a prime mover of lymph in its\nfinal progression back to the heart.\nLymphatic flow is uneven. Its viscosity,\nspeed, and rhythm are determined\ncellular health, breathing and the level\nof the body’s physical activity at the\nmoment.\nThe superficial lymphatic vessels\nhave nodes at the joints: very large\nones at armpit, base of neck and groin\nareas, moderately large ones at elbows,\nknees, wrists and ankles. These\nare quite easy to palpate (feel with\nyour hands) when there is a local\ninfection such as a mosquito bite.\nEven in the absence of any congestion,\nit is easy to palpate the relatively large\nlymph nodes at the groin in front of\nthe hip.\nWhere blood may be perceived as\nmoving quickly, lymph is slower, even\nsluggish. Where blood is more watery,\nlymph is more like mud. Where\narterial blood flow is clearly metered,\nlymph movement is not metered at all.\nWhere blood seems to have a mind of\nits own, lymph is mindless. Where\nblood is like a pulsing river, lymph\ncan be like a peat bog.\nWe have all experienced the effects\nof venous and lymphatic pooling\ndue to a sluggish return to the heart,\nperhaps when sitting for a long car\ntrip or in bleachers at an athletic\nevent. When we finally stand up, our\nfeet feel hot and thick. When we take\noff our shoes, our feet may appear red\nor mottled and the tops of our shoes\nare marked deeply into our skin. The\nthe red may be indicative of blood\npooling while the puffy swelling may\nbe indicative of the lymphatic pooling.\nElevation of our feet coupled with\nactive circling of our ankles may\nquickly alter both the color and size of\nour feet to a more familiar state.\nA more extremely uncomfortable\nsituation arises when we sit with one\nfoot folded under us during that long\ncar trip or athletic event. Then we\nhave not only compromised fluid\nreturn to the heart, but also arterial\noutflow from the heart and nerve\nsignals to the foot as a result of pressure.\nIn this case, an examination of\nthe foot will reveal a cooler and whiter\nform which experiences no sensation\nat all for a few moments. Vigorous\nencouragement of arterial flow\nand nerve signals to the foot (by, for\nexample, hopping up and down on that\nfoot) will produce the most intense\nand miserable of sensations. A more\ngradual encouragement of outflow\n(such as very light repetitive stroking\nof the foot from ankle to toes and\nmaking tiny movements of the foot)\nwill produce somewhat less intense\nsensations of “pin-pricks” or “fire\nants” as more normal flow is being reestablished.\n\nCEREBROSPINAL FLUID is the liquid\nmedium in which the brain and spinal\ncord are bathed. This fluid is encased\nin three layers of a type of connective\ntissue called dura mater, arachnoid\ndura, and pia mater. The dural sacs\nare themselves encased in the bones of\nthe skull and the vertebrae of the spinal\ncolumn. Thus, the central nervous\nsystem is protected by flotation inside\na shock-absorbing fluid medium as\nwell as by armament within the adjustable\nhard plates of cranial and spinal\nbones. The dural sac, which encases\nthe cerebrospinal fluid, attaches at\nvarious key points to the skull and\nspinal column and is itself continuous\nwith the deep fascia of the rest of the\nbody.\nAlthough we cannot directly touch\nthe cerebrospinal fluid itself, we can\ndirectly monitor its motion by placing\nour hands on the bones that its dural\nsac attaches to—the skull and vertebrae.\nThe reverberations of that motion\ncan also be monitored from any\nplace in the body—even the feet—because\nof the continuity of dura and\nfascia throughout the body.\nIn the absence of unusual influences\n(abnormal neural, biochemical, or\nmusculo-skeletal conditions), the cerebrospinal\nfluid seems to move rhythmically\nand periodically. As suggested\nbefore, we can liken the cerebrospinal\nfluid rhythm to the tidal flow patterns\nof an inland sea. “Storms at sea”\nare eventually perceivable at any point\nalong its enclosing shoreline. In attending\nto the cerebrospinal fluid, we\nare focusing on rhythms of motion\nthrough time. We may also attend to\nharmony or dissynchrony in these\nrhythms of motion when we compare\nright and left sides of the body, upper\nand lower regions, central and distal\nparts, etc.\nSuppose that I were to arrive for a\nvisit later the same day with the unfortunate\nperson who sat for a long time\non her foot. I might ask her to lie\ndown on her back to allow me to hold\nthe outsides of her lower legs and feet\nin my hands. If I waited quietly for\nseveral minutes with my fingers and\npalms touching her ever so lightly, I\nwould be able to identify the foot that\nshe had been sitting on by its diminished\ncranial rhythm—i.e., impeded\nresonance within the ebb and flow of\nthe cerebrospinal fluid. My hands\nwould feel that the outer ankle bones\n(fibulae) would be minutely rotating\nforward and backwards relative to the\nshin bone (tibia). [Figure 7] This\nminimal arcing of the fibula around\nthe tibia would take place in a very\nslow pendulum-like rhythm (slower\nthan a full breath cycle of inhalation\nand exhalation). On the sat-upon right\nfoot, I would feel a diminished range\nof motion in the fibula’s orbit and\nperhaps even a slower rhythm to that\nmotion. The fibula would travel a\nshorter distance and take a longer\namount of time to do so.\nThe difference in the two sides\nwould be subtle but palpable, possibly\nfor many hours after the mildly traumatic\nsitting event\nNERVOUS SYSTEM\nThe movement of signals along\nnerves is so rapid as to seem instantaneous.\nThis gives us the satisfying\nillusion that our brain and any particular\ncell in the periphery (say, a muscle\ncell in the index finger) are in simultaneous\nsynchrony. In fact, studies have\nshown that they’re not. Approximately\n.3 seconds will pass between the\ntime our eye sees a flash of flight and\nour brain sends an impulse to our\nfinger to move so that it presses a\nbutton.\nUnless a nerve is severely inflamed\n(as in sciatica), we normally\ndon’t feel the nerve itself, but only the\nresult of its transmissions: we feel\nsensations such as temperature, pressure,\npain, and itch due to transmissions\nfrom the periphery to the spinal\ncord/brain; we produce movements of\nour bones through space due to transmissions\nto the muscles from the\nspinal cord/brain.\nWhile nerves transmit impulses via\nelectric currents, these currents are\nthemselves affected and altered in\nterms of intensity, speed, duration, and\nspatial pathways by the continuous\nchanges in production by the brain of\nspecialized chemicals called neuro-\ntransmitters. The relative concentration\nof these chemicals at any given\nsite within the nervous system at a\nparticular moment is contingent on\nsuch factors as previous experience\n(i.e., learning), level of alertness,\nfatigue, overall health, emotional and\nhormonal states, as well as the amount\nand type of stimulus being received by\nthe brain at that moment.\nEven the simplest neurological\nresponse involves millions of nerve\nsynapses (connections between nerves\nacross which impulses are transmitted).\nAny action can be thought of as\na vast orchestral performance or temporal-spatial\nweb of interactions within\nthe nervous system. There are many\ndifferent instruments in the orchestra\nand each one plays its score of varying\ntones in various sequences through\ntime, but the music is the summation\nof all the instruments together.\nThe web of interactions within the\nnervous system is incredibly elaborate\neven when we are performing the\nsimplest motion. When I think of\ninteracting with the nervous system, I\nlike to imagine that I am listening to a\nsymphony. The brain of the person I\nam touching is the conductor of the\nneural symphony. As audience, I can\nbe observant, appreciative, and critical.\nIf the person I am working with, the\nconductor (Til call her Sonia), is interested\nin changing or enhancing the\n“symphony,” she will have to become\nconsciously aware of what my hands,\nas audience, are conveying. If I have\ngained Sonia’s attention, then a few\nwords coupled with the most minimal\nspatial and temporal directions from\nmy fingers can have a significant\neffect on her entire nervous system.\nFor example, Sonia suffers from a\ndegenerative neurological syndrome\nwhich causes the left side of her body\nto be weaker and less sensitive than\nher right. The difference in her two\nsides is not constant. Sometimes she\nwill experience almost equal sensorimotor\ninnervation to both sides. Other\ntimes she will be severely debilitated\nfor months on end.\nOne day at the swimming pool,\nshe asked me to observe her crawl\nstroke. She was going through a\nperiod of marked debility in which\nswimming was the only activity she\ncould enjoy. However, she noticed\nthat she had difficulty staying in her\nlane and was constantly bumping into\nthe rope to her left side. What I saw\nwas that her right arm always reached\nforward more strongly and with more\nsustainment while her left arm seemed\nto merely follow through. I told her\nwhat I was seeing with the comment\nthat I suspected this to be a result of\nher neurological disability. To my\nsurprise, she expressed surprise at my\nobservation. She told me, “I feel as if\nI use both arms equally when I swim.”\nIn response, I suggested that we try\nan experiment. I asked her to imagine\nthat her left arm had to move through\nsomething denser and more resistant\nthan water. As I said this, I lightly\nresisted the movement of her left palm\nforward through space with my own\nhand, as if my hand were the water.\nShe followed my suggestion during her\nnext lap and immediately exhibited a\nmore symmetrical stroke. When she\narrived at the end of the lane, she\nexuberantly announced that she hadn’t\nrun into the rope even once. She said,\n“Now I feel like I’m doing everything\nwith my left arm, and it feels good.”\nWe continued to swim at the pool\nevery day for the rest of the summer.\nNow that she was giving more of her\nattention to her left arm, she was able\nto swim in a more symmetrical fashion.\nThe sensory loss induced by her\nneurological condition had allowed her\nto “forget” her left arm and therefore\nto not use it even as much as she was\nable. Although her medical condition\nwas unchanged, she was able to engage\nher brain to give more stimulus\nto her left arm and thereby more integrated\nfunction to her whole body.\n\nORGAN AND GLANDULAR\nSYSTEMS\nOrganic function can best be understood\nwith a detailed awareness of\nspatial location, tissue texture, temporal\ndynamics, and the complex interactions\nbetween each organ/gland and\nanother.\nGlands are characterized by their\nability to secrete a substance which\ncan be carried (usually via the circulatory\nsystem) to other locations in the\nbody. Organs are characterized by\ntheir specialized ability to carry out a\nfunction which alters or processes\nsubstances which pass through them.\nAny variation in the amount and/or\ntype of secretion produced by a particular\ngland can have effects on each\nand all the other body systems in\nelaborate ways. Any shift in the processing\ncapacities of a particular organ\ncan likewise result in adjustments and\nchanges within all the other body\nsystems.\nIncreased activity in one organ/\ngland can produce decrease in its\nantagonist organ/gland, and vice versa.\nThus, it is not desirable to simply\nstimulate what is “underactive” or\nsoothe what is “overactive.” Because\nof these complex interactions, I let the\nglands/organs “tell” me about themselves,\nbut I do not “talk back” or\nintervene except to remove external\nimpediments to their balanced functioning\n(such as tight clothing, muscle\ntension, joint rigidity, etc.).\nGenerally speaking, a healthy\ngland/organ feels soft, movable, and\nnot easily distinguished from surrounding\nsoft tissue. For example, a\nhealthy thyroid gland (snuggled\naround the “adam’s apple” or thyroid\ncartilage) can barely be palpated when\nit moves up and down along with the\nadam’s apple in swallowing. It is\nusually like a soft padding to either\nside of the cartilage. However, when\nit is inflamed (as in thyroiditis) it will\nbe hot and the overlying skin will be\nred. When it is enlarged (with goitre)\nit is visible as a large bulging mass\nfilling the space between the chin and\nthe sternum. It may even have a\ngrainy texture like tapioca if it has\nnodules growing in it.\nWhen I am working with someone,\nan organ or gland may “call out” to\nme strongly by resisting my motion,\nfor example. My hands can then respond\nby: (1) identifying the specific\nvisceral “shouter”; (2) removing impediments\nto its full function—i.e.,\nrelease surrounding muscle spasm, reduce\nrigidity, stasis, pressure, interrupt\npain when possible, etc.; (3) balanc-\ning/integrating the body system as a\nwhole to support integrated function.\nAlthough my actions do not directly\nmake an infirm organ or gland resume\nits normal functions and secretions,\nmy hands might inform a healthy\norgan or gland about conditions of\ngreater ease and mobility.\nSummary\nI sense skin and fascia as surface\n—topography. I perceive muscle as\nsurface and volume—geology. Skeletal\njoints are characterized by orbital\nmovement—astronomy. The fluid\nsystems of blood/lymph/cerebrospinal\nfluid are identified by the rate and\nrhythm of their directional linear\nflow—fluid dynamics. I can only\nbegin to comprehend the complex\npatterns of the nervous system if I\nthink orchestrally. The glandular/\norgan systems are perceivable in complex\npatterns over long diurnal cycles\nand biorhythms which I must run at\nfast-forward through my memory in\norder to gain a sense of them.\nThe kinds of things that I “hear”\nskin and fascia telling me about are\nelasticity and extensibility (or restriction).\nMuscle tells me about extensibility\nas well as contractility. Joints\ninform me about their surrounding\nmuscles and also about their intrinsic\nmobility (or stiffness). Fluid systems\ntalk about rhythm (or arrhythmia),\nspeed, dilation (or constriction) of the\nvessels which carry the fluids, viscosity\nand congestion. The nervous system\ntells me about communication\nchannels, synthesis and webs of functional\ncontrol. The glandular and organ\nsystems talk about resilience (or hardness),\nadaptability, long-term complex\ninteractions.\nTo perceive each system, I find it\nuseful to “talk” to it by sending/attrac-\nting vectors of motion to, from and\naround it The movement I convey\nthrough my hands initiates a kind of\nkinesthetic conversation with the various\ntissues of the person I am touching.\nAs I move responsively, always\nsending and attracting, I begin to\nunderstand what a particular group of\ncells is “telling” me. Eventually, I\nchoreograph more complex and\nlengthy sequences of motion with my\nfingers in interaction with those cells\nto present new possibilities for movement\ninteractions with other structures.\nIf I send with one hand on either\nside of the pelvis, I can identify and\ninteract with all the body systems\nwhich compose that volume contained\nbetween my hands. My front hand\nmight be sending the psoas muscles\naway to relax against the front of the\nspine, thus allowing the kidneys and\nintestines to fall backwards into the\nabdominal cavity so that the surface of\nthe abdominal wall becomes more\nconvex under my hand.\nMeanwhile my back hand can be\nsending the lumbar vertebrae forward\nso that each intervertebral joint moves\ninto a position of greater extension.\nThis will increase the height of the\nintervertebral discs, thus decompressing\nthem while opening the spaces\nthrough which the nerve roots pass in\nand out of the spinal column to communicate\nwith the lower limbs. My\nback hand could also be sending the\nerectae spinae muscles forward to\nrelax against the back of the spine. If\nI lower my back hand slightly so that\nit is resting on the sacrum, I might\ngently add to the ebb and flow of the\ncerebrospinal fluid (whose rhythm\nreverberates all the way down to the\nfeet).\nIf I choose to simultaneously send\nwith both hands so that they not only\nmove towards each other but also\nslightly upwards towards the person’s\nhead, I might affect other fluid systems\nsuch as the lymphatic trunk\nwhich carries the lymph from the front\nof the hip joints to the heart. If I keep\nsending with both hands with increasing\npressure as the person exhales,\nI will force the abdominal contents\nupwards against the diaphragm,\ncausing it to dome up as far as possible\ninto the thorax. This will allow\nthe lungs to expel more air, increasing\ntheir usable volume. I can induce\nmovement in each body system contained\nbetween my hands by varying\nthe location, pressure, force, timing\nand depth of my touch while sending.\n[Figure 8] The motion induced can\nbe elaborated even more if I combine\nsending and attracting touch.\nGenerally, I perceive a system to\nbe at ease when there is vitality, rhythmic\nmovement and harmony. I perceive\na system to be under duress\nwhen it resists movement, is distinctly\nhot/cold, rapid/slow, arrhythmic or\nutterly still. In other words, if a particular\nstructure is yelling or singing\ndissonantly, then I pay very careful\nattention to what it has to say. If I\ncan understand it, then I can “sing\nback” with my hands through the\nbasic actions of sending and attracting\nas an informed intentional toucher.\nIncluding verbal communication further\nclarifies and facilitates the touch\ninteraction.\nThrough intentional touch, I hope\nto engage all of the body systems of\nthe person I am touching so the parts\ncan perceive mutually harmonious\nways of moving, and the person can\nachieve greater freedom to function\nadaptively throughout life.",

It’s parallel,\nor simultaneous, how when for\nothers you are, so too, for your Self,\nyou are. Compassionate and forgiving.\nVividly I recall the incident at Breit-\nenbush ’93 when a massage person\nallegedly violated a client “...in an\nunwanted sexual manner at the end of a\nmassage” (Karen Nelson in Still Moving\nlast issue). “Allegedly,” because his\nversion of the incident was not heard, as\nhe was excluded from the Contact Community\nmeeting the following day where\nI felt he was accused, tried, judged and\nsentenced. Many were screaming and\nstomping and banging the walls and\ncrying and vehemently venting hostility.\nLots of judgment; not much forgiveness.\nLots of anger; not much compassion.\nEven for the massage client. This\nincident truly has the feeling of “the real\nworld.” The culture is strong on abuse\nand catharsis and violence. You can\nalleviate your own guilt by burning the\nwitch. She is the One keeping God\nfrom You.\nThe American ethos, educational\nsystem, and media are rife with incidents\n(50% of all tax dollars still goes\nto fund the military). Is there not some\nthing(s) other underneath the concepts\nof Defense and Abuse, Good Guys, Bad\nGuys, Them or Us, Shes and Hes? Or\nis this relentless, cultural gravity? It is\nhistorically massive, with such great\nmomentum, and clear-cuttingly out of\ncontrol. What to do? How to shift,\nalter, undermine—some way—to change\nIt. And create space for different values—gentler,\nforgiving, supportive,\ncompassionate—to emerge, and take\nroot\nTowards this end I wrote the performance\nHERESY.

We should also agree\nthat we can potentially disagree\nabout everything else, and act with\nthat in mind. Hopefully, each person\nrealizes the intent and extent of\nthe situation and willingly engages\nthemselves.\nKaren Nelson\nVashon. WA\n\n\nCOMMENTS ON ETIQUETTE\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, we have had\nregular jams for a couple of years with\noccasional jams, classes and workshops\ngoing back to the late 1970s. When\nanother c.i.’er comes through Atlanta\nwe often schedule a special jam to have\nthe opportunity to dance with this visitor.\nWe usually ask the new dancer to\nshare their background/techniques/medi-\ntations with us, as we share ours with\nthem.

We enjoy experiencing\ndifferent ways of approaching\ncontact improv. I’ve taught many contact\nimprov workshops and classes but\nI don’t go into someone else’s community\nsaying, “I am a teacher, I want to\nteach a contact improv class.” Instead\nI say, “I jam, can I jam with your community?”\nI think of this as good etiquette.\nThe joy of contact improvisation is\nsharing movement. One dancer does\nnot manhandle another. There is an\nintense interaction in contact improvisation\nthat includes trust, giving\nweight, lifting, etc. The cornerstone of\nthis interaction is a dialogue between\ntwo individuals who acknowledge the\nright of the other to be and move. I\nsmile when the social context that surrounds\njams and the flow of dancers\nthrough the community reflects this\nprincipal. I invite dialogue.\nHeitzo\nAtlanta, GA",

    "Content": "harbin is such an amazing experience—so\nmany people in so little space,\ni am told that warmer weather makes a\nvery different jam. winter means cold,\nwet tenting, sleeping in a big room with\nmany other bodies, or spending big\nmoney on private rooms, i am with my\nlover and we are into multiplicity—two\npublic nights in the big room, three\nnights of private, wet, tenting and one\nnight in a hotel-like Harbin Hot Springs\nroom.\ni have agreed to facilitate a discussion\nabout sex and contact improvisation\nwith julie oak. we are both very tired\nbut know it’s important to provide space\nfor such a talk, i want activity, something\nexperiential which will start people\nin body and in immediacy, i am\ncurious about boundaries—what they\nare, how we recognize them, how our\ndancing alters them, how dancing\nboundaries differ from social boundaries\nor sexual boundaries.\ni ask the assembled group to form\ntwo lines, one on each side of the room,\nfacing each other, we will do a boundary\nwalk, each person has a partner\ndirectly across from them, they make\neye contact, one line is still while the\nother line slowly comes across the\nspace, the moment a still person feels a\nshift, of any kind, they ask the mover to\nstop, this is very primary—about sensing\nboundary and identifying changes,\ninitially, the still person uses hand signals\nto stop the mover, then i encourage\npeople to use their voices, it is very\nstrong to hear people say the word\n“stop.” we do this boundary walk in\nthe main space and then we move to\nsomeplace more private.\nabout 25 of us squeeze into a tiny\nroom called The Guru Room, a place\nfor massages, private time, special projects.\na suggestion is made that we\nbegin by formulating questions, then we\nfollow whatever issue seems hottest,\nultimately, i am sorry that we took this\ntack, the very activity of formulating\nseems to squeeze the life out of almost\nanything, right away, we step back\nfrom whatever edge we might have been\non. nobody realized at the time that\nthis decision might be dulling, the\ngroup was large, our time was limited\n(1.5 hours) and we might have gotten\nbadly bogged down without some structure,\nbut i wonder if our immediate\nneed for structure arose out of fear.\nhere are the questions that were\nformulated and some of the comments\nwhich were offered during open discussion:\n• what is the difference between sensuality\nand sexuality? what is arousal?\n• as the community grows, are our\nsexual boundaries expanding?\n• how should our community handle\naccusations of sexual impropriety?\n• how should our community deal with\ncharged emotions around sexuality?\n• if you get a crush on someone, do you\nmention it? when and how? (starting to\nsound like seventeen magazine...)\n• how does our practice of contact\nchange our sexual/touch boundaries in\nthe world?\n• where are the gays and lesbians in Cl?\n• is there a line beyond which sexual\nexpression becomes inappropriate?\nwhere is that line?\n• what are our values and assumptions\nbased on gender?\n• are there emotional dynamics at a jam\nwhich stimulate the need to couple (or\nto sex) as a survival technique?\n• are standards for sexual appropriateness\nin the dance different for publicly\nrecognized “couples”?\n• to what extend should/do values in the\nCl setting differ from values in the\nlarger community?\n• how do community judgements about\nsexuality affect a person’s standing in\nthe community?\n• there was a desire to hear stories\nconcerned with communicating about\nsexuality in the dance.\n(major side track: a fascinating and\nblaring sub-issue has to do with this\nmuch-used word COMMUNITY. are we\none? what defines us? what are our\nvalues? does everyone who studies\ncontact improvisation belong? is membership\nimmediate?)\nthis is a random smattering of comments:\n• there seems to be a difference between\nsensual and sensory, many people have\nsensory experiences while dancing\nwhich are somehow more analytical\nthan sensual experiences which seem to\narise from within.\n• we were all very curious about the\nidea of experiencing sexuality without\narousal, the whole concept of arousal\nbecame an interesting pivot, how is it\ndefined? does this change a dance from\nsensual to sexual? from appropriately\nsexual to inappropriately sexual?\n• in the dance, some people experience\nsexuality but not in standard forms,\n(hmmm)\n• there was some talk of intention and\nattention, what are we doing in the\ndance and where is our focus? is sex a\nfocus? some people actively channel\nenergy into non-erogenous zones, some\nof us wanted to know where these\nzones are located.\n• the topic of safety and sexuality was\nraised, this included discussion of how\nmuch is too much (sexiness?) and how\nthis shifts sooo much from person to\nperson, dance to dance, some dances\nfeel sensual and sexual and this can feel\nlike a violation while some dances feel\nsensual and sexual and this feels great,\nthis experience of violation was more\nrecognized among women present\nthough there were at least one or two\nmen who reported similar experiences.\n• we tried to define violation and some\nthought it centered around being\ntouched with a sexual intent, another\ninteresting idea is that violation is onesided\ncommunication.\n• then, in my notes there is something\nlike this:\n• there was an attempt to define maturity\nas an ability to deflect or manage\nenergy, this was not a universally accepted\ndefinition.\n• it was pointed out that within the\ncontext of Cl, it is possible to touch as\nmuch as we might want to and that this\nsharply contrasts experience in the larger\ncommunity. this discrepancy is\nsometimes troublesome and confusing.\n• it was generally agreed that the intimacy\nof contacting and the making of\nintimate contact bring up many people’s\nissues instantly, we did not agree about\nwhat these issues were exactly.\nwe were hungry and dinner was\nabout to end so we concluded, on the\nwhole, i was most satisfied by our willingness\nto sit as a group and even begin\nsuch a discussion, nothing earthshat-\ntering happened but i am patient, mostly,\nwe need to find ways to stay with\nthe juice, in the juice?, and stay out of\ntoo much intellectualizing. this is\ntricky, even with sex.",

    "Content": "It starts with a crossing over\nfrom street to studio that is sometimes\ngradual and unlabored and sometimes\ndirected by meticulous intention.\nUpon arrival, I listen for my breath,\nacknowledge any discomfort in my\nphysical body and acknowledge my\nmood, energy, the degree of distraction\nor presence. Before entering motion, I\nstrip down to stillness as a dock from\nwhich to set myself adrift. I begin to\nexplore pathways, seeking familiarity\nto ground myself, and also trying to\nexperience them as if for the first time.\nOnce I am grounded, motion tingles at\nthe end of my limbs, then seeps into\nthe limbs themselves, and finally\nwashes into my spine. From this\nplace, I am seeking an initial rhythm,\nknowing it may take on many shifts as\nI move.\nThese small motions of arrival can\nlead me directly into a duet, or they\ncan loop me back into a second tier of\nstillness. What is consistent, in either\nexperience, is the meticulous listening\nto both internal and external fields of\nsensation; if I feel the heat of another\nbody, if I feel hesitant to connect, if I\nfeel insecure as I approach someone or\nif I feel trust, an invitation, a desire to\nspeak my inner voice through touch.\nThe substance of each dance is\nmultifaceted. In dances driven by\nkinetic impulse, flight, suspension, and\nphysical abandon intersect with a\nwildness in me that is unencumbered\nhold less imagery; the weight exchange\ndoesn’t pour down into my\ninternal chambers. These dances are\nmore peripheral emotionally; instead,\nweight reveals itself as a luscious tool\nfor aerial exploration. Energy becomes\nthe guide and though I am still\nin my body, I give myself over to this\ncharge as it rushes through pathways\nthat are completely random, unpredictable\nand subsequently delightful.\nThen there are other dances, whose\nsubstance draws from internal reserves.\nThese dances give me a window into\nmy own complexity, as they start in\nmy heart and grow outward. These\ndances more often begin in stillness; if\nI am in a place of grieving, I am more\nlikely to have this kind of dance.\nSorrow becomes liquid and pours out\nfrom the folds between my bones. If\nit is current, its pouring is reckless;\nsmouldering. If sorrow stems from an\nold wound, it has the texture of a\nresidue—rough, colorless, sometimes\nbitter from age. Heart dances are\nsmaller dances spatially, and yet larger\nin terms of exploding open those\nmicroscopic places in the body that\nstore memory and one’s depth of\nexperiences.\nHeart dances lend themselves to\nnarrative. Imagery enters and transports\nme to an altered time and place.\nA story unfolds. I am myself and also\na character drawn from an altered\nstate—a voice that does not surface\neasily in the conscious world, but that\nfinds an opening through the rhythm\nof the dance. I feel my creativity on\nfire in these moments. I feel deeply\nconnected to a power that is often\nunspoken and buried in me. I feel\nconnected to my partner—knowing we\nare sharing an experience and that our\nattention and presence are streamlined\ninto a single focus—but knowing too\nthat our imaginations are pulling from\nvastly different sources, hence our\ndance may contain many stories.\nHeart dances come for me only\nwhen I feel a great deal of trust. I\nhave had heart dances with strangers,\nlovers, and those in between. This\nleads me to an understanding that trust\nin the dance does not come from\nknowledge of a person per se but from\npresence—from meeting up with\nsomeone who embraces time and\nspace and motion as a sacred frame\nfor seamless listening.\nI also experience dances that pass\nin and out of heart dances and kinetic\ndances while keeping a through-line\nthat connects each segment into a\nunified whole. These blended dances\nare nonlinear; their shifts cannot be\nmapped out There is a certain\nrhythm of exertion and rest, but I\ncan’t predict the places where my\nheart will come through until it actually\nwinds its way into perceptible sensation.\nAs with any relationship, I cannot\ngive my trust unless I know my own\nboundaries. My practice of contact\nimprov has helped me learn this vital\nlesson. I have had dances where I felt\nan impending sense of violation because\nI have not known how to honor\nmy own voice. The dance has given\nme a chance to witness the gaps in my\nown process of claiming power. For\nexample, ending a dance. Feeling a\nneed to disconnect and yet not\nspeaking that need, verbally or nonverbally.\nAnd so feeling over-run by a\ndance that has taken me beyond where\nI want to go. My shortfalls with\ncommunication have burrowed deeply\ninto my body, hence the dance is a\nstory teller; a mirror on the wall. Its\nfables are ancient, timely, and bursting\nwith metaphor.\nI cannot hide when I am dancing.\nAt times I try to hide, and in these\nmoments I tuck my body into a cold,\nsightless state—attached to nothing\nvital or alive. In the purest dances,\nthough, the intricate demands of physical\npresence disallow hiding and\nmotion becomes a tool for seeking the\ntruth of who I am.\nIn contact, I value listening, willingness,\ncuriosity, laughter, the investment\nof one’s emotions. I also value\ncarefulness. At times I am fragile to\nthe point of breaking, but still I want\nto connect with someone, to feel a part\nof something. It is a great challenge\nto trust that a partner can hear my\nfragility, as there is a certain terror in\nthe vulnerability that ensues. It’s not\na state of being I seek out willingly.\nAnd yet it emerges again and again.\nIf I find myself ignoring the vulnerability\nstored in my body, then I am cut\noff from a part of my vitality and the\ndance loses potency. Dances that\ncontain this kind of internal betrayal\nare marked by artifice. They do not\nempower.\nStretching beyond artifice. This,\nabove all, is what I value in the\ndance... Finding a place of authenticity\nin the multifaceted combinations\nof hand upon shoulder, shoulder skirting\nunderneath hips, hips upon a ledge\nof the spine... Finding a universe of\nwisdom through the layering and unlayering\nof one body with another...\nFinding heart, fire and grace among\nthe tossing and tangling of ligaments,\ntendons, and bones.",

    "Content": "INTRODUCTION\nAt the ’93 Memorial Day\nweekend Harbin Hot Springs Jam, a\nseries of scores and informal classes\nrefined a polarity I have been toying\nwith for some time: the cohesion-noncohesion\ncontinuum.\nCohesion is loosely defined as sticking\ntogether, to varying degrees, as if\nglued. In some cases, while dancing\nContact Improvisation, one partner\nseems to hang in an impossible position\nas if glued to a spot on their partner. In\nother cases, there is articulation at the\npoint of contact that allows the supported\nperson to rotate like a wheel on that\npoint of contact. Still other cases have\na moving point of contact that is sustained\nindefinitely. Contact would not\nbe contact without cohesiveness. Clinging\nis a form of excessive cohesion.\nNoncohesion is the tendency for\ndancers to separate. This can happen in\na number of ways. If the point of contact\nis seen as the center of a wheel, as\nthe wheel spins, centrifugal forces can\ndirect the dancers apart. The force of\ngravity, when it exceeds the resistance\nof friction through the point of contact,\ncan also cause separation. Additionally,\nthe spontaneity of the dancers may lead\nthem into “distancing” themselves from\neach other as part of the improvisation.\nNoncohesion can have an evasive quality\nto it when one or both of the partners\nfor whatever reason does the “I-don’t-\nwant-to-touch” dance; this would be the\nopposite of clinging.\nFor me, balance in a contact improv\nis an ebb and flow of cohesion and\nnoncohesion, bonding and unbonding,\nintegration and disintegration.\nThe following events during the jam\nfed into my materializing concept.\nof about 35 people are wandering\nthrough a rectangular space. At the\nsound of a chime everyone secretly\npicks a protector and an attacker. Then\neach person moves in such a way as to\nkeep the protector between them and\nthe attacker. This looked like two or\nmore epicenters that would catastrophically\nform, disintegrate and reform until\nthe chime sounded again. (This looked\nsomewhat like an exercise Robert Ellis\nDunn did with the classes at the Naropa\nInstitute where a group of dancers\nwould wander through the space until\nsomeone yelled “Swarm.” The instigator\ncould spiral in place or streak across\nthe space gathering the others, forming\nglobs of dancers or swirling rivers\ndepending on their movement.)\nA second score was suggested by\nanother participant where the roles\nshifted at the sound of the chime. The\nattacker became the protector and vice\nversa. Visually, it looked the same, but\nmore dynamic.\nWhat I saw in these scores was the\ncohesion-noncohesion continuum in\ncollective space; one would stay relatively\nclose to or bonded to the protector\n(cohesion) and keep a maximum\ndistance from the attacker (noncohesion).\nIn free form improv, balanced cohesion\nand noncohesion is seen as ease\nand flexibility in movement in and out\nof the life space, or kinesphere, of the\npartner(s). With a stronger cohesion\npreference, the partners would look\nmore like ballroom dancers and stay\nroughly the same distance apart or\nrelatively tightly bonded within their\nshared kinesphere. With a stronger\nnoncohesion preference, a duet would\nmanifest more as two solos with more\ndistance between the partners.\nKarl Frost’s Attackers/Protector\nScore\nKarl organized a score that relates\nnicely to the chaos discussions in the\nlast issue of CQ. In the score, a group\nPreference by Body Region\nCohesion and noncohesion get further\ncomplicated as body parts manifest\ndifferent tendencies toward cohesion\ndepending on skill, fear, physical injury\nor psychological injury associated with\nthe body part. The simplest example is\nphysical injury. A limb or torso injury\nwill generally cause evasive behavior on\nthe part of the dancer if the partner\napproaches the injured area. Emotional\nor sexual taboos related to a body part\ncould also cause evasive behavior.\nNoncohesion may result from lack of\nskills or due to a lack of feeling or\nawareness in parts of the body. One\nmay choose to move quickly past rather\nthan linger in positions where one feels\nnothing or uncomfortable.\nIsabel Fine’s Resistance/Passive\nScore\nIsabel did a morning group score\nwhere, in a duet, one partner would\nresist the partnering in any way they\nwanted. As the resister, I found myself\nmoving through space gently but forcefully\nmaintaining the integrity and direction\nof my dance regardless of my\npartner’s activity. When the roles shifted\nI found my partner evading contact\ncontact. Another partner avoided all\noffers of support.\nThis becomes very interesting to me\nin the context of an undirected improvisation.\nThere are some dancers who\nfeel and look as if they playfully skirt\nthe boundaries of cohesion in order to\ncreate surprise. There are others that\nevade with certain parts of their body\nfor reasons stated above. Then there\nare those who are excessively cohesive\neither wholly or body part specific; I\nsee this in the single male in pursuit of\na female more so than in any others.\nStill others create the dance by clearly\ncommunicating a cohesive surface or\nledge in the context of a dance; the\npartner may or may not take the ledge\nbut the opportunity is clearly communicated.\nMartin Keogh’s Spinning Vertical\nPost Exercise\nAt Harbin, Martin did a lab on flying.\nOne of the exercises was as follows.\nOne partner would spin around\ntheir central axis, in a standing position,\nwhile his/her partner would attempt to\njoin the movement of the spinner in\nphysical contact by seeing and “aligning”\nthemselves with the movement.\nThe spinner maintains a relatively rapid\nspeed and direction regardless of the\nattempts of the partner to join. The\nrelative disregard that the spinning post\nshows to the aligning partner appears\nnoncohesive.\nA more obviously cohesive modification\nwould be to have the spinning\npost “align with” the other, in this case\nmeaning to offer a surface or a ledge to\nthe joining partner just as they meet.\nThis brings up an important aspect of\ncohesion and noncohesion, namely the\nalignments or adjustments made in a\nduet.\nIn Martin’s lab, the exercise preceding\nthe spinning post was one of intentional\ncohesion. One partner, sitting on\nthe floor, would start to roll backwards\nthen rock forwards to pop up to a forward-moving\nwalk. The aligning partner\nwould meet the rising partner’s\nshoulder just at the transition from\ncrouching level to low standing, then\nride the rise to standing and be lifted off\nthe floor. Here the partners stage a\nmeeting place where they can play with\nthe possibilities at the meeting point.\nThe shoulder of the rising partner is the\noffered ledge, an obvious cohesive gesture.\nThere are pros and cons to cohesive\nand noncohesive orientations. Many\nveteran contacters that I have danced\nwith seem to prefer the excitement and\nrisk in contact dancing that favors cohesion\nthat occurs as an offerless random\nevent. It’s the synchronistic event or\nrandom occurrence of a ledge and the\npartner meeting that ledge that seems to\nfire their imaginations.\nCohesion as an Attractor and\nStabilizer\nWhen partners move together, presenting\nsurfaces or aligning in ways that\noffer clear lines of support, the surfaces\nor ledges act as attractors. The supporting\nsurfaces of the dancer are somewhat\nlike the ionic surfaces of molecules.\nThe visual alignment with and physical\nmovement toward surfaces resembles\nbonding or cohesion. When the alignment\nis visually ignored or physically\nevaded, the dance takes on a tentative\nquality with more brief and accidental\ncontacts or bondings. The effective\ncommunication of surfaces or ledges\nseems to stabilize the dance in that the\nsmoothness and length of the bonds are\naccentuated.\nBut there seems to come a time in\nwhen the smoothness and length of\nbonds are not enough; over the course\nof time, clear communication and exchange\nof roles becomes too predictable.\nAt this point some dancers seem\nto introduce a kind of clever randomness\nto the improvisation. Surfaces are\ncommunicated in a purposely tentative\nmanner as a kind of challenge: “Can\nyou do anything with this!?” “Sure!\nCan you do anything with this?!” Such\ncontact dances are the jazz of contact\nwhere the smoother form seems more\nlike the waltz of contact.\nNoncohesion, Point of Contact\nVariations, and Changing Levels\nStrictly moving from offer to offer\nin an exchange of supporting roles can\nlook and feel a bit monotonous. Thus\na certain amount of unpredictability or\nchaos in the dance can lead to delightful\nsurprises.\nThree familiar ways of introducing\nvariety are noncohesion, variations in\nweight through the point of contact, and\nchanging levels. My background is free\nform improv so I enjoy maintaining a\nlink with my partner through non-touch-\noriented gestures, which is a free form\nskill. Thus as I find myself in a nonco-\nhesive event I communicate with my\npartner through hand, body, facial, or\nleg and foot gestures. Much variety is\nintroduced, after partners have separated,\nin the exploration of paths back\ninto contact.\nMuch can be added to a dance by\nvarying the weight through the point of\ncontact. My teacher, Darshana Ellis,\nback in 1987 had us do variations\nthrough the point of contact as a percentage\nof body weight: 10% as light\ncontact, to 100% as fully supported. Of\ncourse, one can put 100% body weight\nthrough only a limited set of supporting\nledges. Putting more weight through a\nledge than it can bear can cause nonco-\nhesive events.\nChanging levels also adds immeasurable\nvariety to contact dance. The\nhigher the level of support, i.e., the\nshoulder or extended arm of a standing\npartner, often the more precarious the\nperch. Finding cohesive pathways from\nlevel to level is part of the wonder of\ncontact improv.\n\n\nAxes of Cohesion and\nNoncohesion\n\nThere are many axes of cohesion\nand noncohesion. One obvious one is\nphysical discomfort (injury or weakness).\nA person with an injury will\noften keep an “air-cushion” around the\ninjury so that any movement towards\nthe injury causes an evasive maneuver\nsomething like putting two magnets\ntogether at the same poles. Similar\nmaneuvers can be seen if one partner\nhas sexual/sensual discomfort, intimacy-\ndistance issues, or softness-hardness\npreferences (martial/controlling versus\nsoft/flowing).\nOne can playfully impose an axis in\na dance and explore. Typically the use\nof the hands is taboo in contact interaction\nfor beginners so that they can learn\nto be present with the rest of the body.\nThus the hands would be playfully\nevasive and the rest of the body cohesive.\nIn Martin Keogh’s spinning post\nexercise, the spinning post is being\nplayfully noncohesive by purposefully\nnot aligning with the joining partner’s\nattempts to find a ledge. Here the non-\ncohesiveness is more attitudinally than\nphysically motivated.\n\nPercussive Contact in the Context\nof Cohesion and Noncohesion\nIt is interesting to see the effect of\nvariations in cohesion-noncohesion on\nthe percussiveness of a dance. When\ntwo partners both go to meet the point\nof contact forcefully, a kind of percussive\nor concussive impact can result.\nTwo cohesive partners may never have\nany space between them for a percussive\nimpact to take place. If one person\nis cohesive and the other is evasive, you\nsee a cat and mouse dance that can have\npercussive impacts when the cohesive\npartner finally makes contact with the\nevader. Mismatches in cohesion-noncohesion\npreferences may lead to the\n“misses” and percussive impacts with\nthe third partner in all duets—the floor.\nContacters seem to get smoother and\nless accidentally or unconsciously percussive\nwith experience.\nTwo Types of Control: Cohesive\nand Noncohesive\nTwo poles of the control continuum\nhave cohesive and noncohesive components\nas well. The cohesive controller\nwill stay in close proximity to the partner\nand direct the dance through the\npoint of contact The noncohesive controller\nwill control the dance by moving\naway or keeping a certain permissible\ndistance. Radical examples of these\nforms of control are: (1) the dancer who\nhas only one pressure through the point\nof contact (full force!), and (2) the dancer\nwho is feather light and never really\nthere in a supportive way for the partner.\nBear in mind that there is no criticism\nintended in these descriptions,\nwhere I am is always the place or envelope\nfrom which I may continue to\nlearn. The cohesive-noncohesive continuum\nis just another construct for examining\nand articulating preferences that\naffect the form that a dance takes.\nContact Etiquette\nAt Harbin, Julie Oak organized a\ncontact etiquette discussion. In this\ndiscussion I realized that my dance with\nany new partner involves a sampling\nprocess wherein I test the cohesion-\nnoncohesion boundaries of my new\npartner. Then, after establishing the\nboundaries, I linger in the permissible\nzone and see what I can do in playing\nwith and between the permissible safe\nspaces. It’s not unlike sculpting: I do a\nrough cut of the okay-space then refine\nthe sculpture as the dance continues,\nexploring nuance, but above all honoring\nboundaries. When I touch or get\nnear an evasively loaded body part, it\noften creates wobble or the instability\none feels when the same poles of two\nmagnets are brought together. Energetic\nnoncohesion creates an instability that\nprovides (provokes) risk and surprise in\nthe tumble to find a stable configuration\nagain. Thus I have evolved an etiquette\nthat (1) seeks to establish the boundaries\nof acceptable points of contact and (2)\nbalances cohesion and noncohesion\ndynamics within these boundaries.\nBlind Spots\nI don’t think that everyone is aware\nof their cohesive-noncohesive tendencies.\nI know that I am unaware of my\nown except in fleeting moments here\nand there. I think it’s much easier to\nsee someone else’s patterns than my\nown, hence working with this continuum\nwould be best approached with a\npartner or teacher/observer who is familiar\nwith the continuum and can point\nout the ease or difficulty in making\ncontact wholly or body part by part\nTeaching\nIn teaching contact, I demonstrate\nthe basics of cohesion and noncohesion\nalong with other skills. In the process\nof demonstrating cohesion and noncohesion\nin an exercise I point out excessively\ncohesive or noncohesive maneuvers,\nfirst to be sure there is consciousness\nof the behavior, and secondly to\noffer opportunities to explore options.\nThus I ensure awareness of alternatives.\nOften beginners will have unconscious\nevasive maneuvers like the gap\nbetween the chest and the hips that\nresults in “scoots” or jumps from chest\nto hip versus a smooth rolling point of\ncontact through chest to tummy to hip.\nExperiencing touch on a previously\nunconscious part of the body can range\nfrom delightful surprise (“Oh! I didn’t\nrealize I could do that!”) to more therapeutic\nexplorations (“Gee, that’s a bit\nscary.”). In all cases of dread associated\nwith certain body parts, I personally\nhonor the memory stored there. Typically,\nwith time, the untouchability\nheals and diminishes as a student deepens\ntheir exploration of contact improvisation.\nIn my efforts to deepen my own\nexplorations, I have a basic pattern that\nI follow. My problems in flow have\ntwo basic discontinuities: too cohesive\nor too noncohesive. In both cases the\nexploration is similar.\nIn teaching, if I find one of my students\nstuck or too sticky in certain\nplaces, I put the student in that stuck\nplace and introduce noncohesive elements\na little at a time to unbond the\nglue that they seem to have in that\nplace. We explore various flowing\nroutes from that stuck place to other\nstable configurations. Typically each\nroute will have its own difficulties\nwhich, when practiced, smooth out and\nbecome unconscious competencies.\nConversely, if I find myself or one\nof my students scooting or jumping\nevasively over some place in the dance,\nthen that noncohesive spot can become\nthe subject of an exploration. I find\nways to linger in or introduce cohesive\nalternatives within the context of the\nnoncohesive spot. We move together\nfrom various stable cohesive places in\nthe dance to and through the unstable\nnoncohesive spot in such a way that we\nbecome consciously skillful in our interactions\nin and around the noncohesive\nspot. Eventually through drills and\nplay, the unconscious scoots and percussive\nimpacts disappear.",
