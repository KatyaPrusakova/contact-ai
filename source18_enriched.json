That's a big long dance.\nI'd like to bring your attention to a\npeculiar truth that currently exists: Con-\ntact Quarterly is, at the moment, neither\nquarterly nor a magazine about Contact\nImprovisation. This may be obvious to\nmany of you and surprising, even\nshocking, to others. Though there's\nsomething appealing to me about keep-\ning the name and just changing inside it,\nour continuing to use the name Contact\nQuarterly for this magazine is more\nthan misleading, it's becoming a real\npain in the neck: too many subscribers\nare wondering if they've missed some\nissues, and many would-be subscribers\nare missing out altogether because they\nthink they have to do Contact Improvi-\nsation to read CQ. This journal you\nnow touch and that touches you, is\nsomewhere between Contact Quarterly\nand a new place.\nOne of my dancing curiosities of late\nhas been focused on the life cycle of\nform in improvised movement-how\nform is first perceived, recognized,\npursued and how it changes.\nhappens when individual fragments of\nawareness add up to the perception of a\nunity, offering an overall shape, charac-\nter or form to the present activity. Is it\n\npossible to perceive forms for which we\nhave no conscious reference, to perceive\na unity arising that we've never felt\nbefore? And supposing it is possible,\ncan we also consciously perceive its\ndecay, dis-integration, end, with the\nsame clarity, even excitement, with\nwhich we experienced it \"coming to-\ngether\"? How, from within the apparent\nlack of form, can we see the new orga-\nnizing structure emerge? This is one\nthing in dancing, and it is the same in\nmaking this magazine.\nContact Quarterly's first year of life\nwas as a Sx/year typewritten xcroxed\nContact Newsletter, circulated among\nthe nationally scattered group of teach-\ners and practitioners of Contact Impro-\nvisation. It then went through 3 years\nof being a 4x/yr Contact Quarterly, still\nlargely by, for, and about Contact Im-\nprovisers and their work, and proceeded\nthrough 13 years of a 3x/yr Contact\nQuarterly stretching further each issue\ninto new realms within the contempo-\nrary dance and movement arts arena.\nMeanwhile, we continue to be a vehicle\nfor the CI community as well as for the\nexpanding dance community that has\ngathered within and around CQ's cov-\ners. It is probably true that Contact\nQuarterly today is more about contact\ninspiration than contact improvisation.\nThough I personally have been and\ncontinue to be deeply involved in Con-\ntact Improvisation, the \"Contact\" in\nContact Quarterly has for me always\nbeen essentially about contact, ex-\nchange, between people whose bodies\nand minds are moving.\nThe desire to remain curious, to lear\nand exchange, has brought us to this\nparticular juncture: We are a biannual\nmovement journal called Contact Quar-\nterly that has grown past the borders of\nits name.

    "Abstract": "This article recounts the 4th Festival de Danza Posmoderna in Caracas, Venezuela, highlighting the cultural exchange between international dance artists and Venezuelan students. It emphasizes the role of David Zambrano in fostering this exchange and the festival's impact on introducing new dance techniques and improvisation to the local dance community. The author reflects on the students' enthusiasm and the integration of Venezuelan culture, particularly salsa, into postmodern dance explorations.",
    "Content": "The 4th Festival de Danza Posmoderna\nin Caracas, Venezuela was held from\nFebruary 3 to March 14, 1992. A total\nof 11 dance artists from the U.S., Eu-\nrope, and Venezuela were invited to\ncontribute their teaching and perform-\ning. These included myself, Marguerita\nGuergue, Jackie Shue, Karen Nelson,\nK.J. Holmes, Ishmael Houston Jones,\nLance Gries, Bo Madvig, David Zam-\nbrano, Paco Macia and Jeremy Nelson.\nThe festival is funded by the Consejo\nNacional de la Cultura, Venezucla, the\nSuitcase Fund of Dance Theatre Work-\nshop in New York, the Rockefeller\nFoundation, and various schools and\ncompanies in and outside of Caracas,\nwho actively involve their staff and\nstudents.\nI was curious about the growth of\n*new dance' and 'post-modem' dance in\nVenezuela, since I had been there last in\n1962 (l) dancing with the José Limon\nCompany. I had always wanted to go\nback.\nDavid Zambrano, Venezuelan danc-\ncr-performer, based in New York but\nworking all over the globe, is the motor\nand the heart of this yearly festival. All\nduring the festival, David's spirit and\nenergy were truly remarkable, whether\npicking up newly arrived guest teachers,\ntranslating interviews, showing the\nwhereabouts of studios in the city, or\nbuying groceries, David would be there\nand take care of things with elegance.\nDavid runs the fectival in close\ncollaboration with the Instituto Superior\nde Danza, a school that offers ballet and\nmodern dance classes, for beginners to\nprofessionals, and is the birthplace of\nseveral Caracas-based dance companies.\nThe Instituto, located in a busy, dirty,\nindustrial arce,\nwith noisy traffic,\nformed an axis far teachers and students\nin the late afternoon, to meet and talk.\nIt was like an oasis, with its white walls\nand large tropical piants. The school\npublishes its own magazine, La Danza,\nfor which the guests were interviewed\nThis year the Instituto celebrated its\n10th anniversary.\nThe format of the festival is an open\nwork form. Schools and companies that\noffer traditional ballet and modern dance\nclasses during the year open their doors\nto otherwise inaccessible ways of dance\nmaking, techniques, skills, improvisa-\ntion, and choreography. David claims\nthat his dedication to improvisation\ncomes from not being able to remember\nset choreography, but I suspect that it\noriginates with the salsa in his blood,\nand as such is at the root of the creative\napproach of this festival. The learning\nsituation is a creative one; students are\nstimulated to think, feel, and sense, to\nexplore and expand their own resources.\nA strong factor in the success of this\nformat seems to be the students' enthu-\nsiasm and desire for this self-emancipa-\ntory information. They are not shy and\nshow an eagerness to understand and\nexperience the body in new ways.\nFor the guest artists there is a cross-\nfertilization between the open, direct,\nand very physical, tropical energy (of\nthe salsa) and the listening-to-the-body\nas a basis for action, underlying the so-\ncalled post-modern work. Inspired by\nthe students, I wanted to learn the salsa\nand was surprised how easily the moves\njust seemed to come from the earth and\nthe music once you set foot on the\ndance floor.\nIn the various attempts by the news-\npapers to clarify the issue of \"what is\n'post-modern dance\"?\", there was never\no n e a n s w e r. The invited artists, with\ntheir individual qualities, perhaps have\none thing in common: the search for\ntheir own forms of dance, and perfor-\nmance of improvisation as part of that\nquest. The students I worked with were\nyoung and showed a remarkable open-\nness for experimenting with new ways\nof thinking about the body and/or han-\nding movement. It was exciting when\nI would communicate (in Spanish) ideas\nsuch as coming to a sense of breathing\nand widening in the movement, rather\nthan going from position to position,\nand I saw a clear change in their movement .\nIn a warm-up before class, one of\nthe girls from the company wanted to\nknow whether I was teaching them a\nspecial method of warming up. Since 1\ndon't believe in \"method,\" or \"style\"\nwith a patent on it, I answered with a\nthoughtful \"no,\" but further explained\nthat the practice of lying on the floor,\n\"seeing\" the spine from the inside,\nallowing weight to fall and spread with\ngravity and breathing, freeing the joints\nand \"thinking spaco\" into the body's\nstructure, all within the first exercises,\nare a conditioning for a state of sensitiv-\nity of the mind/body. So, I actually\ncould have said \"yes.\" Seen from more\ntraditional dance training, in which the\nbody's outward condition and shape is\nthe first concern, such a way of working\ncould be seen as a different approach or\nMy performance at the end of the\nthird week, TWO TRACKS, needed to\nbe structured into its Caracas form.\nDavid found me an excellent saxophon-\nist to work with, Rodolpho Reyes.\nenjoyed the change of genre that Rodol-\npho presented me with, his background\nbeing more classically jazzy or melodic\nthan Luc Houtkamp's, the Dutch saxo-\nphonist I work with, whose sound I hear\nas more rugged, non-melodic and textur-\nal-two totally different worlds.\nfound a workable form in Rodolpho's\nusing my movement as a score. He\nneeded to know durations and I asked\nhim not to follow my dynamic, but to\nonly have landmarks and stillnesses and\nbuild his own dynamic, so that we could\neach create our own track. This version\nof TWO TRACKS became a relentless\ndance and music piece; no plot, no\nstory, just movement and music in dia-\nlogue through silences. And slightly\nabstractly humorous.\nI completed my stay in Venezuela\nwith a few days off in a small beach\nvillage, down the coastal mountains\nnorth of Caracas. Huge birds, diving\nfor fish, swallows the size of the largest\nseagulls of the North Sca, a blue sky\nand a blazing hot sun on an almost\nempty beach with the clearest water and\ncoconut palms for shade, these were the\nsurroundings. One free soul climbing a\npalm tree with hands and fect, came\ndown with a large green coconut, which\nhe offered me to drink. Swimming and\nsunning, I drank more than a volume of\ninspiration for new events.\n\nAmsterdam, Holland\nAugust, 1992",

    "Abstract": "This article is a personal reflection on Irmgard Bartenieff's impact on the field of movement studies, particularly her emphasis on internal body connectivity. The author shares memories of working with Bartenieff, highlighting her unique ability to ignite curiosity about the interconnection of self, others, and the world. It emphasizes the lasting influence of Bartenieff's personal qualities and her contributions to Bartenieff Fundamentals.",
    "Content": "When I saw Irmgard Bartenieff's\nphotograph in Contact Quarterly\nlast year, a shiver of delight ran\nthrough my body. I again felt her\nvitality and life energy. I was\nreminded that perhaps there might\nbe many readers for whom the\npicture would also revive mero-\nries...and also many readers who\ncould only marvel at the curious\nwoman in the pictures, but might\nnot actually have been touched by\nher.\nFor the last five years I have\nbeen writing a book about my own\nwork with Bartenieff Fundamen-\ntals! One chapter in the book is\nabout my memories of working\nwith Irmgard. What follows are\nexcerpts from this chapter. I offer\nthem in hopes that people who have\nstudied Fundamentals and those\nwho haven't will be inspired to\nknow that the life of one individual\ndoes make a lasting difference in\nthis everchanging world. Irmgard\nis part of our collective history as\nmovers. If you are concerned about\n\"connectivity\" in your own body,\nyou have received an inheritance\nfrom Irmgard.\n\nRudolf von Laban's seminal\nwork in the first half of this century\nidentified and illuminated the con-\ncepts of Effort, Space, Shape, Action\nof Body Parts, and Group Relation-\nships as elements which describe how\nhuman beings express themselves\nthrough movement. But until his\nstudent, Iringard Bartenleff, brought\nthe perspective of her own work from\nphysical therapy to the Laban frame-\nwork, the Laban work lacked a full\nbody component. Emphasizing the\nimportance of internal body connectivity\nin making movement come alive both\nwithin the individual and out in the\nworld was Irmgard's unique contribu-\nton to this work\nThe field of Laban Movement Stud-\nles has broadened immeasurably since\nher pioneering work, but it was cer-\ntainly her \"touch\" which initiated\nwithin the field a curiosity about the\npossibilities of the interconnection of\nself to self, self to other and self to\nworld. She ignited the exploratory\nfire. And because \"Information\" does\nnot exist without the filter of the per-\nson through which that information is\ngiven, Irmgard's own personal quali-\nties became part of what one values\nand studies in Bartenieff Fundamen-\ntals today. Since I am not a historian,\nI will provide insights from my own\nand others' personal memories rather\nthan attempt a strict historical ap-\nproach.\nIrmgard was a spry 67 years old\nwhen I met her in 1967. Because I\nwas a psychology major, Lucy Ven-\nable, then president of the Dance\nNotation Bureau where I had gone to\nfinish my certification in Labanota-\ntion, sald, \"If you're interested in how\npeople express themselves, you\nshould study Effort-Shape.\"\ngard was the master teacher of it at\nthe time, I essentially apprenticed\nmyself to this sprightly young-old\nwoman for the next nearly 15 years,\nuntil her death in 1981.\nI am reminded again and again of\na typical scene...\n\nIn my mind's eye I see Irmgard,\nwith her grey hair tied back by a pastel\nchiffon scarf at the nape of her neck.\nMy memory lens opens more and I see\nwe are involved in one of our on-going\ndiscussions about movement, exploring\nconnections within the body. Sudden-\nly, she springs alive with a new\nthought. Her seemingly frail body\nbecomes immensely energized as her\nexpressive hands begin pouring out and\naround, gently touching a murititude of\nplaces in the air, spreading and open-\ning as she says, \"Well, you see, there\nare many possibilities!...\n* Her eyes\nare twinkling and her head tilting\nexpectantly, as if the complex interrela-\ntionships indicated by her round, all-\nencompassing gesture are enough to\nconvey the totality of her thought. She\nis waiting for me to respond, eager and\nchildlike, waiting for me to \"take the\nball and run with it.\nAt these moments I felt inspired,\nready to open myself to take in more,\nto feel the mystery, the potential, the\nmoving connection between things.\nthoughts, bodies—-whatever we were\ndiscussing. She would elaborate, I\nwould follow, playing in her swirling\nthoughts.\nWe had a delightful, accepting\nrelationship. We were like grand par-\nent/ grandchild colleagues. Each of us\nwas allowed to be who we were in\nour eccentric imperfect way yet with\nmaximum love and appreciation. \n\nI came into the Laban work young, at\nage 18, and was already steeped in\nthe structural side of the system,\nLabanotation, by the time I met Irm-\ngard when I was 22. Other people in\nthe early Effort-Shape training group\nwere a bit older than I and viewed\nIrmgard as a mother, sometimes\ngood, sometimes bad. What they saw\nas the \"Bad Mother\" (the one who\nwas confusing and somewhat non-\nrevealing and non-validating yet\nalways implying *You can do\nmore...there is more to learn,\") only\nspurred me on to find my own per-\nsonal clarity to bring to my co-teach-\ning with her. She could then be free\nto do her global-thought-wanderings,\nfollowing her rich, intuitive, indirect\nprocess through the class, and I could\nbe counted on to follow up with pin-\npointed questions or succinct explana-\ntions. Now, twenty years later, I find\nmyself revelling in the broad implica-\ntions of movement training. wanting\nto work at the meaning level, and\nbeing less interested in specific drills\nor one-facet descriptions. Perhaps it\nIs a stage in the creative process or\nperhaps it is an inheritance part of\nthe \"genetic line.\"\nIrmgard was an integration of what\nmight at first seem to be a mass of\npolar opposites-a magical child\nspringing into the air unexpectedly\nand a wizened old woman padding\naround the Laban Institute in house-\nshoes...a delicate frail-looking assem-\nblage of bones capable of yanking\nstudents around with fierce power...a\nhighly poetic spirit delving into analy-\nsis of specific joint functions. She was\neager to know all, and impatient that\nall was not already known. Her eyes\nwere alive, bright, and sparkling in\none moment, her face drained, in\nneed of replenishment, in the next.\n\nShe was highly discriminating yet all-\nembracing of diversity.\nHer lightness and indirectness\nmasked her inner intensity on first\nviewing. She was not \"easy\" yet she\nwas also non-confrontational. To\nIrmgard the point of an exercise or a\ndiscussion was always obvious from\nthe movement itself. When skeptics\nwould bring up baiting questions\nabout either the movement or the\nphilosophy behind the movement,\nrather than engage in a discussion or\nargument, Irmgard would begin to\nmove and say something like, \"But\nyou see, if you do it this way...*\nwhile moving either herself or the\nquestioner. If the question still re-\nmained, she frequently raised her\neyebrows, shrugged her shoulders\nand waved away the webs of disbelief\nwith her hands as if to say, \"Oh well,\nyou can think that if you want...since\nyou haven't yet found your answer in\nthe moving.\"\nFor Irmgard, movement, not more\npondering, is what brings new\nknowledge. I have come to see this\nas the activation of pre-conscious\nknowledge and have myself recog-\nnized that our bodies contain knowl-\nedge which is not accessible by ordi-\nnary linear intellectual probing. Mov-\ning and a willingness to perceive the\nmovement brings access to bodily\nknowledge, or embodiment. In this\nway, the feeling component of\nthought is brought to life, enabling\none to experience the feeling that\nconnects thoughts. Frequently, mov-\ning reveals the nature of the relation-\nship between ideas-the pattern of\nthe contexture, or the interweaving of\nparts. In her manuscript, \"The Art of\nBody Movement as a Key to Percep-\ntion,\" Irmgard states: \"The main object\nof all this material is to suggest addi-\ntional modes of perceiving yourself and\nthe world around you, using your live\nbody totally—-body/mind/feeling—as a\nkey to that perception. The heart of\nthat 'liveness' is movement and, there-\nfore, it is the movement itself that we\nhave studied. How your body func-\ntions in movement-Body/Effort/\nShape—and what that means to your\nperceptions and expression.\"\n\n\"Activate and Motivate,\" the words\nof her first physical therapy teacher\nthe late George Deaver, were passed\non to us as a motto for teaching, \nIrmgard was action oriented. She\ncould get almost anyone moving, yet\nher teaching was certainly different\nfrom traditional dance training,• With-\nout explaining why we were to do the\nmovement or really how to do it, she\nmight explode full force, do three\nstamps into the floor, run lightly for-\nward, and end in a low, wide stance\nwith a loud \"Ha!\"\nWe would stand incredulous,\nwatching this strange lady commit\nherself totally and we would be al-\nmost dumbfounded when she would\nturn around in eager expectation\nwondering why we weren't already\nmoving. (Most of us dancer-types\nwere waiting to get the counts and be\ntold some technical aspect to attempt.\nThese were not forthcoming.) Then\nshe would yell, \"Well, do itl\" and we\nwould be galvanized into action...\nstamping, running, and jumping into\na squat, \"Ha!\" At this point we were\nstill mystified as to exactly what all of\nthis would do for us, but were some-\nhow willing to attempt it in the belief\nthat there was an underlying method\nto be discovered. We had been\ntrained to imitate, but Irmgard dis-\ncouraged that. \"My movement is not\nfor you to imitate, but to speak to\nyou, to get you started.\"* She moti-\nvated us consistently through Effort—\nthrough images and the dynamic\nquality of her voice-but she might\nnot at that moment indicate what\nconnections to notice. For example,\nwhy, in terms of \"body connectivity,\"\nwere we using the strong/direct effort\n\"Hal\"? Only gradually did we make\nthe conscious association that using\nthe weight effort facilitates the proces\nof finding the heel-sitz bone connec-\ntion. This connection, in tum, facili-\ntates a stable grounded state, which\nprovides a foundation for lower\nbody/upper body integration.\nYears later in a certification faculty\nmeeting, Irmgard enjoined us as\nteachers to provide a class that is\n\"fully rich in experiencing contrasts\nrather than sorting out concepts. It\n(the class) should be evocative in the\nmoment rather than teaching' theo-\nretical material. It should send high\nenergy into a physical concentration.\nIrmgard's classes were full of large\ntotal body movement! Later genera-\ntions of teachers of Fundamentals\nstressed the floor exercises as the\nprime definers of Fundamentals, but I\nalmost never experienced an entire\nclass of Irmgard's lying on the floor.\nWe took time to go \"inside\" but then\nwe worked with moving through\nspace, experiencing shape change in\neach plane, using our voices as a rich\nsupport. We definitely spent time on\nthe floor, but we always \"played\" in a\nvery dynamic way with our own\nexpression in the environment. Irm-\ngard knew that adults need time to\ngo back to the \"baby\" patterns, but\nthat the real change is confirmed in\nthe personal phrasing that occurs\nwithin the context of one's own life,\nintegrating the new connection into\nlarger movements.\nEffort, Shape, and Space are all\ninroads to neuromuscular repat-\nterning. In almost every class that\nIrmgard taught, there were wide\nswings in dynamic range and in spa-\ntial complexity. We were vibrating\nwith our sounding, and we were\nflying and falling! I was astounde\nthe first time I saw Irmgard come\nfrom a running start and dive into the\nfloor on a diagonal. She claimed that\nshe was \"riding the kite tension\" and\nadded, \"the space will hold you.\" I\nhad my doubts, but decided that if\nsomeone nearly 50 years older could\ndo it, so could I. After a couple of\nbruised knees I discovered that, in-\ndeed, clear spatial intent to ride the\ndiagonal would open pathways to a\nmotor pattern for the body to fulfill\nthat intent. I was hooked into this\nway of training-Action! Moving\nwith intent is the key.\nI entered Irmgard's classes as a\ndancer, along with many therapists,\nanthropologists, and educators, be-\ncause we all wanted to move and\nknow about movement in a way that\nconnected us to ourselves and to\nother human beings.\nIrmgard was a founder of the\nAmerican Dance Therapy Association\nand was acutely aware of the psycho-\nlogical implications of movement.\nAfter watching a client/therapist\ninteraction from behind a one-way\nscreen, she frequently astonished the\ndoctors at the hospital of the Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine by pre-\ndicting new progress in therapy sev-\neral sessions in advance of its con-\nscious emergence in the verbal cli-\nent/therapist interaction.\nObserving the movement of one-\nself or others is a touchstone to\nknowledge. This is a simple state-\nment with profound implications for\nour society.\nIrmgard was constantly learning,\nbecause she was constantly perceiving\nmovement. She taught us to do the\nsame-to do as Laban said simply,\n\"to pay more attention to human\nmovement-bodily and mental\nwhich is obviously at the basis of all\nhuman activity.*\" This enchantment\nwith perceiving movement led to her\nwillingness to experience what was\nhappening with a particular client and\nbe excited about what was there to\nwork with, rather than conoelving in\nadvance what \"should\" be there.\nWhen 1 asked George Bartenieff,\nIrmgard's son, what he thought set\nIrmgard apart, he said, \"Well, other\ntherapists are always trying to fix\npeople. She never tried to fix anyone.\nTo her, working with someone was\nlike an adventure the two of them\nwere on together. She was fascinate\nand curious about what would happen.\nPractitioners of Fundamentals who\nare also psychotherapists frequently\nutilize movement within the context\nof a verbal therapy session. Con-\nversely, movement therapists often\nspend quite a bit of time within a\nsession encouraging the client to ver-\nbalize feelings which are coming up\nin the movement. I do not practice\ntherapy, but in the Fundamentals\nclassroom, I encourage students to\nbring movement-engendered feeling\nto a conscious level either to share out\nloud or to record in their own jounals. \nI believe in integrating the pre-\nconscious and the conscious. Irm-\ngard, however, rarely did this either\nwithin a class or a private session.\nWhen I once asked her what she did\nwith psychological \"ahal\"s which\ncame up during a session, she said in\na deliberate voice, as If casting a spell,\n\"We go back to the movement.\" This\ndedication to action over verbalizing\nwas ever present. Activate and Moti-\nvate!\nIrmgard's motivational skill has\nalready been mentioned, but it needs\nfurther discussion. In talking with\nfitness trainers and aerobics teachers\nfrom the New York Sports Training\nInstitute?, Irmgard stressed the impor-\ntance of stimulating the movement\nmotivation for repetitive skill-oriented\ntasks-not just warming muscles or\nfalling into \"the mistake of the ma-\nchines.\" In jumping. for instance, for\nit to be effective body training there\nmust be \"the desire to jump like 2-\nyear-old children—really jump with\njoy! Animate people more to move\nand out of that comes the desire to\nAnd how is that done? A nearly\nsure-fire way is to involve more of\nwho they are. For some people this\nmay mean involving their vocalization\nto engender full breath and dynamic\naliveness. For others it might be\nfinding a poetic image that feels per-\nsonally right, for others perhaps it\nmight be the proprioceptive inroad of\ntouch. Still others need to be told the\nprinciple they are working on an\nthen be left alone to problem-solve.\nIrmgard's motivational gift was to\nknow instinctively which to use.\nSomewhere in my training in Psychol-\nogy, I remember reading a famous\nexperiment where images of partial\ncircles were briefly flashed on a\nscreen and subjects were to indicate\nwhat they had seen. A huge percent-\nage completed the figure in their own\nbrains and said they had seen \"a\ncircle.\" Sometimes I feel Irmgard's\nsomewhat secretive nature was also a\nmotivator for her students. In the act\nof being not quite totally revealing of\nthe steps in her thinking process\n(which infuriated some students), she\nprovided a chance for students to\n\"complete the circle\" themselves.\nIrmgard also motivated through\nmovement which was clearly phrased,\nand therefore easier for the neuro-\nmuscular system to perceive. In my\nmemory I hear her, \"Te, te, te, te, da\"\n(four light upward steps, one widstrong \ndownward one). Phrasing was\nclarified through singing it. Poetic\nimages and metaphors were abun-\ndant..\"your palm is the heart of your\nhand. Use it with free flow and let it\ncaress the air.** Or when students\nwere having difficulty with sustained\nstrength, \"You are a slow Chinese\nMonster!*\nI can still feel the strength and\npointedness of her touch in the class-\nroom. She yanked, pressed, or pulled\nuntil I was willing to do. For instance,\nshe didn't want me to miss the de-\nlightful rotary change in the shoulder\njoint that happens when doing subtle\nrotation of the arm, so she yanked me\nthrough it—a bit like a Balinese mas-\nter teacher who is determined that the\nstudent will experience the move-\nment. With other people she guided\ngently. Each was different.\nIn individual work with patients,\nIrmgard also employed connective\ntissue massage, a manual technique of\n\"therapeutic pull\" as originated by\nFrau Elizabeth Dicke (1929). It aims\nat reworking the elastic movability of\ndifferent tissue layers against each\nother (dermis, subcutanea, and fascia).\nThis aspect of actual intervention in\nthe tissue could release habitually\nblocked areas of tension and relieve\npain, thus freeing the neuromuscular\npathways for being receptive to new\npatterns. The clarity of Irmgard's\nstrokes could also leave propriocep-\ntive messages about pathways of\nconnectivity which the individual\ncould then utilize as a movement\nm o t i v a t o r.\nIrmgard was not a great believer in\nendless repetition for skill building (as\nis frequently done in a traditional\ndance technique class). She felt that\nsuch repetition was deadening to the\npersonal involvement because most\nrepetition does not adequately em-\nphasize the reinvestment of effort\nenergy, or personal commitment, that\nIs really necessary for continued re-\ncreation of the movement. For this\nwe did repeat similar exercises or\nexperiences frequently within a long\nseries of classes.\nIrmgard Bartenieff did not set out\nto develop a theory of body connec-\ntivity or fundamental movement\ntraining. In fact she was not primari-\nly a theoretician. She worked with\npeople, with human beings. Out of\nyears of spontaneously adapting her\nknowledge of the body, art, educa-\ntion, and therapy to dealing with\nhundreds of specific people, she came\nto a way of working that worked for\nher and addressed the concerns of the\npeople and the culture in which she\npracticed\nWhen I first studied with her in the\nmid-1960s, the work was called \"Cor-\nrectives.\" She was coming out of a\nperiod of doing physical therapy with\npolio patients who were unable to\nmobilize themselves, to get their\nweight going. She had also been\nworking with dancers who were mus-\nele-bound and overly concerned with\nmaking shapes, rather than moving\nfully through space. And as a thera-\npist, people she worked with were\nnot fully functioning or were injured\nand wanted help to \"correct\" their\ncondition. Our culture had not yet\nrediscovered the significant role of\nmovement and the body in living a\nfull life (no one was jogging or danc-\ning for health reasons). Most people\nwho considered themselves intelligent\nidentified their intelligence as being in\ntheir head. There was a definite\nmind-body split in the cultural collec-\ntive and that was coupled with a\nhighly goal-oriented society. This led\nto a predominance of people in the\nculture who were reaching for things\n(ideas, thoughts, success).\nThis societal norm manifested in\nthe body as an overuse of the upper\nbody reach pattern, which frequently\nwas not supported by the push from\nthe lower body, or connectedness to\nthe ground. What polio patients\ncould not achieve because of illness,\nothers could not achieve for a multi-\ntude of other reasons.\nOriginally, \"Correctives\" was re-\ndressing a condition in our society at\nlarge and in Individual members of\nthe society. That condition was: over\nidentification of ourselves with the\nupper body and a dis-identification\nwith, indeed a deadening of, the\nlower body. Addressing this upper/\nlower split was of prime importance\nto Irmgard, as was rediscovering a\nrelationship to the center of weight,\ngrounding, and getting the lower\nbody moving. This is why there is an\nemphasis in her work on exercises for\nthe lower body and on upper/lower\nconnectivity through diagonal patterning\nEventually Irmgard became uncom-\nfortable with the title \"Correctives\"\nbecause she realized that she was\nreally giving people a chance to expe-\nrience, or re-experience, movement\nthat is basic to all human beings. Her\nown impulse was to confirm what is\nfundamental rather than correct\nsomething that was wrong. In the\nlate 1960s she began calling this work\n\"Fundamentals.\" But still there was\nno written \"theory.\"\nStudents pressed her to systemize\nthe Fundamentals work into some\nstandard form. Irmgard was resistant\nto this because she was constantly\nlearning herself, and what she empha-\nsized one year in her teaching might\ntake a whole new slant the next year,\ndepending on what she had been\nexploring in the intervening time.\n1 remember when she came back\nfrom Hawaii and was totally en-\nthralled with successive movement\nthrough the pelvis and lower body (as\nseen in the hula), or when she spent\nalmost an entire year stressing arm\nrotation through palm facing (after\nworking on an anthropological pro-\nject). This was quite inspiring to me\nas a budding teacher and made the\nidea of teaching even more exciting.\nThere were definitely core prin-\nciples which she utilized, but I do not\nthink she ever really articulated the\nfull core of those fundamental truths.\nI have spent many years trying to for-\nmulate them clearly myself and have\na chapter in my book which deals\nwith my latest list of these Principles.\nThe list includes principles such as:\n1) The whole body is connected; all\nparts are in relationship; 2) Intent\npatterns the neuromuscular system;\nclarity of intent enables your body to\nfind the motor pattern to fulfill that\nintent; 3) Movement happens in\nphrases; the preparation and initia-\ntion of the phrase determine the en-\ntire course of action for the phrase;\n4) Movement patterning, like life, is\na uniquely personal journey, an\nadventure.\nIn the early 1970s, Irmgard, Kedzie\nPenfield, Ellen Levine, and 1 met\nregularly on Saturday mornings to\nattempt to put some of the material\ninto written form It became clear\nthat irmgard needed a full-time col-\nlaborator, who was a writer, to work\nwith her on her life's book She even-\ntually found Doris Lewis and they co-\nwrote the manuscript, \"The Art of\nBody Movement as a Key to Percep\nion,\" which contained a great deal\nabout the Fundamentals work. I was\ninvited to read and comment on the\nmanuscript, which I did, and I have\nutilized numerous quotations from it\nin my own book.\nUnfortunately, most of the state-\nments about Fundamentals were de-\nleted from the final published book,\nBody Movement: Coping with the Envi-\nronment. This was extremely unfortu-\nnate because in the original manu-\nscript Irmgard discussed how her\nwork was based on a thorough under-\nstanding of the early patterns of neu-\nrological development, including the\nearly reflexes, righting reactions, and\noh an at the cong hond\nequilibrium responses, as well as the\nimportance of breath, core-distal con-\nnections, and patterns in spinal, ho-\nmologous, homolateral, and contra-\nlateral movement. With Irmgard,\nstudents of Fundamentals received\nbodily training in this work through-\nout their training. It was, however,\nnot Irmgard's style to delineate the\ntheoretical background. This work\nhas been beautifully expanded and\nenriched in recent years by Bonnie\nBainbridge Cohen, once a student of\nIrmgard's.\nAlthough irmgard was trained as a\nphysical therapist, was totally conver-\nsant with anatomy, and had shelves\noverflowing with scientific books, she\nrarely spoke anatomically. If pushed,\nshe would discuss a \"kinetic chain* In\nmuscular terms, but she preferred to\nuse her knowledge in action or refer\nto the concept in an open-ended way.\nShe used \"bony landmarks\" as refer-\nence points in her hands-on work\nrather than spending time teaching\nspecific muscle kinesiology. For in-\nstance, she might briefly mention \"the\nfan of the outward rotators of the\nthigh\" and then proceed immediately\ninto helping a student locate through\ntouch the bony landmarks of the\ngreater trochanter and the ischial\ntuberosity (sitz bone). The student\ncould then experience the excur-\nsioning of the greater trochanter com-\ning around and down nearer the sitz.\nbone as outward rotation of the thigh\nhappened at the femoral joint. This\nway of teaching was again action-\noriented —two bony landmarks chang-\ning spatial relationship\nHer own muscle knowledge al-\nlowed her to easily facilitate the expe-\nrience, but she preferred to keep peo-\nple moving rather than spending class\ntime memorizing anatomy or kinesiol-\nogy. She might lightly brush through\nmuscles and bones as she moved on\nto expressivity, making teaching of\nthe scientific side of the bodywork\nmore like an oriental sumi painting\nthan photo-realism.\nIn addition to her action orientation\nand her uncanny ability to motivate,\nher continual encouragement to view\nthe whole of any phenomenon and\nnot get stuck in the parts was always\ninspiring Marcia B. Siegel said it\nbeautifully in her tribute to Irmgard\nafter her death in 1981, \"Irmgard\nthought in global terms, holistic\nterms. She thought mind, body, and\naction are one, that the individual Is\none with the culture, and function [is\none with expression, space with ener-\ngy, art with work with environment\nwith religion. When you spent a lot\nof time around her you could get\npretty confused and have to go sort\nthings out by yourself, but you could\nnever again see the universe as a\ncollection of isolated particles.\"\nThis capacity to recognize the larg-\ner whole while letting the parts be full\nand interconnected, was evident in\nher ability to let go when she sensed\nthat one of her students needed to\nmove on to another teacher or fulfill\nanother aspect in life. I am thankful\nto Irmgard for her constancy in sup-\nport and for her valuing of change.\nThis has made my own life transitions\neasier. She knew that love and nur-\nturance come from many sources.\nRather than jealously engulf her stu-\ndents, she encouraged all of us to see\nthe larger whole of what we needed\nto do to grow, and to go out and\nengage it. This was, perhaps, her\ngreatest gift\n\n\n\n /// picture ////\n*Effort describes the dynamics of movement\nand inner attitude toward flow (free/bound),\nweight (strong/light), time (sudden/sus-\ntained), space (direct/indirect), fecting tones,\nand texture of movement.\n'Effort-Shape was the name used for Laban\nMovement Analysis until the mid-1970s in\nthe U.S.",

    "Content": "As anyone who has ever tried it can attest, defin-\ning dance or illuminating some aspect of dance can be an\nintricate and oblique task. The philosophical, historical,\ncultural, and aesthetic considerations (to name a few) can\ncombine to form a dense mass of ideas, sometimes comple-\nmentary, sometimes contradictory. Since this multitude of\nconsiderations makes an attempt at a comprehensive view-\npoint unwieldy and equivocal, writers in dance have been\n\nforced to restrict themselves to very specific approaches to\ntheir material. But the search for more effective approaches\nhas had an important by-product. It has become clear that\nsome of the freshest and most exciting insights can be\nachieved when theories and techniques from other fields of\ninquiry are borrowed and applied to the requirements of\ndance.\nExamples of these borrowings can be found throughout\nthe dance literature of the past 25 years; a few would be\nMaxine Sheets-Johnstone's application of the work of Mer-\nleau-Ponty to dance movement in The Phenomenology of Dance\n(1965); the importance of Monroe Beardsley's aesthetics to\nJulie Van Camp's dissertation Philosophical Problems of Dance\nCriticism (1981); the role that feminist criticism plays in Judith\nLynne Hanna's Dance, Sex and Gender (1988); and Mary Alice\nBrennan's application of studies in human cognition to her\ncontinuing research in defining and understanding choreo-\ngraphic creativity. This paper will continue that borrowing\npractice.\nDuring the past thirty years a new area of research, collo-\nquially referred to as \"Chaos,\" has established itself in the\nscientific community. Due to the popularity of a recent book,\nJames Gleick's Chaos: Making a New Science, the study of chaos\nhas begun to influence thought in a wide variety of fields. In\nthe arts, chaos seems to be evolving from a conversational\ntopic to a subject of writing and research. In this paper, by\nrelating some of the basic concepts of chaos to creativity in\nimprovisational dance, I hope to engender further discourse\nbetween these two fields.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThere is a moment that can occur during improvisation\nwhen we achieve a kind of moving \"zen-state\" where our\nconscious mind, that constant editor and critic, shuts down\nmomentarily and allows our body and our subconscious mind\nto take over. While the name may vary, almost every impro-\nviser that I have talked with has experienced this zen-state at\none time or another. Blom and Chaplin, in The Intimate Act of\nChoreograply, describe it as \"a way of tapping the stream of\nthe subconscious without intellectual censorship, allowing\nspontaneous and simultancous exploring, creating, and per-\nforming.\" And although the nature and existence of a conscious\nshutdown could be hotly debated by philosophers, I do not\nIntend here to establish or define it. Since I had already\nexperienced it myself, I prefer to concentrate on the questions\nthat arise once the zen-state has been achieved, and the main\nquestion on my mind is as follows: once we have released\nconscious control, from where does the subconscious mind\ncome up with new movements and coherent images? Or, in\nother words, if we think of the collapse of conscious control\nas creating a kind of void, what do we draw on to fill that\nvoid?\nEvery person, of course, has creative channels unique to\nhis/her own subconscious, thereby bringing individual genet-\nle and environmental determinants to bear on every move-\nment decision. An example of a genetic determinant might\nbe an individual's ration of fast-twitch to slow-twitch muscle\nfibers, dictating a propensity toward certain movement quali-\nties. An example of the influence of personal history (envi-\nronment) might be that the muscle-memory of movements\npreviously experienced in classes and performances could be\nreproduced in new combinations during improvisation.\nWhile this probably does occur at times, it would seem to\nexplain only the most obvious aspects of subconscious mo-\ntion, and would leave no room for the more challenging task\nof creating completely new movement ideas. Another exam-\nple might be the influence that short or long-term emotions\nhave on effort qualities and imagination. A dancer who has\nan argument immediately before improvising could infuse the\nphysicality of his/her anger into the movement.\nWhile these elements of individuality and personal history\ndo partially address the issues we have raised here, they do\nso toward an understanding of what makes us each move\ndifferently. Although this is a very valuable course of inqui-\nry, l am more interested here in searching for subconscious\nmovement sources that are universal. To give some direction\nto this task, I will once again draw on Blom and Chaplin\nwho, in the opening pages of The Moment of Movement, pres-\nent an overview of the elements of improvisational process.\nOne of these elements, \"creating\" influences the present\n\"Creating,\" for Blom and Chaplin, seems to be a flow of\nideas, movements, images, etc., that needs to be channeled,\n\"tamed,\" by the creator. They speak of \"impulses [that] spew\nand spiral at will,\" and that artists \"gain access to broader\nrealms\" of ideas by following their intuition or by \"becoming\na channel through which the vast forces of the universe can\nspeak.\" They do not, however, speculate about the nature of\nthose vast forces. If we wish to attain a deeper understand-\ning of the role of \"creating\" in improvisation, we must at-\ntempt to explore this issue. The remainder of this article will\nbegin that attempt by applying some of the concepts that\nunderlie \"chaos\" to improvisational creativity.\nCHAOS\nPrior to the 1960s, \"chaos\" was just a word that defined a\ntotal lack of order and form, but since that time, \"chaos\" has\nbegun to refer to a field of scientific inquiry into phenomena\nin nature that straddle the boundary between order and dis-\norder, between form and formlessness. Through the process\nof studying these \"dynamical systems\" (Gleick), scientists\nhave discovered that many things previously belleved to be\ntotally random and chaotic actually have very complex, non-\nlinear structures; that, in fact, there seem to be overriding\nprinciples in nature that determine the \"form\" of complexity.\nThe scientists of chaos studied turbulence in liquids, patterns\nin weather, the \"fractal\" structure of snowflakes, yearly fluc-\ntuations of animal populations, and a myriad of other phe-\nnomena, and one after another they proved that chaos could\nbe understood if the observer could only expand his/her\nconcept of that order.\nThere are several concepts within the study of chaos that\ncould have an influence on improvisational creativity. The\nfirst of these is non-linearity. Most systems are linear. They\nare structured so that you can understand or predict the\nwhole by understanding the parts—they \"add up.\" Non-\nlinear systems do not add up. The actions of one part cause\nchanges in the others which cause changes in the one, and so\non to complexity and chaos. Gleick states that \"analyzing the\nbehavior of a non-linear equation-is like walking through a\nmaze whose walls rearrange themselves with each step you\ntake.\"\nSystems of communication are usually linear. If everyone\nunderstands the parts (words, gestures, symbols) and the\nrules by which they combine to form more complex concepts\nthen communicators can be reasonably assured that their\nmessages will be correctly received and interpreted. Dance,\nas a whole, has certain elements in common with the linear\nstructures of language, and much can be learned by applying\nlinguistic analysis to dance. Dance improvisation, though,\nseems by its Immediate and unplanned nature to be less\nlinear than other forms of dance. In fact, Blom and Chaplin\nstate that \"trying to pinpoint in words exactly what dance\nimprov is seems at times to betray the medium itself, for\nlanguage is linear and improv is not.\" The study of chaos,\nbecause it is based on understanding non-linear systems,\nshould be able to shed a new kind of light on understanding\ndance and dance improvisation.\nScientists investigating non-linearity discovered that even a\nsystem with only three determinants could create patterns of\ninfinite complexity. They found that \"the disorderly behavior\nof simple systems acted as a creative process. It generated\ncomplexity….but always with the fascination of living things\"\n(Gleick). They also discovered that minute changes to the\nInput of these systems could create enormous changes in the\noutput. This was the theory of the \"butterfly effect\" in\nweather where the flapping of a butterfly's wings could set\noff a chain of events that would result in a hurricane on\nanother continent. The technical name for this effect is \"sensi-\ntive dependence on initial conditions\" (Gleick).\nEven a cursory look at the factors that influence the cre-\native act of improvisation would show that it is an infinitely\ncomplex phenomenon. Mood, training, past improvisational\nexperiences, sensory input (sound, light, temperature, etc.),\nphysical fitness, and present bodily shape and position in\nspace are just a few of the determinants that could be exam-\nined. The butterfly effect demonstrates that even small varia-\ntions in one of these factors could radically aiter the eventual\nmovement created. Beethoven or silence, angry dancers or\nhappy dancers, the beginning or the end of a performance-if\nany of these conditions changed, completely different move-\nment would be produced. And since the determinants are\nconstantly changing, every time an improviser opens the door\nto the creative forces, the movement that results must be\nunique to the moment.\nFRACTALS\nThe infinite complexity of dance improvisation does not\nonly occur through changes from moment to moment. Com-\nplexity also exists on different levels at the same time. Bun-\ndies of muscle fibers combine to make muscles which fire to\nmove body parts which move and shape to form a body that\nmoves and shapes in both a physically and culturally-deter-\nmined space. In the 1970s, Benoit Mandelbrot and other\nchaos scientists began to investigate this kind of complexity to\nuncover any underlying rules which might govern it. Their\nresulting discoveries about the phenomenon of \"fractals\" is\nnow revolutionizing our understanding of nature and natural\nobjects, particularly the human body.\nThe concept of fractals developed from the recognition that\nour perception of the complexity of natural objects is relative\nto the scale at which we view them. If you were to look at a\nsnowflake with a magnifying glass, you would see that its ice\ncrystals form a geometric pattern. With a microscope you\ncould see that this initial geometic pattern is formed by small-\ner geometric patterns, and so on down to atomic scale. If you\nalso understood the mathematics of fractional dimensions,\nyou could prove that the degree of complexity in the snow-\nflake's structure repeats itself across scales (ie., the geometric\npatterns are equally complex at 10 or 10,000 times normal\nsize). That is a fractal.\nFractals can be found throughout nature. Leaves, bran-\nches, coastlines, and the surfaces of metals and rocks are all\nfractal structures. More importantly, the human body is full\nof fractals: lungs, blood vessels, digestive tissues, liver tissues,\nand aspects of the neural system. Mandelbrot realized that he\nhad discovered one of the organizing principles of nature. I\ncannot help but believe that the prevalence of fractals and\nchaotic systems, both within our bodies and surrounding us\nin the world, must have a profound effect on the nature of\nwhat we create and what we appreciate; and that the very\nconcept of the \"organic\" in movement and form is rooted in\nthese phenomena. I am not alone in this belief. In Gleick's\nbook, Chaos, the German physicist, Gert Ellenberger, said the\nWiry is it that the silhouette of a storm-bent leafless tree\nagainst an evening sky in winter is perceived as beauti-\nful, but the corresponding silhouette of any multi-purpose\nuniversity building is not...? The answer seems to [be\nobjects-in clouds, trees, mountain ranges, or snow crys-\ntals. The shapes of all these are dynamical processes\njelled into pitysical forms...\"\nInstead of the static physical forms of trees, a dancer uses\nthe underlying order and disorder of his/her own natural\nsystem (the body) to create movement that is constantly\nchanging. And yet this movement is still dependent on the\ndetermining factors of genetics and personal history. I can\nthink of no better description for the unique properties of\ndance improvisation than the title of Edward Lorenz's semi-\nnal article on chaotic systems, \"Deterministic Nonperiodic\nFlow.* And Gleick states that flow is \"shape plus change,\nmotion plus form...\" These scientists understood the impor-\ntance of movement and flow to chaos, and that understanding\nis demonstrated by one last concept with an uncanny relation\nto the essence of dance improvisation: a strange attractor in\nphase space.\nSTRANGE ATTRACTORS\nThe investigators of dynamical systems felt that they\nneeded a way to see chaos; that by seeing it they could better\nunderstand it. To accomplish this task, they adopted an idea,\nPhase space is an imaginary multi-dimensional place where\nall the properties of a system at a given moment in time can\nbe condensed and represented by a single point. Any proper-\nty that can be quantified (e.g, velocity) is plotted on a multi-\ndimensional axis. Then, as the properties change over time,\nthe single point that shows them will move to new locations\nin phase space. Eventually these movements will draw a\npicture charting the history of a system. When you plot a\nlinear system in phase space, you wind up with a very orga-\nnized picture. But when these scientists used their computers\nto map out a dynamical, non-linear system, instead of the\nrandom mess of lines you would expect, they were confront-\ned by something astounding-a strange attractor.\nA strange attractor is a phase space diagram that never\nrepeats itself, yet never extends beyond the specific limita-\ntions of a system. It consists of a continuous line that swirls\nand spins in a captive orbit around one or more centers of\nattraction. It is a picture of organized randomness, structured\nchaos, and it is beautiful. The first strange attractor, the\nLorenz Attractor, resembled an intricate owl's mask spiraling\nin on itself. Subsequent attractors were each unique to the\nboundaries and determining factors of the systems they plot-\nted. The mathematical physicist David Ruelle sald: *I have\nnot spoken of the aesthetic appeal of strange attractors. These\nsystems of curves, these clouds of points suggest...a\nrealm...of forms to explore, and harmonies to discover\"\nDANCING CHAOS\nSo how does this relate to dance?\nI would like to propose the rather radical idea that impro-\nvisational dance is a kind of strange attractor. That like its\nscientific counterpart, improvisation offers the viewer a repre-\nsentation of chaos, the structured chaos of human beings in\nthis case, and that through such a representation one can\nperceive and understand much more about the nature of the\nhuman system. My reasoning is as follows:\nWe have already established that improvisational dance is\nnon-linear. The complex and unstable nature of the many\nfactors that determine improvised movement dictate the\nunpredictability of the improvisational product. Although\nthis guarantees that no two movements are exactly the same\nand that the number of possible movements is infinite, it does\nnot mean that any movement is possible. This is because\nimprovisational dance is deterministic as well as non-linear.\nGenetics, personal history, and the physical limitations of the\nhuman body (and the particular bodies of the dancers) are\ndetermining factors that establish a finite boundary for the\ninfinite movement possibilities. There is no possibility of\nmovements beyond this boundary. At no time will the danc-\ner fly, or transform into a fish, or move at the speed of light.\nAn image of such occurrences might be conveyed to a viewer,\nbut only from movements within the range of the human\nIf improvisation is, as 1 am supposing, to represent a com-\nplex creative human being the way that a strange attractor\nrepresents a dynamical system, the characteristics that define\na particular performer's creativity must be trackable through\ndistinct \"channels\" of perceivable information. Some such\nchannels are obvious. A dancer moves through real space in\nthree dimensions at all times. This is easy to track But there\nis so much more that is communicated through movement\nthat can be analyzed through a variety of channels. For\nexample, changes in effort quality or shape can be charted\nusing Laban Movement Analysis. Likewise, the physical\nmanifestations of human non-verbal communication (e.g, eye-\ngaze, gesture, facial expression) constantly provide unique\nand documentable information.\nBut a strange attractor is more than a compilation of chan-\nnels. It is supposed to be a kind of shorthand diagram of a\nsystem that is displayed in such a way as to allow us to focus\nour attention without distractions. Phase space is a conceptu-\nal tool that was created by scientists for this very purpose.\nGleick states that \"motion on (an] attractor is abstract, but it\nconveys the flavor of the real system.\" It could then be\nviewed as simplistic or reductive, and therefore unrealistic,\nbut such an approach may be the only way to allow someone\nto comprehend the inscrutable. History has provided us with\na similar tool for understanding dance.\nIn improvisation, the channels that represent the dance\nsystem are not plotted in phase space (although an attempt to\nquantify and plot a limited cross-section of dance channels in\nphase space might produce fascinating results). Instead,\nimprovisational dance occurs in a similar conceptual tool but\nwith socio-cultural origins: the dance-space. While much\nmore could be said of the dance-space than time here allows,\nsuffice it to say that the dance-space is more than a three-\ndimensional receptacle for movement. It has been historically\ndeveloped as the ideal place to view and perform dances with\nphysical, social, aesthetic, and dramatic implications. Such\nimplications are visible because, by cultural convention, the\nframe of the dance-space allows the viewer to focus attention\nonto only the specific aspects of the performer's humanity\nthat are presented for view (how the performer feels about\n\nhis/her body or what he/she believes about politics is only\nimportant insofar as it is perceivable in the course of the\nperformance). Therefore, the dance-space might be viewed as\nsimplistic or reductive, and again unrealistic, but it is cultural-\nly accepted for its ability to allow us to understand aspects of\nthe complexity that is humanity.\nSO WHAT?\nSo improvisational dance is a kind of strange attractor. It\nis non-linear, deterministic, and it plots the history of specific\naspects of a complex system in a conceptual space designed\nfor that purpose. But how this realization should affect our\nthinking about improvisation is not yet clear. Although this\nquestion can only be answered over time. I think we can\nagain take some direction from the chaos scientists. At a time\nwhen the field of science was stumbling headlong down a\nhundred different paths towards greater and greater detail\nand differentiation, the chaos scientists emerged from many\ndifferent disciplines. They took a step back (or was it up, or\nmaybe out?) so that a meteorologist could excite some mathe-\nmaticians who could talk to some physicists would had some-\nthing to contribute to physiologists. Chaos became more than\njust another tool of a branch of science. It provided the first\nholistic understanding of how all the pieces fit together.\nNot long ago I sat down to dinner with a poet and a pian-\nist and a number of other friends. We talked about chaos.\nFractals in poetry. Musical improvisation as deterministic,\nnon-periodic flow. Eyes were opening, heads were nodding.\nand there were many exclamations of \"Yes...I\" For the first\ntime in a long while I felt like we were all on common\nground. That for just an evening, what was the same about\nour arts and our creativity within them was more important\nthan all of the differences. Our talk simply \nprovided us an opportunity, for an evening, to catch a\nglimpse beyond the veil of creative process and feel a sense of\nwonder.\n\np.s.\n\nThe Lorenz Attractor. This is the very first strango attractor,\ndiscovered by Edward Lorenz. Imagine the foolings Lorenz\nexperienced when this image emerged from a system that was\nthought to ba chaotic. Note how the swirlings never repeat but\nalso never escape the boundaries of the system",

    "Abstract": "This poem reflects on the sudden loss of a dancer named Burt. The author explores the dancer's essence as residing in the realm of artistic inspiration, a space before creation. Through painting, the author reconnects with Burt in a timeless dance, finding solace and shared artistic experience in grief.",
    "Content": "You were dancing in the temple\nwhen you fell\nbetween the money changers and the mills of the gods\ngrinding down the tracks.\nYou had just planted a tree on the altar\nand a line of evergreens down the nave.\nThe knees of your costume were brown and wet\nwith the soil you had been kneeling in.\nOn your knees, on your knees, digging\nthe womb for the new root, the bulb,\ncrazy with deep semen laughter in a continuing\nfertility gavotte.\nI lost you for a moment, you vanished so fast,\nI was dizzy and nauseous in the spinning\nwalkway, the acceleration of time, it was too soon too soon\nfor you to die. Die was not a word that fit you\nin any way.\nNow I know where you are:\nyou are where the colors are\nbefore they come onto my canvas\nyou are where the sounds rise in a realm\nbefore the throat—the words\nbefore we speak them—the lengthening of your arm\nbefore it moves into its new stretch.\nYou are there where we are when we are artists and\nthe Muse has taken us, when we can feel\nthere is something from the other side coming through.\nI found you suddenly, suddenly you and I\nwere in the same timeless spaceless dance. I\nwas painting. I had turned to the colors\nin my grief. I moved the brush.\nYellow, magenta, olive, sienna, gold, rose,\nI felt myself change.\nThe ecstasy spread up my wrists.\nThe edges of my body softened.\nThere you appeared, intent and buoyant.\nWe entered the sanctum together\nand knew where we were, where we are.",

    "Authors": [
      "Burt Supree"

    "Abstract": "This article offers a candid glimpse into the life and perspective of a dance critic. The author reflects on the challenges of constantly evaluating dance performances, the emotional toll of witnessing mediocre work, and the struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Ultimately, the piece explores the critic's evolving relationship with dance and the desire for it to be a source of joy and fulfillment.",
    "Content": "This article is reprinted, with permission,\nfrom Dance Ink, Volume One, Number\nOne, May/lune 1990, 145 Central Park\nWest, NY, NY 10003. It will also be\nincluded in the forthcoming Dance Ink\nAnthology.\nIt's not cricket for dance\ncritics to complain. We don't have a\nharder time than dancers or choreo-\ngraphers, even if the money we gen-\nerally earn is in the same pitiful\nrange. True, we all see much more\nmediocre or incompetent work than\nwe'd like, but then there has to be a\ngreat quantity of such work at all\nlevels if there is also to be choreogra-\nphy worth admiring. Nothing Is\nharder to create than a really good\ndance. Despite our whining and\ngroaning, and in the midst of the put-\ndowns we may trade in the lobby, we\nstill know that.\nDance critics aren't detached ob-\nservers inured to disappointment;\nwe're passionate, prejudiced advo-\ncates with great expectations. When\nyou see too much unrelievedly bad or\ndull work and write too many consis-\ntently unkind but serious reviews, it's\ndifficult not to feel like a bad person.\nOn the other hand, a piece of savage-\nly humorous writing-something\npunishing—lifts the spirits. You feel\nthat you've dispensed justice, that\nrare commodity. And readers love it.\nA critic's strength fluctuates like\nanyone else's. You try to keep up\nwith everything to be fully responsi-\nble, but this is impossible. Years ago,\nI was seeing too many concerts each\nweek, I was frazzled by trying to take\nin too much and having my personal\nlife atrophy, and felt guilty at my\nfailure to meet my obligations to the \nfield. Then Tobi Tobias remarked\nthat, of course, it was impossible to\nkeep up. What a relief! But periodi-\ncally, the pace accelerates and you try\nobsessively to cram everything in.\nOf course, some critics thrive on\ngoing to performances nearly every\nnight; they can see a half-dozen con-\ncerts in one weekend. Not me. Dance\nis not my whole life. Usually, If 1 go\nto more than two or three perfor-\nmances a week, even if I go to some\njust for the pleasure of it, I begin to\nthink I hate dance. Weekends, I get\nout of town unless the weather makes\nit too horrendous to drive, or gloomy\nskies and minus-forty-degree wind-\nchills make being in the country un-\nappealing. This double life keeps me\nrelatively sane, or so I imagine. If I\nstick around I wind up going to a\ncouple of performances. This is work,\nand makes every day of the week\nidentical.\nWhen you're young it's accept-\nable, and hopefully temporary, to\nwork a couple of jobs, rehearse and\nperform, stay up late winding down.\nAt forty-nine, I'm not willing to spend\nall day at the office, spend nights out,\neat dinner at eleven, steal hours here\nand there to write about what I've\nseen. I want to spend some time at\nhome doing nothing playing opera or\nzydeco on the hi-fi, reading a spy\nbook, and keeping an eye on some\ndumb program on the TV with the\nsound off. I want to go out to dinner\nwith pals and not have to jump up\nand run off to a performance just\nwhen we're getting mellow. I want to\nhave a good time, and I expect dance\nto help satisfy that desire. Once I\ndespised the middle-aged people who\ncomplained about sitting on the floor,\neven on cushions. Now I'm one of \nthem. I need a comfortable seat for\nmy tush, decent back support, and a\nreasonably unobstructed view if I'm\ngoing to give a performance the atten-\ntion it may merit. But I want an es-\ncape hatch, too. If I hate a program, 1\nwant to be able to slip out without\nparading in front of the audience and\nthe performers. I'm not willing to be\ntortured, however unintentionally.\nWork that is raw and unfinished\noften appeals to me. But a surprising\nnumber of concerts to which critics\nare invited are far from ready for\nprofessional criticism or review. Cer-\ntainly, choreographers need to show\ntheir work to a public, to people other\nthan their friends and supporters; of-\nten that's the only way to learn what\nworks and what doesn't. But when a\ncritic is seduced by hype to attend a\nperformance of truly naive or inept\nwork, he or she isn't likely to return\nto see another piece by that choreo-\ngrapher for a long time.\nWhile it is essential for a choreo-\ngrapher to have been a dancer, chor-\neographing is a very different kind of\nskill and not every dancer has a feel-\ning for it nor does every person who\nchoreographs a few dances have the\ntalent and Imagination and stamina to\ncontinue. At the same time, there's a\nsense in the modern/postmodern\ndance world that one naturally steps\nup from being a dancer to being a\nchoreographer. And the venture-\nsomeness and confidence of dancers\nwho stretch into composition is one of\nthe elements that makes American\nmodern dance lively and inventive.\nA lack of that strength and mental\nvigor is one of the reasons why ballet\nhas become so nearly moribund.\nBut it is maddening to observe\nchoreographers who don't seem to\nhave any reason to choreograph ex-\ncept that they have acquired a mea-\nsure of the skill in making steps and\nmoving people around. They think\nthey ought to be making dances, so\nthey do despite having nothing to\nsay. Some seem incapable of learning\nfrom their own work For these chor-\neographers, above all, my patience\nhas snapped.\nI wasn't always this intolerant.\nMy inclination is to be supportive.\nBut when my lover became sick with\nAIDS, requiring nearly constant atten-\ntion because of his physical weakness\nand emotional distress, time away\nfrom him became precious. I had to\nsteal time from him to go to the of-\nfice. I went to one performance a\nweek and wrote about it, whatever it\nwas. Those few hours represented\nthe only time I spent absorbed in\nsomething of my own. The private\nactivity kept me sane.\nWorks that seemed pointless or\nwitless or lazy Infuriated me. I didn't\nexpect everything to be good-that\nwould have been idiotic. But l did\nexpect, and demand, that a choreogra-\npher not just be jerking him- or her-\nself off and jerking me around. 1\nexpected that he or she had a specific\nintention and a hard idea of what he\nor she was doing, an idea that was\nreasonably close to reality, and subject\nmatter that was worth the trouble.\nHaving my time wasted was not\nsomething I could shrug off. Every\nperformance was balanced against my\nlover's pain and need. Now, more\nand more this seems to me a legiti-\nmate attitude. Dance Isn't competing\nonly with other leisure time activities;\nIt must stand up to competition with\nthe very best and worst of life.\nDancers and choreographers ex-\npect from us what we expect from\nthem: vision and clarity. Many want\ntheir work discussed in terms of the\nhistory of the art and the output \nthe choreographer as well as in a\ncontemporary cultural context. Few\nwriters have the space to do this in\nmore than a cursory way. Writers\nand editors have to fight for space.\nNewspapers and magazines truthfully\nreflect American culture in their indif-\nference to the arts, except for media\nstars and those arts capable of bring-\ning in commercial revenues.\nPart of the desire of dancers and\nchoreographers, I think, is to elevate\nthe status of dance in artistic dis-\ncourse. This is probably a good idea\nfor lots of reasons-money being only\none. But as it happens, It's a job I'd\nrather leave to others who are better\nat nailing down influences, drawing\nparallels with other fields, and noting\ntrends. I don't believe that abstrac-\ntions and generalities are more mean-\ningful than specific details. I dont \ncare deeply about trends. I don't\nnecessarily care who thought of some-\nthing first and stamped their name on\nit. I'm not very interested in the\nwindbag rhetoric that so brilliantly\njuustifies tedious work by deflecting\nattention from what actually happens\nonstage. You don't have to be anti-\nintellectual to glaze over when you\nhear words like \"semiotics\" and \"de-\nconstruction.\"\nI'm most interested in the imme-\ndiate event of a particular evening:\nwhat I saw, how that struck me, how\nand why it worked or didn't. I don't\nwant to pull away from an event, to\nexperience it remotely. If I can be\ntouched, I want to be. I care about\nthe instance I observe, not about what\nI'm supposed to have seen. I don't\ntry to neutralize the specific baggage\n1, like any audience member, bring to\na performance. Whatever objectivity !\nhave comes from being involved in\ndance since the early sixties, and from\nlooking at a hell of a lot of it.\nUnfortunately, a critic is very\nmuch of his or her time. We usually\nhave the closest affinity for the kinds\nof work we were drawn to early on,\nwork that embodied our own ques-\ntions and that we had to wrestle with\nin forming our own ideas and stan-\ndards. It can be uncomfortable to\nyield to an alien sensibility, particular-\nly the kind that yanks our certainties\nout from under us. It can be hard not\nto automatically subject new work to\nthe strictures of the old; it is some-\ntimes unclear whether familiar stan-\ndards are appropriate. I'm not think-\ning of a set of mental rules. But we\nmay find ourselves unable to experi-\nence a work directly. We hold it at\nbay and it filters into us piecemeal\nthrough our objections. Is that be-\ncause the work is lousy or because it\nis foreign to our taste?\nWhat is taste, anyway? And how\ncan we learn to go beyond our partic-\nular preferences? Is it worthwhile\nstruggling to be more inclusive and\nmore catholic? I think it is essential\nto admit that all is not known, that\ncreation is an ongoing process, and\nthat we can continue to learn. And if\neverything we see is crap? If that's\nso, we can make that judgment but\nwe ought still look in a reasonably\nopenhearted, open-minded way.\nMaybe our opinions aren't always of\nprimary importance. What's crucial is\nto keep our perceptions open and our\nevaluations flexible. The choreo-\ngrapher's task is to give body to an\nidea. And when we pick that matter\napart, however delicate the surgery,\nwe risk denying it its measure of\ntruth.\nWe must believe our eyes. We\nneed to look at dances in the context\nof our whole experience. Yet we\nmust try, too, to see the work as a\nthing in itself, on its own terms as\nsomething possibly new, full of tender\npotential. W e must see it in relation\nto the past, as an expression of the\npresent moment, as a gesture toward\nan unknown future.",

    "Title": "BREITENBUSH CONFERENCE ON CRITICISM",
    "Authors": [
      "Karen Nelson"
    ],
    "Abstract": "This article reflects on a conference focused on dance criticism within a community of Contact Improvisation practitioners. It explores the subjective nature of criticism, highlighting how individual perspectives and biases shape interpretations of performance. The conference utilized exercises like structured writing and focused viewing to expand perceptual awareness and foster more dynamic dialogue among participants.",
    "Content": "It seemed like such a huge\ntask to speak about a subject so per-\nsonal: how we feel about each other's\nwork. We come together to dance for\none week a year, many of us repeated-\nly for the last ten years and some for\nthe first time. There is a sense of\nongoing community with transmissions\nfrom years past coming into the pres-\nent. Yet in many ways we hardly\nknow each other. We don't know\nmuch about the performance work\neach other makes and the process\ninvolved. To speak about that work\nscemed like a big risk. I felt anxiety\nat the thought of the goal we had set\nbefore ourselves: to agree by consen-\nsus on two programs of performance,\ndrawing from the work of about twen-\nty-five artists.\nMy overall and underall impression\nor realization during the conference\nwas that criticism is a perceptual\npractice. Really, that's all it is. Each\nperson has ways of seeing-habitual,\nIcarned, experimental. This bias is the\nbasis of criticism.\nRachel Kaplan writes dance criti-\ncism. Her concerns are largely about\nthe politics of that action.\nquestions about power, intention, histo-\nry, education. She talks about it in her\nperformance piece about her teachers,\n\"Going Far Is Returning.\" She refers\nto the importance of writing about\neach other and the net it casts out into\nSo we wrote about each other. We\ntook Christina Svane's \"Fountain\"\nscore as a method to reflect on each\nperformance we saw. We would write\nfor 3 minutes following each work,\nthen meet after the performances and\nhave a reading of the writings. I\nlearned a lot in these sessions, hearing\nfrom all the different eyes, hearts and\nsouls who had been exposed to the \nsame event as I had been. Everyone\nhad their unique experience, yet simi-\nlarities were telling. On the other side\nof the coin, after I performed, I experi-\nenced the period of time when the\naudience was writing as a sensation of\nenergy continuing to move. Creativity\nwas breeding more creativity and it\ndidn't get stuck on a particular person\nIn our discussions about criticism,\nthe issue of \"criteria\" came up. We\nwanted to identify the different lenses\nwe watch a work through. So we\nspent time trying to notice our natural\nor habitual choices of viewing and also\ntried on some less natural ways in\norder to stretch our tendencies. We\nwatched improvised \"pick-up\" pieces\nwith a time-and-personnel structure\nsolo for one minute, duet for 2 min-\nutes, etc. Then we'd go around the\ncircle listing one \"criterium\" of what\nwe were looking at or for. Here is a\nvery small portion of that list (from\nnotes by Rachel Kaplan): Interest,\nsound, senses, circles, heaven, brave,\nstimulation, outrage, gender, bones,\nattitude, rhythm, narrative, perspective,\nbody parts, character, seeing, inten-\ntion, balance, connection, distance,\ndrama, transitions, readiness, subtext,\nbody tone, focus, response, gaze, ar-\nchitecture, time, space, image, scale,\ncontinuum, dynamics, energy, move-\nment states, emotion, relation, history,\npolitics, presencelattention, perform-\nerlaudience relationship. I think we\nwere all surprised at the infinite num-\nber of ways to see and experience.\nAt a later session we viewed for-\nmal performances with specific criteria\nto inform our writing.\nOne group would watch for narrative in the work,\nanother for composition/craft and\nanother for their subjective person\nresponses. We also included a wild-\ncard group in which people could\nmake up their own criteria on the spot.\nIt was a good stretch of perceptual\nmuscles to view work in ways I don't\nnaturally want to. It showed me how\nI choose to see the way I do and why\nI like to see that way. In recognizing\nmy own preferences, I give room to\nothers for their's. This creates the\nconditions for dynamic dialogue.\nFor a visually impaired person,\ndance criticism is frankly a drag.\nMegan Hughes, who is visually im-\npaired and drawn to the dance form of\ncontact improvisation because of its\naccessibility, felt \"disabled\" by the\ntopic of dance criticism, which at that\npoint seemed to be based on visual\nperception. Another disabling aspect of the\nconference, for Emery Blackwell, a\nman with cerebral palsy, was its de-\npendence on verbal or written commu-\nnication. Because he doesn't write\nwith a pen, Emery couldn't participate\nin the three-minute writings, and be-\ncause his speech takes some time to\nutter and to understand, in big group\ndiscussions he'd often choose to not\nspeak especially where the time was\npreciously short.\nThe next day, in an attempt to\nunderstand these issucs, a small group\nof us got together. We practiced\n\"viewing\" work with our eyes closed,\nwhile others, with cycs open, verbally\ninterpreted what they saw while speak-\ning with rocks in their mouths. And\nstill others, blindfolded, verbally trans-\nlated the rock-mouthed speaking.\nAfterwards, the blindfolded \"viewers\"\nmoved as a means of feeding back to\nthe performers and translators what we\n\"felt\" had happened. Our small\ngroup's performance report was a\nmixture of re-oriented communication,\nchaotic charm and art.\nLater in the conference during a\nround robin, we had agreed to speak\nabout what we were perceiving/seeingas \nwe danced and as we watched.\nPartnerships changed frequently as\nwell as the configurations-solos,\nduets, trios, quartets-according to the\ndesires of the individuals involved. At\nfirst the \"criteria\" was open to any-\nthing but after awhile it was agreed we\nwould hone in on one subject. In the\ncourse of improvising, perceiving, and\nspeaking, the group landed on the\ncriteria of \"satisfaction or not.\" The\nfollowing was noted by K.J. Holmes:\nSATISFYING-endings,\nspace, delicacy of fingers, focus, past\nimage, obstructed view, group unified,\ndifferent levels, synchronistic, the light,\nstaying with\nrhythm, acceptance of support, stimu-\nlation in non-sarisfaction.\nNOT SATISFYING-space gets\ntoo busy too fast, confusion and wait.\ning, not finishing an image, predici-\nability of change, bumpy weight ex-\nchange, more satisfying to do than to\nwatch, not being able to see what was\ngoing on, holding on to an image after\nit is not working.\nAgain the variety of perceptions\nand opinions brings home the ques-\ntion— since we all make up our own\nmovie, why worry if you like some-\nthing (or make something) someone\nelse hates? It's our diversity of expe-\nrience that we have to compare and\ncontrast. We are different and that\ngives us a need and a possibility to\nlearn.\nWell, the organization of the per-\nformances came off without one hitch.\nIn past years a few of us would make\na ton of decisions regarding other\npeople's work, like how to fit it into\nthe program, etc. The concerts were\nalways too long. This year the group\nmade the decisions. We agreed to\nmake shorter programs and we had\nunanimous agreement in the ordering.\nPlaces where we needed to tweak\nsome work, for example, by cutting\ntime or overlapping with another piece,\netc., were all worked out by the artists\nthemselves. People in general seemed\nquite willing to speak about their im-\npressions of the pieces and how they\nfit or didn't fit together. I think we\ndiscovered that our practice of criti-\ncism enabled efficient and satisfying\norganization of a public performance.\nThe dialogue of perceptions had a\nformal container at the Conference on\nCriticism. Thanks, everyone, for the\nart. Some subjects tossed around for\nnext year's conference include: pres-\nence, inspiration, composition, and\nteaching.\n\nTHESE PAINTINGS are by Megan Hughes, a British\nartist, who is visually impaired and a newcomer to\nShe was invited to the Breiten-\nbush Jam and Conference by Britain's Touchdown\nDanco. Theso paintings were a kind of premonition of\nwhat I would bo doing many yoars later in Contact,\"\nMegan says, 'My work in Contact danco now influences\nmy paintings even more...\"",

    "Abstract": "This article explores the elusive nature of 'quality' in dance and performance, particularly within improvisation. The author questions whether quality is subjective, relative to experience, or a transient, moment-to-moment process. They emphasize the importance of connecting with audiences beyond the dance community and express frustration with critics who dismiss improvisation due to perceived inconsistencies in quality.",
    "Content": "that word keeps\npercolating through my conscious-\nness since last year's Breitenbush\nJam/ Conference. How do we define\nwork that is of qualiry? Presence,\nfocus, honesty, facility, radiance,\nclarity of intention, organic, being in\nthe thing and not thinking too much\n...the ability to move people??? Is\nqualiry only in the eye of the behold-\ner? Or is it something which is\nourside of us and that we simply\nacknowledge when we experience it.\nI find it curious how my tastes\nchange as / grow older.\nI thought were of incredibly high\nquality five or ten years ago, might\nnot interest me now. Does it still\nhave qualiry? Well sure. This goes\nfor my own work as well as that of\nothers. Five years ago i might have\ndone something and thought, wow.\nthat was really great! And now, 1\nmight look at the limitations or the\nthings that didn't work.\nIs quality something that is rela-\ntive-to the artist's level of experi-\nence, the audience, the environment?\nI think the quality of a beginner's\nwork is different than the qualiry of\nsomeone who is more experienced\nyet quality can exist in both cases.\nThis makes me wonder if this thing\nwe call quality, particularly in re-\nspect to performance, is a moment-\nto-moment experience, involving tran-\nsient elements. From this perspec-\ntive, qualiry is no longer a thing or a\nstandard, but a process. Hmmm...\nI'm curious how it is that I can\nhear a singer singing in a language\nthat I don't understand and know\nthat the person is singing from their\nheart; that they have \"soul.\" It is\nnot simply a matter of technique,\nbecause I've heard many accom-\nplished musicians who fail to inspire\nthis kind of experience in me. I\nsometimes wonder how my skill as a\nlistener or audience member comes\ninto play. I often have a tendency to\nlook at dance primarily from the\nperspective of movement-does it\nmake sense, is it real or affected,\nwhere's the movement coming from?\netc. There are other ways to view\ndance, surely, that are just as valid.\nFrom my point of view, the most\ninspiring art, the kind of art I want\nto create, is art that can be appreci-\nated by people who know little or\nnothing about the discipline involved\nin my particular medium. It means a\nlot to me when one of my peers\nspeaks to me after a performance.\nappreciating the work that I've put in\nand my success or lack of success in\nexpressing what I'm trying to say—\nneed that. But when someone who\nknows linle about dance andior im-\nprovisation comes up after a perfor-\nmance and expresses how they con-\nnected to what I was doing. feeling,\nor sensing-that's great! When I am\nable to engage their interest, particu-\nlarly their heart, it is very satisfying.\nIt makes me feel that I'm not just\npreaching to the converted. Is it\npossible to be committed to one's\nwork, to be engaged fully on a heart\nlevel and not make work of quality?\nI doubt it.\nWhat I find difficult to deal with\nis that critics often write off improvi-\nsation as a performance form prob-\nably because they've seen bad impro-\nvisation. I will be the first to admit\nthat bad improv can be pretty awful.\nBut so can bad choreography. What\nare the odds that when you go to see\na performance of set work that it will\nbe good? Are these any better than\nthe odds of seeing a good improvised\nperformance? I seriously doubt it.\nFact is I think a lot of the dance /\nsee is not that interesting and not of\nhigh quality.\nSo wity do critics feel the need to\nput down improv? I often wonder if\nit has to do with their inability to\nshowcase their analytical skills when\nthey are writing about improvisation.\nImprovisation makes the critics' job\nmore difficult because it requires that\nthey open themselves up to a lot of\npossibilities rather than put things\ninto identifiable boxes.",

The author explores the relationship between the performer's private and public selves, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to performance practice. The piece further contemplates the role of criticism in illuminating the \"rupture\" or gap between things, viewing it as a space for improvisation and change.",
    "Content": "New Ways to Will Change \n\n\n\nThe conference following the\n1992 Contact Jam at Breitenbush Hot\nSprings focused on the issue of criti-\ncism and its relationship to perfor-\nmance. In October, 1991, I received\na letter from Karen Nelson from\nsomewhere in Europe inviting me to\nBreitenbush to participate in the jam\nand the conference. She had read an\narticle published in CQ about my\nexperience as a performer and critic\n[\"Wky / Write Criticism,\" 16:1,\nWinter 91/ and was interested in\nwhat it was I actually thought I was\ndoing. Somewhat outside the contact\ncommunity for the last few years, I\naccepted her invitation, not knowing\nwhat to expect except (at the very\nleast) hot tubs and tall trees. I was\nmore than willing.\nDuring the jam, in an effort to\nengage everyone in the process of\nconsidering criticism, after people\nperformed, the witnesses would\nspend three minutes writing their\nthoughts, reflections, and ideas about\nthe work. This structure came to us\nfrom something Christina Svane calls\nThe Fountain and is practicing in\nAmsterdam [see \"The Fountain,\" CQ\n17:2, SummeriFall 92]. Our version\nof The Fountain was ostensibly more\n\"critical\" and less \"poetic\" than\nSvane's version, although everyone\nwas given the opportunity to play as\nthey wished. After the jam ended,\nwe had two days to focus more in-\ntensively on the issue of criticism\nand how it interfaces with the act of\nperformance. The conference was\nrather haphazard and spontancous.\nbut what was generated that was of\nsome importance was the beginnings\nof a new language with which to\nspeak to one another about what it\nwas we were secing.\nWhat follows are some thoughts\non criticism and performance that\ncame to me after my time in Oregon.\nWhat I'm most interested in\nabout performance and criticism right\nnow has to do with bridging and\nultimately closing the gap between\nthe public and the private world,\nbetween who I am when I am alone\nand who I am when 1 am in public.\nIt is for me an ideal that the perform-\ner represent on stage, in public, her\nprivate self, and that the act of per-\nforming is the practice of traversing\nthe realm between the personal and\nthe public. The most luminescent\nmoments in performing come when\nthey are one and I am interested in\nhow elusive this moment actually is,\nand how profound.\nI was thinking something about\nnarrowing this gap between myself\non stage and myself in the world as\nbeing central to my performance\npractice, and then I tore the ligaments\nin my knee, and the riots exploded in\nL.A., and so I was thrown into think-\ning of ruptures, and of gaps, and\nabout jumping into them, right into\nthe gap, as a way to close it.\nWe are living in a time of frag-\nmentation, disintegration, reforma-\ntion. From the riots in L.A., to the\nmedia hallucinations we call George\nBush and Bill Clinton, to our con-\nstantly shifting relationships, and\netcetera, we are in a time of rupture.\nThe invitable gap between things\ncreates a place for improvisation, a\nplace of not knowing. The leaps the\nimprovisor takes towards the rupture\nare important because this space\nholds the material we need to get\nI am thinking about jumping\ninto these gaps, instead of denying or\navoiding them, as a way to change\nthe status quo. I am also trying to\nunderstand how, or if, the act of\ncriticism-seeing, perceiving, feeding\nback-serves this jump into the void.\nIf the critic can perceive the artist\njumping into this gap and elucidate\nnot only the jump but the landing—\nwhat the artist finds when she gets\nthere, then perhaps the acts of perfor-\nmance and criticism will bring a light\ninto the dark places of the rupture.\nI base all of my remarks on an\nassumption of the innately political\nnature of art. An interpretive strate-\ngy for all of this is a metaphoric one.\nArtist-critic-audience, family systems,\nhuman-natural world relationships,\nlove relationships-are all metaphors\nexisting in the field of the rupture.\nAs usual, I circle around the\nimage of the circle and wonder how\nwe can come to one another with the\nkind of attention we need to fuel our\nwork. I think it matters fundamental-\nly that we pay as much attention as\nwe can to these ruptures-between\nthe body and the mind, life and art,\nthe artist and the audience, the critic\nand the artist, the work and the larger\nworld—and jump into the gaps be-\ntween them.\nIt may be that the gap between\nperforming artists and critics can\nonly be bridged when the artist and\nthe critic come to better perceive the\nnature of each other's work. I think\nit is important for an artist to become\nher own critic as an exercise in learn-\ning to see and in developing self-\nacceptance. If, as performers, we\ncannot acknowledge our own inner\njudges and instead project them onto\nthe eyes of our watchers, our audi-\nences, we will never fully give the\ngift of our attention in performance\nbecause our fear of judgement will\noverwhelm the truth of the work. I\nbelieve our re-evaluation of these\nroles of performer, critic, audience/\nwitness holds within it the possibility\nof relationships of more depth within\nthe dance community.\nIf the act of performance is the\npractice of being myself in public,\nthen the act of criticism acknowledg-\nes and elucidates this gesture, and\nconsolidates it in the world through\nwords.\nUsing my words, as a critic, I\ncan serve the function of making\ntangible and finite the dance which is\ntransitory and atemporal. Using my\nsenses, as a witness, I can serve the\nfunction of grounding the fluid ges-\ntures of the dancer in my visceral\nand kinesthetic responses. The crit-\nic—an articulate observer of the in-\nchoate experience that is dance—has\nthe job of helping the artist draw\ncloser to the self by tracking her own\ninternal experience and making it\nclear to a viewer. This articulation\ncan connect and interpose the percep-\ntions of both the critic and the artist.\nThese are acts of illumination, inti-\nmacy, identification, communion.\nThe critic can substantiate per-\nformance by elucidating its formal,\nemotional, and physical qualities and\ntransmitting them in words. But to\nbe this kind of critic, I must be will-\ning to suspend my disbelief, play\nalong with the rules of the performer,\nand be ready at all times to see and\nfeel the connection, luminosity, and\nreality that exists between me and the\nartist.\nWhat is useful in the critics art?\nCriticism can consolidate community\nartist initiates. In the act of clarify-\ning what is seen-verbally, emotion-\nally, intuitively, kinesthetically-the\ncritic has the responsibility of receiv-\ning a communication from the artist\nand transmitting it intelligently across\nthe rupture to the witnesses of the\nwork.\nI want to facilitate the creation\nof these relationships between us as\nthe essential underpinnings of our\nlives—what makes it possible for us\nto continue and to flourish. I believe\nthat through the act of conscious see-\ning, conscious feedback, and con-\nscious acknowledgement of the work\nI see, I become more connected to\nwhat surrounds me.\nAm I saying anything that hasn'!\nbeen said before? I'm not sure. All\nI know is, it's about relationship.\nIt's about care. And we still haven't\ngot it yet. It's too simple",

    "Abstract": "This interview with Pauline de Groot explores her philosophy on dance technique, emphasizing personal investigation and sensing the body's \"here and now.\" She contrasts this approach with what she perceives as a militaristic shaping of the body in some traditional techniques. De Groot highlights the importance of tuning into gravity, levity, emotion, and sensation to unlock free and diverse movement qualities, drawing from influences like T'ai Chi and yoga.",
    "Content": "Amsterdam 17 April 1992\n\nEchos resounding throughou\nthe modern dance world a t the begin-\nning of this century: Dance that is\nexperimentation. Trial and error.\nAn unfolding of possibility. Today,\nthe once revolutionary forms of Dun-\ncan, St. Denis, Shawn, and Martha\nGraham have become \"classics'\nwithin the spectrum of modern dance.\nas the form and pressure of contem-\nporary times have given birth to\nanother equally exciting generation\nof pioneers; one of whom is Pauline\nde Groot, who has set the tone for\nmost of the creative new dance work\nthat has emerged in the Netherlands\nin the past twenty-five years.\nAfter study in the U.S.A. (1957-\n1965) with Martha Graham, Merce\nCunningham, and Erick Hawkins,\nand performing with the companies\nof José Limon and Erick Hawkins,\nPauline returned to the Netherlands\nand introduced new ideas about\ndance, the body, and aesthetics. It\nwas her studio that formed the basis\nof the School for New Dance Devel-\nopment at the Theaterschool, Amster-\ndam.\nExploring the resources and di-\nmensions of energy in movement, she\nintegrated into her work principles of\nmovement disciplines such as T'ai\nChi, Release Technique, Todd Align-\nment, and Contact Improvisation.\nHer nonconformity and her work\nwith unusual dance skills has over\nthe years led to various approaches\nto performance, from open improvi-\nsation to set choreography and theat-\nrical events, from using speech and\nlive music to silence.\nPauline de Groot performs and\nchoreographs in an international\ncircuit of new dance and is a guest-\nartist at academies and dance institu-\ntions around the world. [R.B.]\n\nPauline de Groot: What is tech-\nnique? I ask myself. I consider\ntechnique to be an investigation into\nthe possibilities of movement within\none's body. Research on a deeply\npersonal, physical, practical level.\nRonnle Britton: How would you go\nabout this research?\nPauline: Practically, it's very sim-\nple. I usually start lying on the floor.\nSensing, breathing, until I can sense\nmy \"here and now\" as I let go of al\nthat is superimposed. Often some-\nthing as simple as lying on the floor\nis difficult. I see technique as build-\ning-blocks, the basis out of which\ndance can grow. It is also the neces-\nsary strengthening of a dancer's alert\nbody. It is investigation and practice,\nhand in hand. Directly. Physically.\nThe tuning of the mind with the body\nas opposed to a mindless, militaristic\nshaping of the body.\nRonnie: What kind of mindless.\nmilitaristic shaping?\nPauline: It depends on the teacher.\nBut some teachers approach the body\nposition. It doesn't have to be any\none specific technique, but if you ask\nme about Graham, I think that within\nthe Graham technique there is the\ndanger of handling the body in a\nmilitaristic way, although not all the\nGraham instructors would do this.\nStill, it happens. Technique for me\nis a tuning to gravity and levity from\noutside, emotion and sensation inside.\nRonnie: One of the things you\ntalked about before was weight and\nrhythm in the body making form. I\nwould be very interested to know\nhow that concept developed and how\nyou have worked with it in order to\ndevelop your particular movement\nlanguage.\nPauline: Because I believe that\nwhen you initiate movement in one\npart of the body it will create a chain\nreaction of movement in another. I\ncould start with an experiment-say\nin the joints-which will lead to\nmovement in other parts of the body.\nWhen the body is tuned and open to\ndifferent reactions, it's not in a ma-\nnipulated state, and these impulses\ncan free many other different quali-\nties of movement.\nRonnie: You once spoke about your\nexercises with Tai Chi, breathing,\nyoga, and the Open Theatre. You\nalso spoke about freeing the mind\nand working with unknown verbal\nandior physical expression-dis-\ncovering other forms. Is this all\nsomething which helped you to come\nto this idea of weight and rhythm?\nPauline: You know, the ideas are\nformulations of something which is\nalready happening. The idea may\nsound very intricate and thought out\nbut really it's merely an attempt to\nput into words what we are actually\ndoing at any moment. Yoga was\nvery good, as was the work with the\nOpen Theatre. From the Open Thea-\ntre, for example, we used exercises\ninvolving lying on the floor but in no\nparticular shape and not even trying\nto sense the structure of the body, but\nimagining you are an animal waking\nup in the woods. So your movement\nis guided by another idea, another\nenvironment. Changing your imag-\nined environment will quite naturally\nchange the movement and can lead to\nvery interesting impulses.\nThe importance of sensation.\nSensing the forces that are present,\nthe flow and breathing. Imagery to\nmake one aware of the anatomy, to\nsee the structure of the body from the\ninside...initiating movement from\ndifferent parts of the body. Imnges\nof opening and closing in the joints,\nlengthening, widening. Letting go of\ntrying to hold the body, which is\noften our defense against pain, in\norder to allow for efficient alignment\nand use of energy. Letting scientific\nknowledge of the anatomy inform the\nmechanics of movement through the\ncreative process. Technique is a kind\nof training of the mind and body\ntogether; a correction of bad habits.\nRonnie: What bad habits?\nPauline: Holding. Tightening up.\nBad habits that can lead to injury.\nHaving too much tension in a partic-\nular part of the body or not aligning\noneself properly. Alignment can be\nquite a job because we all have accu-\nmulated so many bad habits. Tech-\nnique for me is also the discipline of\npractice. A daily listening and doing.\nUnderstanding the basis of practice.\nListening to the body's inner flow.\nYou can say it's very physical but\nonce you begin to listen to the physi-\ncal flow, you also begin to hear.\nYou're talking to yourself and every-\nthing begins to mesh. The sensation\nof correct alignment and an opening\nup to the sensation of \"now', which\nis not only what is happening at that\nmoment within the body, but also\nwithin the whole being and environ-\nment-the immediate experience.\nWith technique as such, in which the\ndropping of old habits is possible, it\nis equally possible to leam phrases of\ndifferent styles.\nRonnie: With that last statement, it\nsounds as if technique for you is\nalmost a generic term.\nPauline: That's the way I sce it\nalthough it can never be taught in a\ngeneric way because even if it's\nbased on the most generic principles,\neveryone gives it their own form. I\nwouldn't find anything wrong with\nthe forms, so long as the generic\nqualities are present.\nRonnie: After ballet, Graham,\nHawkins, and Cunningham, you\ncontinued your search for something\nthat was more your own. You've\nspoken to me abour Martha's \"psy-\nchological dramas,\" Erick's orna-\nmental technique. Cunningham's very\nquick, rapid technique. Erick sent\nyou to Andre Bernard. Let's talk\nabout letting go of unnecessary ten-\nsions and feeling one's own possibili-\nties and your specific work with that\nafter these four very different periods\nin your life.\n\nPauline: The work with Bernard\nwas at the basis of my own experi-\nmentation. It helped me to discover\nwhat it is to listen to the body, to do\nnothing. He teaches kinesiology.\nYou'd lie on a table and he would\ntouch parts of the head or the neck,\nwherever he happened to be standing\nover you. He only touched you. He\nwould then suggest imagining that\nthe touch could travel from one side\nof the body all the way through to\nthe other. From there something\nwould happen because you imagine\nthat it is happening. And all because\nyou are doing nothing. As soon as\nyou started to do something he would\nsay \"No, no, don't do anything, just\nimagine.\" Soon it becomes clear that\nthese images are constantly changing\nthe whole feeling in your body, so\nthat you can allow yourself to let go,\nor just experience the body in a way\nthat it is there instead of as a shape\nor form.\nRonnie: You've also said that you\ncan actively allow movement to occur\ninstead of trying to force the move-\nment. Was there something else you\nwere doing during the time you\nworked with Bernard that was a way\nof experimenting with what you had\nlearned or did that not start until you\ncame back to Holland?\nPauline: As you are asking me this\nquestion, I'm trying to remember \nwhat first gave me such a clear sen-\nsation of gravity and i realize that\nthis feeling was probably always\nthere, and that I could guide gravity\nthrough my spine into the ground. I\nalso felt as if I could get energy up\nfrom the ground. There were thus\nalways two directions this energy\nwas moving in, upwards and down-\nwards. I think the work with Andy\nmade all this very clear.\nRonnie: After you returned to Hol-\nland, what had your own work be.\ncome? With which forms were you\nexperimenting? I made a note about\nsomething you said about using one's\nown energy in order to shape it into\nform.\nPauline: That really has to do with\nimprovising as we always do when\nwe are trying to make something—\ndancing to anything, salsa for exam-\nple, just to generate some kind of\nmovement. I knew that I wanted to\ncreate my own work and so I had to\nfind a way of doing this. I didn't\nknow my way around and so I decid-\ned that teaching would be a very\ngood way of beginning.\nRonnle: What were you doing in\nyour teaching in order to further\nyour experiments?\nPauline: When I started teaching\nhere in Holland, I leaned a lot on\nexercises I had done with Erick in\nthe States. I had also been able to\ncreate short pieces of my own while\nI was with him, and teach a little, so\nI had been able to figure out what I\nwanted to teach at my own pace:\nsimple rhythmical patterns, brushes,\nmovement on the floor. Pushing into\nthe floor and coming out of the floor\nwere both very strong movements for\nme. This was mostly what I was do-\ning because I had cut out the arms\nfor a while. I couldn't deal with them\nand decided I just wanted to have the\narms hanging instead of shaped in a\nway that had not been to my liking.\nRonnie: When did the arms come\nback in?\nPauline: Well of course the arms\nwere always there. But I wanted the\narms to be energized because of what\nthe body was doing and not posi-\ntioned. I felt they could serve to\n\"balance\" the action of the body.\nRonnie: How have your experiments\nfurthered since that time?\nPauline: In 1974, I met Mary Ful-\nkerson who had been working in\nEngland for a while. I had read her\nwritings on the axis of the body,\npractical knowledge of the anatomy,\nand \"letting go.\" I thought that here\nin Europe no one besides me had\never spoken about that before, in\nspite of the fact that I had been look-\ning for it. So I thought I had to meet\nher, which took quite a while. It\nstarted a whole new exchange. I had\nalready been teaching in England\nevery year at the Dartington Dance\nFestival. When Mary became lead\nof the Dance Department there,\nthings took on a different shape. She\norganized a yearly festival of 'new\ndance' and invited people from Eu-\nrope and the U.S. who were in the\nprocess of creating new dance work.\nI hadn't studied with her of course,\nwhich at the time I would have liked\nto do, but there I had the chance to\nsee what she was doing. She also\nhad Steve Paxton over to teach, an\nold friend from our dancing times\ntogether in the '60s in NY whose\nwork since then I didn't know. I\nrealized that I'd missed what they\nhad been doing through the years I'd\nbeen back in Holland setting up shop.\nFor the next couple of years I\nwent into studying Contact Improvi-\nsation and Release Technique when I\ncould, and reconnected with the\npractitioners of it, my own genera-\ntion, who became my friends and\ninformed my work. I began to bring\nthis work over to the Theaterschool,\nModern Dans, which took an im-\nmense effort to accomplish. It was\nan intense period. And it has contin-\nued since then.\nI'm working with Flamenco now,\nan old love, in my odd hours. I love\nthe rhythms. I don't know if it's\ngoing to influence my work, any\nmore than it already has. I'm also\nstill working with Tai Chi. This\nhelped me to find a lot of my basics\nwith respect to weight and using the\nminimal amount of energy-the most\nefficient way. This was exactly what\nI needed to find in order to develop\nmy dance technique. Now people are\ninto Aikido, another wonderful form,\nvery disciplined and energized.\nAt the moment I am what I might\ncall \"taking advantage\" of the late\ntwentieth century's developments in\nthe arts and sciences, on a dance\nlevel, using the body's individual\nprocessing (of ideas and images) to\nallow its current language to emerge.\nThis is leading me into increasing\ncomplexity in movement and in the\nchoreography-much more set and\nless improvised. This creates a very\ninteresting dialogue with the dancers.\nThe present piece, Edge of Light is\nthe outcome of that process. It is a\nlight piece with the special idiosyn-\ncrasies of the dancer",

    "Abstract": "Deborah Hay explores the concept of \"dying\" as a somatic practice, using it as a metaphor to heighten awareness of impermanence and expand movement capabilities. She investigates the cellular body's understanding of dying, not as a physical sensation but as a state of being in communion with all things. This exploration aims to liberate the dancer from societal fears surrounding death and invigorate their experience of living in each moment.",
    "Content": "\"What a relief,\"\nthe body speaks.\n\"No need ignore\ndying anymore,\nor dance\npermanence.\"\n\nIn the Austin-based movement/performance workshop Playing Awake 1991,\ndying was the metaphor for playing awake. This came about because I could not\nhelp but notice how much I enjoyed playing dying in the concluding few minutes\nof my evening-length solo The Man Who Grew Common In Wisdom. For the\nnext three years, investing solely in the intelligence of my cellular body as guide. I\nexplored the perception of the movement of dying. My book, Lamb at the Altar\ndescribes this journey and how the large group workshop functions as a\nlaboratory for this and other such explorations. The following are excerpts from\nLamb at the Altar.\n\nLamb a t the Altaris about the whole body of a dancer exploring dying. She\nunderstands dance to include the action of dying, whether or not she chooses to\nrealize it. She is making an effort to come to terms with dying as an experiential\nprocess of which she possesses negotiable comprehension. She wants to include\nthe perception of dying in her performance practice because it invigorates her living\neach moment. She is not talking about the emotional, psychological, clinical, or\ncultural attitudes about dying although she uses the energy surrounding these\nbellefs to fire her attention.\n\nI explore the action of dying as a means to expand my capabilities as a movement\nartist. My brother plays a pivotal role in this dance. His poetry preys on death.\nOnly recently does my resistance to his fascination abate. I place his new\nmanuscript on the dining-room table and walk back to my studio. *Okay, Deborah,\nadmit your cellular body knows dying.\" No sooner do 1 have the thought than I am\nwashed with a force like a deep, dark rushing river. I am pulled along by its\nconstancy. I stay and stay in the dance, alarmed, awed, humbled, breathless. I\nquestion whether I have ever experienced living, without the yardstick dying now\nrepresents.\n⼜\nDying is movement in communion with all there is.\n\nFor years changing was the metaphor for my attention to movement. Now I use\ndying, taking advantage of the tremendous power, both mine and society's, of\nfeelings associated with AIDS, war, famine, ecological catastrophe. I seize the\nImpact of fear and concern, temporarily lifting it from my head and heart. Activated\npressure, into a bittersweet recognition of dying as perceived by every cell in my\nbody. The effort to maintain this alternative awareness of dying is equal in intensity\nto the consuming negative energy from fearing death.\n\nI cannot identify the feeling of dying as a body process. The action of dying is\nwithout direction, momentum, gravity or shape. I feel running or yearning but\ncannot identify a kinesthetle experience with dying. Dying is like seeing. I look at\na diagram of how the eyeball works yet what does it really tell me about seeing?\n\nDying is our common denominator. Dying is always affecting our being yet few can\ndescribe the feeling Its activity generates. Free from the seduction of a physical\nfeeling of dying we are thus liberated from doing or not doing it. I am not talking\nabout death or decay. As a movement arlist I am examining dying, realtzing !\ncannot associate a physical feeling with its uninterrupted action on my being.\nDying just 'Is.\n\nI look at the celling and see a dusty black, cotton candy looking surface, trusses,\nlight fixtures and a skylight. I see a host of unpleasant concrete matter. I know the\ncelling will not be around forever but I forget to remember this. My culture\nsupports fixity. I forget to remember impermanence.\n\nI change 'celling into 'Ifetime of celling. I practice remembering to see the\nimpermanence. Separate parts start to disappear. Names vanish. Content goes.\nFrom here it is an easy jump to commune with the passing of all things. I am\nexperiencing the death of separateness.\nEarlier in my life and career 1 considered being just so as less than admirable. One\nof the more remarkable consequences in the practice of dying is the crucial\nrealtzation that each moment is just so. There is no time to describe how beautiful\nor great something is if my attention is cast on this passing present—no time to\ndwell on feelings and thoughts. Everything I see becomes just so crucial to realtze\nnow.\n\nDying, as a movement practice, is a step toward a non-thinking process. I bypass\nthe desire to know by acknowledging wherever I am. dying ts. If the reflex to want\nto feel or understand dying kicks in, and it often does. I make a deliberate effort to\nspeed up my movement, not think, toss my witness out in front of me, have her\nturn back around to include dying in whatever she see.\n\nThe desire to become unconscious is another kind of dying. The seduction to drift\nis so powerful that it takes everything in my power to remain present. The destre\nfor this kind of dying is so profound that I need you to remind me to play awake\nnow.\nWherever you are, dying is is a trick used to short circuit the deep attachments to\nthoughts and feelings about death. With practice, the linear thought, wherever you\nare, dying is shrinks to a dot. In other words it becomes possible to reduce the\nimage, which requires time and energy to produce, to a signal. Wherever you are.\ndying is, equals blip.\n\nAdmitting the constancy of dying relieves me from trying to identify it. I am\ntherefore free to appreciate a crucial present, throughout my body at once, as It\npasses.\n\nDying Is an Ignored activity.\nBecky Fox (an attorney and a participant in the workshop) -*Isn't it true that if, at\nsome level, one cannot acknowledge that one is in some way dying at every moment,\nthen, one is already dead to some aspect of being? Simply put, if you don't know\nyou're dying, you're already dead.\"\n\nI play awake in recognition of my attraction to die.\nSeeing impermanence is not about scanning one's visual feld. Seeing Imperma-\nnence requires admitting nothing I see is forever.\" From this perspective, wonders\nnever cease.",

The\nintention of the following\narticle and the photo captions\nis to present possible ways\nof experiencing and describing\nmovement. In Authentic\nMovement, the mover remains\nthe \"expert\" on his or her\nown movement experience—\nnot the viewer, nor the writer.\n[A.J.O.J]\n\n\nIn 1979 after seven years per-\nforming and teaching professionally\nas a dancer, I began writing a book\non dance chorcography. I wrote\nthirteen chapters (on rehearsal pro-\ncess, partnering, the use of space...)\nbefore I got to the section on \"move-\nment\" and realized I had nothing to\nsay. I was trained in the modern\ndance vocabularies of Martha Gra-\nham, José Limon, Erick Hawkins,\nand in ballet, but I had no idea how\nmy own movement was sourced. At\nthat point I met movement therapist\nJanet Adler who introduced me to\nAuthentic Movement. She was inter-\nested in working with dancers and\nchoreographers because she felt that\nmuch of what she saw in her studio\nwas more compelling than what she\nsaw on stage. Hence I began work-\ning in Authentic Movement and for\nover a decade have remained fasci-\nnated by its richness as a catalyst for\ncreative work and for healing.\nAuthentic Movement is derived\nfrom a process developed by Mary\nStarks Whitehouse which she often\nreferred to as \"movement in depth.\"\nMary was schooled in the dance\ntechniques of Mary Wigman and\nMartha Graham which invoked and\ngave form to energies and images\nfrom the unconscious. In the 1950s\nshe shifted her orientation from artis-\ntic to personal/developmental aspects\nof dance, and began her lifework\nexperiencing and describing the pro-\ncess of \"moving and being moved.\"!\nMary's work influenced many stu-\ndents and associates, including danc-\ners, therapists and educators, and is\ncurrently employed in diverse ways\nand in Europe. In 1981, two years\nafter Mary's death, Janet Adier\nformed the Mary Starks Whitehouse\nInstitute to further study and articu-\nlate ber experience of the \"discipline\nof authentic movement.\"'\nThe form for Authentic Move-\nment, as taught to me by Janet Adler,\nis simple: There is a mover and a\nThe mover closes her/his\neyes and waits for movement impuls-\nes—the process of being moved.\nThe body is the guide, and the mover\ntakes a ride on the movement impuls-\ncs as they emerge. The witness ob-\nserves, sustaining conscious aware-\nness of her/his own experience and\nof the mover. After a period of time,\nthe witness calls the movement ses-\nsion to a close, and there is a verbal\ndialogue about what occurred. The\nmover speaks, and then the witness\nreflects back her/his own experience\nof the session without judging it.\n\nUltimately the goal is to internalize a\ndiscerning but nonjudgmental witness\nwhile moving so that we can observe\nourscives without interrupting the\nnatural flow of our movement. In\nthis approach to Authentic Move-\nment, the form provides a container\nin which to practice entering uncon-\nscious material, returning to con-\nsciousness, and reflecting on or shap-\ning the experience through speaking\nor creative work.\nAuthentic Movement facilitates\nhealing as the body guides us into\nstored memories and experiences and\ntoward consciousness. Our history is\nstored in our body: evolutionary\nmovement patterns, human develop-\nmental reflexes, and personal experi-\nence. As we close our eyes and\nallow ourselves to be moved, endless\ndiversity emerges.\nMuch of what we correct in tech-\nnique class, for example, can be a\nresource in creative work or a call\nfor attention to physical healing. A\nlifted shoulder or a consistently twist-\ned spine may be indications of per-\nsonal history. Our imperfection is\nour gift. As we learn to listen to the\nlanguage of the body, we have a\nchoice about when and how to work\nwith a particular movement. Part of\ninjury and illness is the conflict be-\ntween what we tell our body to do\nand what it needs to do for healing,\nrecovery, expression, or safety. Part\nof healing is allowing the unex-\npressed to be expressed.\nAs we begin Authentic Move-\nment we may face basic fears: hatred\nof our body, fear of being empty\ninside, fear of stillness, fear of being\nalone, fear of not being loved.\ntoo fat, I'm too thin. If I'm not\nmoving, 1 don't exist. If I'm not\nseen, I'm nobody. If I don't do\nsomething good, nobody will love\nmc.\" Although these statements may\nseem harsh, they occur again and\nagain in movement sessions. As we\nclose our eyes and listen to our bod-\nics, there is also the potential of\naccepting ourselves just as we arc.\nAs we replace fear with open\nwaiting, we can learn how rich our\ninner world really is. Often students\nask why their first experience with\nAuthentic Movement is so serious,\ntheir first dances so sad. Generally\nwe push into the unconscious what\nwe consider to be negative-our sad-\nness, our meanness, our fear. But\nbelow that layer of unexpressed\nmovement is the wealth of human\nexperience. That is the resource\nfrom which we draw in Authentic\nMovement and which we hope to\nbring to the stage.\nAs we use Authentic Movement\nas a resource for choreography and\nperformance, we are developing a\ndialogue with our unconscious.\nBasically, there are different sources\nof movement which have been de-\nscribed as: the personal unconscious\n(personal story); the collective uncon-\nscious (transpersonal and crosscul-\ntural); or the superconscious (con-\nnected to energies beyond the self).'\nWithout limiting the spectrum of\nmovement possibility, we might note\nparticular modes of movement which\nemerge from these sources, including\nimpulses based purely in sensation\n(such as stretching or attending to an\ninjury), impulses based in reorienting\nour consciousness (such as spinning,\nwalking backwards, rolling), impulses\nbased in journeying (such as unfold-\ning a movement story), or those\nbased in emotionally charged or spir-\nitually transformative states available\nin the body (such as hearing or\nspeaking inner voices, ritual gestures,\nor visitations by specific characters).\nThese sources and modes are ways of\ndescribing different aspects of our\nmovement life, and are all part of the\nrange of Authentic Movement.\nWithin the experience of \"being\nmoved\" where the unconscious is\nspeaking directly through the body\nsome motions or positions will be\nunformed/hard to remember, some\ndeveloping, and others ready for\nconsciousness. Movement which is\n\"ready returns again and again, is\neasy to remember, and is available,\nin my experience, for creative form-\ning.\nMovement which is unformed or\ndeveloping needs time to unfold. As\nwe consider dancing for a lifetime,\nwe recognize that we have time to\ndevelop our creative and physical\nresources, so that we are not strip-\nmining our unconscious (using every\nmovement which emerges and put-\nting it on stage) or devouring the\nvital resources of our body (burn out\nnow because we only have so many\nyears to dance). Our body and our\nunconscious develop a dialogue with\nour conscious self-a pact of trust\nwhich is constantly being negotiated.\nFor example, in an injury of the\nspine or the ankle the muscles spasm\nto protect us from movement. (If we\ndidn't burt, we would move!) As the\nbody trusts that we will rest, the\nspasm can release. That is the nego-\ntiation.\nCan we trust ourselves? In per-\nsonal/developmental work, we have\nto know that a process of change can\nand will be supported. For example,\nif a difficult memory from childhood\nemerges in a movement session, the\nmover needs to trust that s/he has the\nresources and will take the time to\nintegrate the experience into con-\nscious awareness. Otherwise it is\nmore appropriate for the memory to\nremain unconscious. By internalizing\na supportive, nonjudgmental but\ndiscerning inner witness, we develop\nself-trust at a deep level.\nThe relationship between the\nmover and the witness parallels that\nof performer and audience. The\nmultiplicity of the human experience\nlives in each of us, and the stage\nprovides an opportunity to embody\nour inner selves by moving as per-\nformer, or by empathizing or project-\ning as witness. This transference of\nawareness between the audience and\nthe performer enables transformation\nfor both.' At first, the collective\nmind of the audience supports the\nsurrender of the performer to uncon-\nscious energies, but soon the audi-\nence surrenders its awareness of self\nand goes with the performer towards\ntransformation as well. In this con-\ntext, transformation becomes an\ninclusive experience. For example,\nin China during a solo concert, when\nI dropped my head, the heads in the\nroom would drop; when I lifted my\nfocus, the audience's focus would\nfollow my movement. Performance\nbecame an environment in which\npeople who were seeing could be\nmoved.\n\nIn my experience, if I am per-\nforming well, I am witnessing a\nmoving audience. I am holding the\nwitness role as dancer, and the audi-\nence is the mover, and I am support-\ning their journey. Thus, part of the\npractice of performing Authentic\nMovement is the practice of commu-\nnity. At these times, dance becomes\na vehicle for energies beyond the self\nwhich can be invited, or invoked, but\ncertainly not forced. This exchange\nexists as an aspect of \"being moved\"\nwhich is available to each of us.\nWithin the spectrum of collective\nexperience, there is a tremendous\nrelief both as a mover and as a\nwatcher as we realize that we are\nparticipants in a larger whole. If we\nare attentive to our unconscious, and\nothers to theirs, there is inherent\norder, unfolding, and relationship\nwhich occurs. Group work in Au-\nthentic Movement includes experienc-\nes of synchronicity, simultancity,\ncrosscultural motifs, feats of endur-\nance or strength, interactions with\nother people and other energies in the\nroom, extraordinary lifts, and dynam-\nics that could never be planned or\npracticed. Injuries are rare; if the\nbody and psyche are working as one,\nanything seems possible and true\nlimits are respected.\n\nEncountering others in group\nwork allows development of trust at\na profound level. The basic \"rule\" in\ngroup work, eyes closed, is that you\nfollow your own impulses.\nmoment of contact, the choice to\nmove with another person is based\non whether or not you can stay true\nto your own inner impulses while\nworking in contact with another\nperson. As each person follows his\nor her own impulses, no one is \"re-\nsponsible\" for taking care of anyone\nelse. We long to be seen for who we\nare in our totality, not for the limited\nview of who we present ourselves to\nbe, or who others imagine or want us\nto be. The practice of Authentic\nMovement in group work is the\npractice of being true to who we are\nin the presence of others.\nThere are several ways in which\nAuthentic Movement is useful in\nperformance. Authentic Movement\nInforms performance. Its practice\ngives us information about our own\npersonal movement material that\nhelps us decide whether to explore it\nfor ourselves in the studio, extend it\ninto therapeutic work, or bring it to\nthe stage. One of my earliest discov-\neries with Authentic Movement was\nhow much the body has to tell us.\nSimply by letting my body move me\ninstead of trying to control it, fasci-\nnating movement and useful insights\nwould emerge. I felt the expansive-\nness of my own vocabulary as a\ndancer, rather than wondering if I\ncould come up with one more evo-\ncative or unusual movement in the\nstudio. When I taught a group of\nstudents, the same richness was pres-\nent in each person's movement. It\nwas a humbling lesson in the univer-\nsality of individual uniqueness.\nAuthentic Movement also informs\nour viewing of dance. As we prac-\ntice witnessing we begin to recognize\nauthentic states and become aware of\nour own projection, noticing the\nextent to which what we are reading\ninto someone's movement is our own\nmaterial, how much is theirs, or how\nmuch is a shared state. Then we can\nmore clearly identify unconscious\ncontent in our own work—-read our\nown dances, and facilitate others to\nnotice their unique movement lan-\nguage. Whether Authentic Move-\nment is the criteria we want to use to\nwatch performance is a choice; it\ninforms, but it is only one of many\nways to view movement.\nAuthentic Movement is also a\nresource for performance. The\nongoing practice of Authentic Move-\nment provides a scrapbook of images\nmovements, and energetic states\nwhich can be drawn on in the cho-\nreographic process or in an improvi-\nsational performance. In my carly\nwork with Authentic Movement, I\nfelt that the practice gave me the\nemotional subtext for a dance. For\nexample, the first full-evening picce\nthat I created from Authentic Move-\nment was called In My House and it\nunfolded in its entirety in a one-\nmorning Authentic Movement ses-\nsion-seven sections with specific\nmovement vocabulary. I could de-\nvelop it any way I wanted, but the\nemotional and structural clarity had\nbeen established within me.\nFor performers, the practice al-\nlows movement patterns learned from\nothers to become integrated with\npersonal experience. Sessions also\nfacilitate a kind of house-cleaning of\nhabitual movement patterns which\nneed to be processed at the level of\nthe unconscious and released before\nbeginning new work.\nAuthentic Movement also exists\nas performance. An increasing\nnumber of dancers are presenting the\npractice of Authentic Movement in a\nperformance context. In questioning\nwhether the Authentic Movement\nexperience itself is transmittable or\nwhether it needs another form or\nframe to allow for transmission, I\nparticipated in an Authentic Move-\nment performance series with a core\ngroup of dancers who had worked\ntogether in Authentic Movement for\nmany years. We tried five monthly\nperformances and after each, one or\nmore of the performers was sick—\nwith the flu for example.\nWe had used Authentic Move-\nment in choreographed work quite a\nlot, and in other forms of improvisa-\ntion without problems, so we tried\nvariations to develop a safer contain-\ner for showing the work: adding\nmusic, having eyes open, having a\nwitness in the audience, having some\nperformers who were sourcing in a\nmore traditional dance mode, as well\nas presenting the pure practice as\nperformance. Eventually we consid-\nered two possible causes of the post-\nperformance illnesses: while perform-\ning we were merging with our watch-\ners and were not establishing bound-\naries, so we picked up whatever was\npresent emotionally and physically in\nthe room, overloading our systems;\nor we were exposing unconscious\nmaterial which needed the process of\ndialoguing directly afterwards for\ncompletion.\nWhether or not the raw authentic\nmovement state can be sustained and\ntransmitted in a performance setting,\nit is generally agreed that \"good\"\nperformance-choreography, improv-\nisation, authentic movement, etc.—is\nauthentic. It includes the sensation\nof moving and being moved, a merg-\ning of unconscious and conscious\nstates, and a moment by moment\nunfolding of the performer and the\nwork.\nAs Authentic Movement informs\nperformance, the underlying motive\nand hence the nature of performance\nchanges. There are years in perfor-\nmance when we may be driven by\nour need to be seen, when our ego\nseeks validation, when we must\nshape and control, when we desire to\ntransform and know other parts of\nourselves, or when we are compelled\nto create rituals of experience for\nothers. These motivations may\nchange during our lives as perform-\ners. Dancing at twenty is different\nthan dancing at forty or sixty.\nAt a mature level, a performer\nhas an articulate, discerning inner\nwitness which allows authentic con-\nnections to occur on stage. As we\ninternalize our own witness and lose,\nin effect, our need to be seen by\nothers, new performance motivations\narise. What might these be? The\npractice of being seen being authen-\ntic, in an era where the superficial\ntakes precedence. The practice of\nconnecting to energies beyond the\nself, in an era where spirituality is\nshapeless. The practice of participat-\ning in a community of exchange\nbetween dancers and watchers, in an\ncra where dance has been removed\nfrom most people's lives.\nAuthentic Movement points to a\nprocess of recognition between mov-\ner and witness, performer and audi-\nence. As we feel seen, we can see.\nAs we feel heard, we can begin to\nhear others. As we develop an artic-\nulate and supportive inner witness,\nwe can allow others their own expe-\nrience of moving and being moved.\nThe process of listening to the move-\nment stories of our body encourages\nus to know ourselves and to bring\nthis awareness to performance.\n\n\nTHE MOVER AND THE WITNESS.\nThe mover closes het/his eyes and waits\nfor movement impulses-the process of\nbeing moved. The witness holds the\nconsciousness and obsorvos. By intomal-\nizing a supportive, nonjudgmental witness,\nwe develop self-trust at a deep level.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS by Erik Borg were\ntaken in collaboration with colleagues\nDaphne Lowell, Caryn McHose, Joan\nMiller, Mary Ramsey, Susan Waltner,\nand Alton Wasson with whom I have\nworked in Authentic Movement during\nthe last decade, as part of an Authentic\nMovement Photo Project, June 1992,\npartially funded by an Ada Howe Kent\nResearch Grant from Middlebury Col.\nlege.\n\nCONTACT. In the moment of contact,\nthe choice to move with another person\nis based on whether or not you can\nstay true to your own inner impulses\nwhile working in contact with another\nperson. Encountering others in group\nwork allows development of trust at a\nprofound level.\n\nREORIENTATION. Movements which\ndisorient our consciousness-spinning.\nwalking backwards, rolling-stimulate\nreflexive responses, thus facilitating the\nprocess of entering unconscious states.\n\nTRANSFORMATIVE STATES (o.g.,\nhearing or speaking inner voices, ritual\ngestures, or visitations by specific char-\nacters). In these moments, dance is a\nvehicle for energies beyond the self\nwhich can be invited, or invoked, but\ncortainly not forcod.\n\nEMPATHIZING AND PROJECTING.\nThe multiplicity of the human experienco\nlives in each of us, and the stage provides\nan opportunity to embody our inner solves\ning or projecting as witnoss.\n\nSPEAKING. At the end of the movement\nsession, the mover may choose to speak,\ndraw, or in other ways give form to the\nexperience. The witnoss reflects back\nher/his own experience of the session. In\nAuthentic Movement, the form provides a\ncontainer in which to practice entering\nunconscious material, retuming to con-\nsciousness, and reflecting on or shaping\nthe experience through speaking or cre-\native work.

    "Content": "I'm struck by the timing of my father's death and the writing of this newsletter. I had wanted to\nfocus this issue on the experience of witnessing in Authentic Movement: the witnessing of ourselves and\ntho witnossing of others. I wrote on this subject for several weeks. Then my father's lymphoma took a\nsudden tum for tho worse and I was urgently called to New York to visit him in the hospital.\nAs I knelt by the foot of the bed gazing at this man with deep affection, I thought of the many hours spent\nwatching my students both moving and breathing in relative stillness. And the thought passed through my\nmind that all my work, my meditation and Authentic Movement practice, had propared me for this day;\nclarity of presence in the presence of my father dying. And as I often feel in my work, I felt the privilege\nand gift to be allowed to witness this intimate process.\nI watched the quality of Dad's broathing shift over the hours. For a while, his eyes were open and he\nsomed to bo looking back at mo. At times he would struggle, seem restless or pull at tha axygen mask.\nHis breath became noisy and gasping. I felt the pain of suffering and constriction in my own heart and\nlungs. Occasionally his efforts would be punctuated by a sigh and I would silently or softly offer him\nencouragement in relaxing.\nI'd look around at the others witnessing with me. My sister, Susan, had a look I'd never seen before, like a\nwoman in love. And I felt such relief when my other sister, Judith, finally arrived from Denmark.\nDad's breath suddenly shifted, his inhalations became long and gentle. I stood up and leaned over him.\nSoftly, I spoke the images in my mind. It's as if he's falling asleop. Look, his breathing is so gentle now.\nso easy. We all watched, completely present, witnessing this man with fuzzy gray hair around his temples.\nI falt so poacaful, so entranced. His breath lengthened and softened even more, like a ripple in the water\nflowing away. We watched as every hint of movement, of life itself, disappoared\nIn that moment a wail poured out of the group collected around the bod. While he was in his body, we had\nhold a serene space, but now that his spirit had left, we responded with our voicos all the feelings\ncontained insido,\nAs a witness, I could only imagine what it was like to die. I had so many questions / wanted to ask. What\nwere you experiencing as you tugged at the oxygon mask? Could you hear me when I whispered \"I love\nyou\" in your ear? What was it like to slip away? Was it as lovely as it soomed?\nSome days later I asked Susan if she thought Dad knew that Judith had arrived, Oh, yes, sho said, I saw\nhis chest relax with a big sigh. I asked Judith, too. Oh, yes, she said, I saw a tear form in the comer of\nhis eye.\nWitnessing is a special way of being with the self and being with another. We begin with an attitude of\nreverence, care and trust in the body and its wisdom. When I watch others move, I witness with my whole\nbody. I track not only the flow of events taking place in the room, but also the flow of response taking\nplace inside me in the form of sensations, thoughts, feelings and images. These are my own projections\nabout what might be going on for the mover, but they are secondary to remaining receptive and compas-\nsionate. I try to sense and hold the energy present in the room. As with my family, the sharing of\nexperience strongthens the fabric through which we feal connected to and supported by the world and\nthose around us.",

    "Abstract": "This article describes Women With Wings, a movement theater support group for HIV-positive women facilitated by Maria St. John.

The approach focuses on integrating embodiment and providing a space for shared experience and therapeutic support.",
    "Content": "A movement theater support group for HIV-positive women\n\n\n\nWomen With Wings was the name of a support\ngroup for HIV-positive women started by Anna\nHalprin in 1989, which I facilitated for three years.\nThe group changed its name three times (the final\nname was \"Body Talk\"), worked in at least four\ndifferent studios, and expanded and contracted as\nparticipants came and went. What remained con-\nsistent throughout was our commitment to attending\nto our bodies in order to be of use to one another\nin the face of the AIDS epidemic. This attention\nproduced the body-based therapeutic tools discussed\nhere. I wrote the paper shortly before the group\ndisbanded. A new group may begin soon, consist-\ning of a mix of old and new participants. [M.S.J.]\n\n\nStretch your arms and take hold of the cloth of your clothes\nwith both hands. The cure for the pain is in the pain.\nGood and bad are mixed.\nWhen one of us gets lost, is not here, he must be inside us.\n-Rumi\n\nWomen With Wings is a support group for HIV-posi-\ntive women. In addition to verbal support structures, the\ngroup uses movement and body-oriented theater exercises\nas tools for identifying, expressing, and working through\nissues which HIV infection evokes. This group is on-\ngoing. Participants commit to working with the group for\nat least four months, and are welcome to continue indefi-\nnitely after that. The group consists of a minimum of five\nand a maximum of ten participants at any given time.\nWomen With Wings was started by movement educator\nAnna Halprin, who works with people with cancer and\nHIV infection, using movement as an alternative treatment\nmethod or as an adjunct to more traditional Western medi-\ncal treatments. Halprin's original HIV group was made up\nof fifteen men and one woman. This single female partici-\npant felt that many of the issues surrounding HIV infection\nwere different for women than for men. She encouraged\nHalprin to start Women With Wings as a support group for\nHIV-positive women.\nThe group meets for three-hour sessions. We work in a\nlarge, empty dance studio with wooden floors and no\nmirrors. We begin each session with a verbal check-in.\nThis is followed by a guided meditation/relaxation exercise.\nFrom there the participants move into improvisational\nmovement explorations which I structure.\nThen there is a second verbal check-in, this one incorporating \nmaterial that has arisen in the movement work—-physical \nsensations, emotional states, and thought or image associations. \nFinally we use this material to create \"individual scores.\"\npants have a role in each score, although sometimes the\nrole is simply to \"witness\" and then discuss the others'\nwork. A role could be any of the following: a body part\n(so that an ailing body part would have a voice, for exam-\nple), a \"voice\" one hears inside (so that internalized atti-\ntudes, assumptions, and expectations can be identified and\naddressed), or a person (so that a difficult family or social\nsituation can be role-played). A score can be elaborately\ndesigned or largely improvised. After performing each\nwas designed to address.\nWhat follows is a discussion of three major functions\nwhich this therapeutic approach serves for the participants.\nIntegrating embodiment\nThe first time the group assembled, there was an over-\nwhelming feeling of relief at being together in one place as\nHIV-positive women. Although each participant has by\nnow integrated into her sense of herself a feeling of be-\nlonging to this community, there are still times when sim-\nply being together physically seems to provide the most\nvital therapeutic element.\nDuring one session the participants felt that the initial\ngroup movement exercise was meeting a crucial need.\nThey didn't want to follow our usual pattern of working on\neach person's individual material during the second half of\nthe session. As we discussed how we might continue to\nexplore movement which expressed the group-as-a-whole,\none participant had the image of everyone moving as if she\nwere part of the internal works of a big clock. Everyone\nwas attracted to this image and as we explored it in our\nOne of the effects of HIV infection is that the women\nlive with a constant sense of an accelerated biological clock\nor a time bomb ticking in their ears. They wanted to use\nthe time they had together simply to listen to their own\nrhythms, move to their own ticking, take their own sweet\ntime.\nThey spent the rest of the session moving together.\nThe movement began mechanically, inspired by the clock-\nwork image. The strong pulsing rhythm they established\nsoon gained momentum and they moved into looser, fuller\nmovement expression that built to a frenzied crescendo.\nFinally they slowed down and rested together, listening to\none another's breathing. It was one of our most wordless\nsessions, and it is remembered by the group as one of the\nmost profound.\nBypassing language altogether and working exclusively\nwith our physical bodies is not, however, the primary\npurpose of the group. Rather, we assume with Joyce\nMcDougall that emotions form \"the privileged link between\npsyche and soma,' and we work with language to describe\nthese connections. A network of feedback loops is attend-\ned to and expressed in which physical sensations provide\naccess to emotional states, linguistic associations uncover\npsychic struggles, and verbal and nonverbal explorations\ngive way to previously suppressed, repressed or denied ele-\nments of experience.\nTwo examples will demonstrate the functioning of these\nprocesses. Connie was working one day with the theme of\na relationship she had determined to end. She had just that\nmorning given her lover an ultimatum (\"give me what I\nneed from you or I'm leaving\") to which she was afraid\nthat she herself might not adhere, compromising instead in\ncompliance with a self-defeating pattern.\nConnie was harshly scornful of herself for this antici-\npated failure. She stood in the middle of the studio floor\nannouncing bitterly, \"I'm so tired of myself. I've been\nhere before. I know I'll just end up going back to her.\" I\nasked her (as I often do) to move while she spoke. She\nwas annoyed at my request (in spite of its usualness!) and\nsaid with some irritation that she couldn't move because\nshe had a pain in her side.\nI asked her to put her hands on the place where she felt\nthe pain. She did, and then looked at me expectantly. I\nasked her, \"What's there?\" My love handles,\" she re-\nsponded promptly, and as though it were a stupid question.\nThen she heard her own words and began to cry, connect-\ning with the strong feeling that had so far been inaccessible\nto her. The phrase \"love handles,\" she explained, captured\nthe strong sense of attachment she felt to her lover. Her\nlover \"had a hold of her\" in a very real way. Realizing\nthis afforded Connie the self-compassion she needed in\norder to tolerate the painful ambivalence of a potential\nbreakup.\nA similar example is more directly HIV-related. Maya\nwas working with the theme of her chronic fatigue. In her\nscore she enacted a fantasy she had of her own funeral. At\nthe funeral someone gave a culogy in which they listed all\nthe things Maya had done in the three years since she\ntested positive. (The list was extensive, including commu-\nnity service work, AIDS organizing, career changes, travel,\nrelationships, and athletics. These were all things Maya\nhad in fact been doing since testing positive.)\nMaya delivered the list in a monotone voice with an\nexpressionless face. In the middle of the monologue she\nstopped abruptly and asked in distress, \"Why doesn't all\nthis sound impressive to me? It scems like, so what? It\nseems like nothing.\" I asked her where in her body she\nfelt her fatigue. \"My lungs,\" she answered without hesita-\ntion. I asked her to speak from there. She spoke as her\nlungs. They said to her, \"You never stop. We expand and\nthen contract and than rest for a beat. You never rest. We\nneed you to rest with us. We can't do this without you.\"\nLike Connie, Maya cried as she connected with this\npart of herself that had been silenced. Her fear of her\nfatigue had been so great that she had hardly allowed\nherself to rest. She could not fully enjoy or take pride in\nher accomplishments because they were motivated in part\ndo. When she gave voice to her own weary body, and\nlistened to it, she was able to have compassion for the\nfatigue instead of fear and hatred. In my process notes that\nday 1 reflected,\nIt is this difficulty in laying oneself down the fear\nthat it will be the beginning of the end, that it will\nmean admitting defeat, losing control, that one will\nnever rise again-this seems to me to be the most\nharrowing part of living with HIV.\nIndeed, remembering to rest is typical of the kinds of\nmessages the participants take from our sessions. The\ngroup supports one another in attending to their bodies,\npaying attention to their own (evolving) powers and limits,\nand taking their own psychic processes as their guides.\nThese practices are crucial because, as the group's state-\nment of purpose describes,\nThere are a lot of people with a lot of ideas about\nhow we should and should not live our lives as\nHIV-positive women. Our bodies are the battle-\ngrounds for raging political wars and the screens\nfor overwhelming cultural projections.\nThere is no right way to live with HIV infection, but\nthere are countless decisions to be made. One participant\nrecently decided to stop taking AZT because she felt she\nhad been sick more frequently on it than she would have\nbeen had she not taken it in the first place. Her doctor\nadvised her to continue with it, insisting that her nausea\nand beadaches were not side effects, but stress-related\nsomatizations. The participants of Women With Wings use\nthe work to explore their own relationships to HIV, to\ndefine their own treatment plans, and to find their own\npaths through the confusing cultural construction of AIDS.\n\n///\n\n\"We are HIV-positive women. We come\ntogether to create community because we\nare isolated around HIV-related issues in\nmany areas of our lives. Although our life\nsituations, our identities, and our approach-\nes to living with HIV vary greatly, we are\ncommitted to supporting one another in turn-\ning to our own bodies and our own psyches\nas our authorities.....\n\n///\n\nPracticing disorientation\n\nThere are many details and dimensions of HIV disease,\nhowever, that cannot be decided or controlled. As impor-\ntant as it is for the participants of Women With Wings to\nuse their work together to find their way, their constant\ngetting lost in it is perhaps ultimately the most important\npart of the work.\nIt is in this respect that I take issue with certain psy-\nchotherapists who work with people with AIDS. Cohen\nand Abramowitz, for example, assert that \"the psychothera-\npeutic challenge is to help the person with AIDS to maxi-\nmize the cobesiveness, firmness and vitality of the embat-\ntled, destabilized self.\"* On the contrary, an important part \n\nof the work the women do together in Women With Wings\nis about making room for the not-firm, not-cohesive and\neven the not-vital parts of themselves.\nFor example, Maxine dances sitting down when her\nneuropathy causes her unbearable pain in her legs. Connie\nspent an entire score curled in fetal position, repeating over\n\"No more pills. I won't swallow any more\npills.\" Louise wondered one day why she felt compelled to\nmove with her arms raised above her head. She thought\nshe must be reaching for something but she couldn't figure\nout what it would be. Upon further exploration she discov-\nered that the gesture meant instead, \"I give up.\"\nWe work with improvisation in the group because it\nentails a perpetual opening up to the unknown, the unex-\npected, the unfamiliar, and often the undesired. What\narises in an improvisation is often that thing that has been\nrelegated to the unconscious precisely because bringing it\nto consciousness seems painful or dangerous. When one\nimprovises, one accepts as the norm a state of being lost.\nWe move into our blind spots, we back into our fears, we\nturn into our monsters and our mothers.\nIn her description of a particular approach to improvisa-\ntion, contact improvisor Nancy Stark Smith says,\nImprovisation is a practice in disorientation-train-\ning the reflexes to read confusion as a challenge,\nnot a threat-that a moment eur loose from its\nmoorings has the advantage of being able to move\nin any direction, and further, that a temporary\nabsence of reference points can clear the way for\nimpulses from unexpected quarters.\"'\nPracticing disorientation is as crucial to women living with\nHIV as striving for stability or clarity may be. We proceed\noften from a point of blindness in Women With Wings.\nWe move into an empty room with nothing but our unpre-\ndictable bodies, and we respond to what arises. In a partic-\nular movement exploration, Helene found herself moving\nas a sand crab scurrying around looking for a rock. She\nsaid in the discussion,\nEvery time I get sand all around me and get settled\nanother wave comes in the form of an HIV-related\narticle in the paper or a new drug that doesn't\nwork or somebody making a comment in line at the\ngrocery store, and all the sand is swept away again\nand there I am vulnerable and exposed, scurrying\nfor shelter.\n\nHolding ambiguity\nClosely related to this practice in disorientation is the\nfinal function of the body-based interventions I will address\nhere: holding ambiguity.\nHIV infection often seems to confirm in women a\ndeeply felt sense of shame and defectiveness. Self-repudia-\ntion in the form of hatred for one's body is common\namong women but may be concretized and apparently\nrationalized by HIV infection. A frequent response (for\nboth HIV-positive and HIV-negative women) is to become\nradically alienated from our bodies to punish, endanger,\ninjure, starve and mutilate them, and to refuse to listen to\nthem, care for them, or see them as part of us; in effect, to\ndisown them.\nThis tendency toward alienation can be reinforced by\nthe alien quality an infected body can take on. T-cell\ncounts hover or dip for no traceable reason and with no\npalpable effects. The body comes to represent the potenti-\nality of unfathomable suffering and loss. Our faces are\nrubbed in what has for most of us been the infuriating and\nhumiliating fact that we cannot control our bodies.\nThe path of HIV disease is completely unpredictable.\nSome people remain asymptomatic. There have been\nreported cases of people testing positive and subsequently\ntesting negative. Some people get sick and then get better\nfor many years. Some people move rapidly from good\nhealth to death. To live with an HIV-infected body is to\nlive with ambiguity. Brenda spent her first few months with the group feel-\ning painfully awkward in her body, very self-conscious and\nunable to be spontancous. One day she called me between\nsessions and told me she thought she should drop out of\nthe group because she was less \"talented\" than anyone else\nand she felt she was a hindrance to the group. We dis-\ncussed the possibility of her coming and working in the\ngroup with these feelings of inadequacy.\nShe did continue and during the next session I noticed\nthat whenever she moved at all, Brenda kept her head as\nstill as possible. I pointed this out to her and suggested\nthat she engage her head with the movement of the rest of\nher body. Her movement became strikingly full and free,\nto her own rather shy delight.\nIn discussing her experience she talked about the fact\nthat \"keeping her head out of the movement\" had kept her\nfrom identifying with her own body, and had maintained\nher in a harshly critical relationship with it. Engaging her\nhead in the movement allowed her to experience herself as\na moving body. She said, \"I left my body when I contract-\ned the virus and I haven't felt in it until today.\"\nBrenda experienced herself here as a body rather than\nas having a body. This enabled her to open up to the\npleasurable and liberating sensations to which her body is\nuniquely able to provide access. She had been depriving\nherself of these experiences because she could only repre-\nsent her body to herself in negative ways (as clumsy, bad,\ndirty, damaged, etc.). Her work in this session marked the\nbeginning of her process of negotiating new representations\nof and to herself.\nHelene's story offers another example of how body-\noriented group work can assist participants in learning to\nhold the ambiguity which the body represents. During her\nfirst session with the group. Helene expressed her relief\nthat Women With Wings wouldn't be \"one more group\nwhere everybody sits around complaining and getting each\nother down.\" She was so insistent upon maintaining a\n\"positive attitude\" that when Maya said in her check-in\n\"my boyfriend's sexism is killing me,\" Helene interrupted\nto ask \"could you please not use that expression, 'killing\nme'?\" She could stand to entertain only positive affirma-\ntions. Her hates and dreads were strictly banished from her\nconscious experience.\nAlthough we have not addressed Helene's original\nintolerance for ambiguity directly, it is clear to me from\nher work that some staggering changes have taken place in\nher. In her individual score last week Helene worked with\nthe image of a beautiful, old, overgrown graveyard which\nshe had discovered on a walk. The participants were to\n\nrepresent the gravestones and she was to be the wind blow-\ning around them.\nIn this score the participants were literally cmbodying\nthe potentiality of death for Helene, and she was dancing\namong them. Simply through being with the other partici-\npants in a way that is attentive to bodies has allowed\nHelene to be with the ambiguity that HIV infection makes\ncorporal. I am reminded of T.S. Eliot's description of\nembodying ambiguity in The Four Quartets. He says,\nI said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope\nFor hope would be hope for the wrong thing;\nwait without love\nFor love would be love of the wrong thing;\nthere is yet faith\nBut the faith and the love and the hope\nare all in the waiting.\nWait without thought, for you are not ready for\nthought:\nSo the darkness shall be the light,\nand the stillness the dancing.\nClosing Thoughts\nHIV infection often amplifies for women deeply rooted\nambivalences in relation to their bodies which are fostered\nthrough gender-specific socialization processes. Paradoxi-\ncally, while HIV infection may exaggerate a woman's\nsense of alienation from her body, it also forces her to\nreckon with her own embodiedness in new ways. Some\nwomen are able to take on their bodies consciously as they\nnever have before and thereby to conceive new and more\ncompassionate self-representations.\nTherapeutic work which attends to bodily experience\nand addresses it on its own terms (i.e., which \"speaks\"\ndirectly to the body as well as \"listening\" to it) is uniquely\nable to assist in this process. By responding to one another\nspecifically as embodied subjects, women can enact a\nreparation of the aspects of ourselves which have been\nculturally severed and devalued.\n\n\n\"...For three hours on alternate Sunday\nafternoons we gather to make our way\nthrough. We move together, reading our\nbodies for our current impulses, sensations\nand desires. We talk and we sing, articulat-\ning the multitudes of voices within. We ex-\nplore the constantly shifting landscapes of\nour imaginations and associations. We en-\nact together scenes from our psyches, mov-\ning always toward the openings.

    "Abstract": "Steve Paxton reflects on the challenges of defining Contact Improvisation, particularly as it evolves beyond its experimental origins. He grapples with how to describe the corporeal experience, acknowledging its complex interplay of social, physical, and personal information. He explores the body's innate responsiveness to images and the potential for using 'real' images to influence movement and sensory awareness.",
    "Content": "How awkwardly we are damned if we don't or if we\ndo. I thought to myself after the European Contact Confer-\nence in Berlin in 1988. During a lecture event I had been\nasked, \"Just what is Contact Improvisation?\" and I had\nmuffed the answer. I was being asked by a woman with an\nattitude, in the presence of a number of veteran contactors,\ngeneral public, and students, and I hesitated in order to think\nhow the question should be answered for the whole group.\nThe discussion up to that point had been full of historical\nrevisions, elisions, pointed remarks about Americentric\nheavy-footedness. In short, the European contactors consid-\nered themselves second generation users of this form and\nwanted to know if they had to go through every step the\nAmericans had gone through; and a few people who had\ncome to the conference without prior experience just want\nan explanation of what this whole thing was and how it was\nrun and how did one improve and get recognition-things\nlike that, which would be reasonable questions in a normal\norganization.\nThe journal you are now reading had, among other things,\nbeen working for 15 years to elaborate on the basic answer\nto \"what is CI?\" And as time has gone on, the answer has\nshifted: away from an experimental dance phenomenon and\ntoward a physical practice allied with a number of complex\nnew body and mind studies. I have come to think of contact\nimprovisation as a physical event best described negatively—\nnot art, not sport, not most of the things which characterize\ndancing in this century.\nBut I hate to describe things in the negative. It is\naccurate, but the mystics used it first and I don't like using\ntheir devices, which were used to try to inform students in\nconversations about the ineffable.\nWe, on the other hand, are trying to describe the corpore-\nal. But it is no longer easy to do so. It is, in fact, getting\nmore difficult. We now know too much, or think we do; the\ncorporeal seems to be a complexity of social, physical,\ngeometric, glandular, political, intimate, and personal infor-\nmation which is not easily renderable.\nOnce things were relatively simple. I thought I knew how\nthis then-nameless work should not be described. It was to\nbe an improvisation without any ambiguous appeals to the\nimagination, because I did not know precisely what \"the\nimagination\" was (in fact I thought doing this work might\neducate me to the meanings of imagination, improvisation\netc.). For the same reason there should be no mention of\nsexuality, psychology, spirituality. I would leave these in the\nhands of the experts and proceed with what seemed more\nimmediate-the senses and the physical body.\nIt did seem that before I could begin to train the senses of\nstudents, something had to happen in their brains.\nrecognizing that we do not begin to move from zero, that first\nwe have a desire or image to launch the system into action,\nI decided that I had to work in the area of images, though\ncautiously. The images were to be, well, \"real.\" That is,\nthey were not to be obviously unreal.\nThe effect of obviously unreal images upon the body is\nfascinating. For example, if you are told to imagine (that\nword!) your head is filled with a gas that's lighter than air,\nit is difficult not to respond with neck extension and postura\nstraightening. Why should this be so?\nIt may be related to the sort of mobilization which\nhappens when we are searching for a lost object-first, the\nthought of the object, then the eye movements, the head\nturning, standing up, facing in different directions, a tentative\nwalk to a new viewpoint or a possible site of the object. All\nthis prompted by the mental image of the desired object.\nThe responsiveness of the body to the image is innate,\napparently, and with this innate connection the body may be\nresponsive to any image the mind holds. But this is specula-\ntion about things which should be the subject of investiga-\nWithout a theory of imagination to support our\ninvestigations, it seemed to me, we would have to improvise\nwithout fictitious gasses in the head—if that were possible.\nAt any rate, I had only about a weck to come to convey\nthe central idea before we, a group of apt students and\nmyself, would be doing it in public at the John Weber\nGallery in NYC each afternoon. This time pressure meant\nthat this effect of images on the body would be an essential\ntool for quickly transmitting the initial states which would let\nthis physical duct/improvisation manifest as directly as\npossible.\nThe first job was to point out this image-action connec-\ntion. Then, exercises which demonstrate it in various parts\nof the body had to be produced. For instance, a mental\nexercise I gave while people were standing, in which they\nwere to \"imagine, but don't do it, imagine that you are about\nto take a step forward with your left foot. What is the\ndifference? As you were. Imagine... (repeat). Imagine that\nyou are about to take a step with your right foot. Your left.\nRight. Left. Standing.\"\nAt this point, small smiles sometimes appeared on\npeople's faces and I suspected they felt the effect. They had\ngone on an imaginary walk and had felt their weight respond-\ning subtly (but really) to the image; so when \"Standing\" was\nsaid, the smiles revealed that they got the small joke. They\nrealized that I knew about the effect. We had arrived at an\ninvisible (but real) place together.\nThe stand was useful. The basic event was standing and\nobserving the body. This was an exercise in itself, though\na very reductive one. What gets exercised in there, inside the\nstanding body, is the habit of observation; a noticeable\nmovement of consciousness through the body. Within this\nexercise there are encounters with parts of the body which\ntick along or breathe along as we watch. It clearly seems to\nbe one sub-system, consciousness, examining others.\nThe other sub-systems are not obviously connected to the\nwandering consciousness, except that the encounter happens\nin what one calls \"my body.\" The consciousness-as-observer\nregards the other sub-systems as separate from itself.\nThe consciousness can travel inside the body. It is\nanalogous to focusing the eyes in the external world. There\nis also an analogue for peripheral vision, which is the\nawareness of the whole body with senses open. Knowing\nthese things and practicing them are different things, of\ncourse. We know far more than we can practice. We had to\ndecide what to practice.\n\nOne choice was the tiny movements the body makes while\nstanding. I felt they were examples of reflex actions. They\nwere not directed by the observing consciousness. Observ-\ning them might train the consciousness to understand reflex\nspeed without going through an emergency experience which\nis when we're most often aware of our reflexes.\nWe would be provided with many examples of reflex\naction when we began improvising in contact, but they might\nbecause the consciousness can easily\nturn off to the experience of these reflexive moments. In\nother words, we can do something without \"knowing\" it.\nThis successfully preserves the integrity of the body but does\nnot train the consciousness; it leaves a hole in the knowing\nof the experience. Could the consciousness learn to see these\ngaps of awareness? Or, if not, could it at least learn to\nobserve reflexive action calmly during the highly adrenalized\nWhy is full consciousness so important to me? Because\nconsciousness can be felt to change according to what it\nexperiences. If a gap of consciousness occurs at a critical\nmoment, we lose an opportunity to learn from the moment.\nA black-out lasting fractions of a second during a roll is not\nacceptable as full consciousness of the roll, and the gap will\nremain embedded in the movement as part of the over-all\nfeeling of the movement. If consciousness stays open during\nthese critical moments, it will have an experience of them,\nand will enlarge its concept to match the new experience.\nThis expanded picture becomes the new ground for moving.\nMy speculation is that the gaps are moments when\nconsciousness goes away. I don't know where. But I think\nI know why. Something is happening which is too fast for\nthought. For instance, the navigation of space is normally\ndone with head erect and visual impressions comfortably\nconstant, with the horizon's horizontality remaining an\nimportant reference for our orientation. When this visual\nreference changes too rapidly for our (rather slow) conscious-\nness to comprehend, as in spinning, rolling, and other\n\"disorienting\" movement, something reflexive and much\nfaster than consciousness takes over. We play with this dual\naspect of ourselves on carnival rides, or when learning to turn\nDizziness and nausea are, I think, signals that we have\nreached the borderland between these two aspects of physical\ncontrol-conscious and reflexive. When we linger in the\nborderland on purpose, we become our own experiment. We\nare subjecting the reflexes to stimuli so our consciousness can\nwatch them jump. Normally, consciousness easily slips out\nreflexes step in, and then step aside again, as in the blink of\nan eye where most of the time we are unaware of any gap in\nour visual continuity.\nVisual continuity is one of many ways we know \"where\nwe are,\" and not knowing where we are is experienced as an\nemergency situation. How many times a day, or an hour, do\nwe re-orient, I wonder. At any rate, contact improvisation\nconstantly challenges one's orientation: visual, directional,\nbalance, and where in the body the consciousness is posi-\ntioned. The challenge to orientation is not just in the more\nacrobatic aspects of the movement. Students were sometimes\nmade nauseous by noticing their internal space while standing\nstill. This, oddly enough, is probably a form of motion-\nsickness, which has been described as having a moving deck\nunder one's feet but a steady horizon. In the stand, one\nexperiences still feet and moving consciousness inside the\nbody. In rolling or turning, the room seems (from the point\nof view of the eyes) to move, while the floor remains stable\nto the touch. What I had to do was resolve the problem of\norientation so that the consciousness could stay aware of the\nmovement. A chicken and egg problem\n\nEveryone in this group was athletic and many of them\nwere dancers, so presumably their consciousness had already\nbeen informed by body movement. But they weren't being\nasked to do what they knew how do to. They were being\nasked to improvise; to do (or allow themselves to do) what\nthey didn't expect to do. Under these circumstances previ-\nously learned movement techniques often hamper rather than\nhelp the desired sort of manifestation. Movement techniques\nare useful for other reasons, of course, but not for examining\ngaps of consciousness during unexpected movement.\nConsciousness, supported by a collection of images and\ninternal observations which reinforced each other, had a job.\nIt should not press the body, nor engage in time travel out\nof the body into memories or schedules because these bring\nimages which will also affect the body, distracting from the\nimprovisation at hand. In this improvisation the conscious-\nness was to hang in with the body, during real time, and stay\nalert. It should be a witness.\nThis sort of consciousness-awareness of the present\nphysical reality— is familiar to all of us. In fact the reason\nit is useful is that it is commonly understood, though employ-\ning it requires choices. Without a process of sorting we are\nconfronted with such a variety of current physical images that\nwe are inundated rather than guided into a practice\n\nAs the right kind of images were found, a working model\nbegan to emerge in my mind. The working model was based\non aspects of an experience that I'd had while working with\nanother person, in which an interesting event occurred and\nwas confirmed by both of us. Moments of the duet, typically\nmanifesting as \"accidental\" and flowing streams of move-\nment, were for both of us pleasant, highly stimulating, and\nelemental. With other partners, more confirmations. It was\nworth pursuing.\nThe working model was predicated on this experience and\na desire to articulate the experience so others could find it.\nIf others did find it, we were perhaps examining a basic\nmode of communication between the reflexes of people in\nphysical contact as they moved. It was an idea which took\ntwo people to have. It wasn't wrestling, embracing, sex,\nsocial dancing, though it was an element of all of those. It\nneeded a name, so we could refer to it without unwanted\nconnotations. Contact Improvisation...?\nTo envision the exercises, I took the working model to be\na simple imaginary person with no physical, sensorial, or\nsocial inhibitions. It was a generic person with positive\nelements I had observed in many students, dancers, martial\nartists, and children. I had met such a being in my partners\nwhen we were doing \"it,\" the duet phenomenon. I had been\nsuch a being to them, apparently, when they too confirmed\nthe moment. It had to be a fairly simple model, because the\nusers (the students and I) were actually functioning human\nbeings with more possible neuronal connections than there are\nparticles in the universe. I could not cope with that of\ncourse, nor other evident human complexities. In terms of the\nsafety of the body in active interaction with another body,\nthough, I saw I could ask the student to concentrate on\nmovement and how it feels, and then suggest concentrating\non the sensations of their weight, momentum, friction, the\ntouch of their partner, the sensation of the floor under their\nbody, and to lear to maintain their peripheral vision of the\nspace. The working model had these characteristics and\nothers equally easy to understand. These were aimed at\nsecurity, not at improvising. I recall saying that improvising\ncould not be taught, though it could be learned.\nBut I did think that safcty could be taught. \"Keep your\nknees over your toes,\" for instance, is taught to students of\ndance. With the characteristics of the working model\ndeveloped and understood by the students, I hoped they\nwould be safe even if they were ass-over-teakettle.\nI pressed on. I made assumptions. I assumed I could\nexplain things directly to the body (\"notice gravity\"). I\nassumed the body knew what I was talking about (gravity,\nusually ignored, moves into focus as a sensation of weight).\nI assumed that the body, having evolved for millions of\nyears on this planet, was tuned first by planetary things which\ncreate our potentials, and second by cultural things which\ndevelop select parts of the potential. This is in line with\nsome current theories about how we acquire language; we are\nborn with potential to make the variety of human sounds and\nlanguage connections, but are guided into the specific \nlanguage of our culture, and the unused potential withers with\ndisuse.\nFor the working model, the basic question was— potential\nfor what? What had the culture physically suppressed or\nselected out which we might reclaim? We may, with a bit of\nexperience of sub-cultures of our own, and other cultures,\nunderstand something of what our culture requires of us for\ninclusion: certain gestures, modes of posture and behav-\nior-body language, as they say-which constitute proper\nsocial activities and communications, as well as the accompa-\nnying mental attitudes we acquire or aspire to for proper\npresentation of our 'selves'. Indeed, the very idea of a 'self'\nis probably a cultural construction.\nIn sports and dance the rules of physical behavior are\naltered from the basic social behaviors to encompass activities\nunderstood to be outside the social norm but allowable in a\ncontrolled way. These activities require different sensing\nmodes than does the usual body language we must learn for\neating in company or attending school. The working model\nand its characteristics were like sports and dance in that they\nwere altered. However, they depart from one another in how\nthey are learned. Contact Improvisation behavior evolves\nfrom sensing movement; dance and sports, from attempting\nmovement and then letting the senses fall into line, or not\nAs to how we are educated... Not to become too em-\nbroiled in this, we may simply note that most of us learn to\nsit still and focus our attention for hours each day.\nmissing potential here is obvious - movement of the body and\nvarieties of peripheral sensing.\nOur alterations involved the investigation of space, time,\nand mass with senses in peripheral sensing mode: space\nbecomes spherical, time is the present, mass is a changeable\norientation to gravity.\nIn devising an approach to this working model of the\nbody, I skipped blithely by constraints and taboos of touch-\ning, because people are accustomed to ignoring them on the\nsubway, during sports, or in the doctor's office. And I did not\nemphasize the unpredictable nature of the improvisation, akin\nto dancing on constantly shifting ground, but suggested\ninstead a steady state of watching the reflexes. Let the\nreflexes figure out how to deal with the unpredictable.\nThis method aimed to reclaim physical possibilities which\nmay have become dormant, senses we have been trained to\ndisregard. What would this lead to, really? It sounds very\nnice, this reclaiming and opening, but where would these\nchanges take us? Who would we be?\nWhen we began, in 1972, I went boldly into all this. The\npeople in the group were young, healthy, and alert. I\nassumed that if we didn't consciously focus on problems we\nwouldn't create them, and at least such difficulties as\nsurfaced would not have been projected. As I said carlier,\nthings seemed simpler then.\nIt was to be assumed that some of these students would\neventually teach something of what they were doing to\nothers, and I felt the need to develop this material in such a\nway that the students were aware of the teaching mecha-\nnisms. It boiled down to making the principles physical,\nmental, and cultural-known to them as they learned them.\nWe had the services of Steve Christiansen and his video\ncamera and spent hours, when we were not working on the\nmat, examining the movement and ourselves, the movers.\nThis was very useful. Video was, in those days, a new\ntool for witnessing the body/mind, and let us see points in\naction when we were operative but not conscious. Such\nmoments, noticed with the help of the videotape or close\nobservation by a partner, could later be examined in action.\nClues about the nature of the gap might be noticed. We\nbegan to notice where the gaps appeared, at any rate, and\nsomething of their frequency. We also noticed high unfet-\ntered moments (and recalled the accompanying feelings).\nAnd we observed fettered duets where reflexive movement\nwas not to be seen. Sometimes people seemed wary, unable\nto let go of conscious control. Disorientation, fear, or fixod\nhabitual responses would be noticed.\nIn the working model, events of the emotions and disori-\nentations which were felt in conjunction with a gap in\nawareness were considered to be symptomatic that the senses\nwere not quite ready to report what was happening to the\nconsciousness, that instead they were reporting to the\nreflexive part of the mind and body.\nI couldn't understand the wary duets. Obviously trust was\nmissing. With some other partner or on some other day, this\ntended to change. All I could do to cope with this mode was\nto have partners change regularly. Eventually everyone found\na duet which led them to their reflexes.\nWhen I proposed movement techniques they sometimes\ncontravened ingrained movement habits: for instance, the\naikido roll, which is a diagonally forward roll that arrived on\nour shores from the Orient. At the very attempt at this roll,\nstudents translated it into a somersault, the symmetrical\nforward roll we learn in Western movement. This misunder-\nstanding could persist through any number of repetitions of\nexamples and attempts and was seriously frustrating to both\nthe students and me. If they couldn't put their finger on what\nwas going wrong. I decided, it was perhaps because nothing\nin previous movement experience had prepared them for the\nmovement principles which were developed in the Eastern\nmartial arts.\nThese repeated attempts at the aikido roll provided the\nfirst gap I noticed. The act of propelling the body into the\nroll is slightly scary, and many people have open eyes before\nand after the roll, but in the moment when they are taking\nweight on their neck and shoulders, they have their eyes\nsqueezed shut, and they are not aware that this is so.\nI did not solve this two-part problem in time for the first\nperformance, nor for many years after, though the students\ndid perfect their somersaults.\nI learned that before the body could find the new rolling\npattern it was useful for it to learn the sensations which an\naikido roll creates.\nThe new sensations, and the parts of the arm, shoulder,\nand back where the sensations arise in the roll, could be\nexplored without committing the whole body to the roll. This\nchanged the position of the consciousness relative to the\nexercise. Instead of an unknown action vs. an habitual\nknown action which is so similar that it subverts the attempt,\nthe student has two knowable actions. One is new, tentative,\nbut understood through the sensorial model. The other is\nhabitual. Having remedied the first difficulty by establishing\nthe difference between the two concepts of rolling, the gaps\nof consciousness in either could be ferreted out.\nThese explorations evolved into new technical approaches.\nIt was noticeable that the approaches require that the student\nwork with helpful mental attitudes as well as directly with the\nphysical body. In the aikido roll example above, it was less\nhelpful to know the pattern mentally and try willfully to do\nit than it was to become an observer of the sensations and to\nwork calmly on each emotional, orientational, or habitual\nblock as it arose.\nThe quality of consciousness was coming into focus. It\nwasn't all of consciousness and all possible interactions, of\nc o u r s e .\nA working model for consciousness in this case is\nSwiss cheese. We buy it as a lump, and don't attend to the\nholes because we don't use them. I was trying to point to the\nholes, assuming that if a Swiss cheese could be aware of\nitself, then the cheesy part was one sort of consciousness and\nthe holes were another sort, integral to the shape, the nature\nof the whole cheese. We can't take this model much further,\nI realize; which may be to the advantage of getting on with\nthe movement and its interaction with the consciousness.\nAs we began work on opening up the senses to their\nlarger potential, it became clear that each of the senses has\nimages of differing natures. The Swiss cheese above, mostly\na visual image in that I am concentrating on how the cheese\nlooks, occurred in my brain and was transferred to another\nperson by my voice, so it was a verbal transmission of a\nvisual image. What was most needed in our work was\nkinetic imagery which was both appropriate to the movement\nmode and true (unlike the speculation about the consciousness\nof the cheese).\nThe small movements of standing \"still,\" which formed\nthe basis of this sort of investigation, are true; they are really\nthere. But are they images or sensations? If we observed\nthem, would they filter through the observing mind and affect\nthe body as images do? Does the nervous system and its\nmediation of posture relative to gravity have the possibility\nof teaching the consciousness, and does the consciousness\nhave the property of amplifying or strengthening that media-\ntion?\nI assumed this reciprocity did exist. I decided that\nsensations are what we feel to be happening at the moment,\nand they can become images when we take notice that we are\nobserving them. This suggests that the consciousness can be\naware of itself-a defining characteristic—and that there is a\npositive use for this ability to split into self-regard. However,\nconsciousness doesn't work very well with the unknown, as\nwas revealed in the aikido roll. It seems to need to know or\nto be noticing in order to direct itself and the body. The\nattitude of \"witnessing\" may change this internal control\nissue. The search for internal sensations reveals that \"I can\nfeel the small movements.\" Then our attitude begins to shift\ntoward, \"The body is kept upright by constant reflexive\nmuscular actions around the skeleton.\" First we feel the\nmovements, then we can objectify the feelings into images.\nThe moment between these perceptions can be as short as a\nhyphen. All the above suggests that there is an important\ndifference between knowing-noticing and noticing-knowing.\n\nThese are the sorts of thoughts which came to mind\nduring the working period from January to June, 1972. Or to\nsay it in terms of the work: from Magnesium at Oberlin\nCollege through the spring term at Bennington College where\nwe further identified the premise, the phenomenon, to the\npresentation of the work in NYC I called *contact improvisa-\ntions.\" Students from those two institutions (plus members\nof the downtown dance community in NYC who \"sat in)\nwere joined by students from the classes of Mary Fulkerson\nat the U. of Rochester. The Rochester group was least\nfamiliar with the proposed movement, and as Fulkerson was\nteaching them Release Technique via intensive image work,\nit was in order to reach these students quickly that the\napproach outlined above was developed beyond what had\nbeen necessary at Bennington College.\nAt Bennington, I had begun by introducing these students\nof Western dance to Aikido techniques. However, I soon\nabandoned teaching Aikido and started work on specific tools\nfor the interior techniques. Although physical techniques\ncould be found for specific movement training, what those\nstudents required was a vision of Eastern martial arts philoso-\nphy underlying the techniques (or a viable replacement for\nthat). This laid the ground for introducing an improvisation\nwhich requires a state of personal involvement and physical\nresponsibility with/for another person.\nIt must be pointed out that many of the ideas about\nmoving which I used existed before this study. The teach-\nings of Release Technique, Aikido, and several other physical\nand mental disciplines were influential, and were adjusted\naccording to my understanding at the time in order to convey\nthe movement principles of the area of improvisation de-\nscribed by the words contact improvisation.\nBeyond that, to enable the movement to be accomplished\nsafely, came physical exercises designed to introduce sensa-\ntions that arise during \"flying,\" lifting, and being lifted, and\nto physically strengthen the body for these energetic extremes\nof the form. Physical strength was seen as the result of\nfinding the right, i.e., easiest, most efficient inner \"pathways.\"\nStress was discouraged.\nWe were starting to work on the technical method, a work\nwhich continues today, in an effort to describe what Contact\nImprovisation is on its own terms as a phenomenon of duet\nmovement as well as in the personal terms of a student, who\nmay for instance have physical strength but spatial weakness,\nor improvisational skills but does not trust their weight to\nanother person.\nTo summarize: images were used to focus the mind and\nthen give the mind foci within the sensations of the body.\nThe words had to be unambiguous, unthreatening, infor-\nmative and generally understood.\nThe statements had to be true, obvious, relevant.\nTo speak was also to set the tone. I tried to simplify the\nissues of the body for transmission to another body. I moved\nthe mind of my mouth into my body, located issues, and\nreported the issues speaking (I assumed) directly to another\nbody. The student's consciousness was enlisted to manage\nattitudes and observe the effect of image on the body, and to\nderive from these effects, and others observed within their\nbodies, images which could be named and otherwise objecti-\nfied and discussed, and fitted into the improvisational\nI made a number of assumptions. To study something\nlike improvisation, which is defined as you go, everything\nyou assume is going to affect the result. I tried to be aware\nof what the assumptions were and to let the phenomenon we\nexplored, the narrower field of improvisation when commu-\nnicating via touch with another person, guide the definitive\nimagery into appropriate areas.\nThis guidance caused us to consider all sorts of things,\nsuch as communication, emotion, psychology, sex, education,\nchildhood development, culture, taboos, space, time, and the\nself. It is al very well to say that one takes responsibility for\none's self in improvisation, but it is indeed a staggering job\nin its details. An improvisor's job is never done. Al this to\nexplore the ability of the consciousness to cleave to the\nbody's moment and remain there as the moment changes.\n\nfor John CAGE",

    "Content": "Collective research—we gath-\nered to ask and find questions. Ques-\ntions about form, performance, compo-\nsition, imagination, feelings/states,\nimprovisation, and dancing.\nNancy Stark Smith was the catalyst\nfor our group, bringing together Chris\nMathias, Ann Aronov, Ray Chung,\nKirk Andrews, Leigh Hollowell, Sha-\nron Tomsky, Martin Keogh, Julie Oak,\nRochus Schmucker, Ricardo Morri-\nson, Stefanos Georgantis and myself to\nspend a weekend intensively moving.\nspeaking, snoozing, feasting, and writ-\ning in a small town near the California\ncoast known as Point Reyes Station.\nThis was the home of Nancy's first\ncontact classes, and it intrigued me\nthat years later she had returned here\nto instigate a new kind of dialogue\nabout contact. So, as we considered\n\"the life cycle of a form,\" it conjured\nup images at many levels-form which\nlasts seconds or over the course of a\ndance, a dancer's life, the life of this\nform known as contact.\nIn a letter, Nancy had laid out\nsome seeds for the project:\n\"...wherelhow form originates,\nways to tap into the deepest physical\nresources of contact improvisation\nwhile playing with formal consider-\nations at the same time-being aware\nof the forms we're generating and\nactively working with them. I'd like to\ncommunicate through our dancing\nabout time, space, form, and feeling\nwith the same depth and integrity with\nwhich we listen to and move from\ntouch. weight, support and \"the\nforces'.\"\nOur stomping ground for the Pro-\nject was the Dance Palace, complete\nwith an old church space, large new\nstudio, and resident cow herd. The\npresence of our hoofed friends added \nso much visually, aurally, and at times\naromatically, that the bovine perspec-\ntive seemed to color our sensibilitics\nabout the whole weekend.\nWe arrived on Friday evening to\ndance, clarily what the research was\nabout, and develop structures for the\nentire weekend.\nThat evening. questions for the\ngroup were refined as:\na) Form and formlessness-the life\ncycle of a form-how form emerges;\nformlessness-the ground from which\nform arises?\nb) Intuition-the level of awareness\nfrom which choices are made; different\nlevels of relaxation and choices reflect-\ned in them. What one \"sees\"-intui-\ntive composition.\nc) What are we doing with our minds\nnow that (as experienced contacters)\nwe're not caught up in safety issues\nis our attention still on sensation?\nd) Playing with the score that Nancy\nhas been developing for about a year\nand a half\", that travels through a pro-\ngression of movement/mind states With\n\nan awareness of the arising, developing\nand resolving of forms. Letting this\nbe a ground for comparison to discov-\ner the truths that we each move from.\ne) Heart-it's role and the experience\nof it in dancing.\n1) The difference between doing, feel-\ning, and being.\nBathed in the silvery light of an\nApril full moon, we rolled over to the\nbunkhouse at the Point Reyes Youth\nHostel near Limantour Beach. After\nsettling in, the whole group broke out\nin a spontaneous discussion of dance,\nmetaphysics and linguistics that trailed\ninto the wee hours.\nSaturday we spent the morning in\nopen dancing and discussion. In the\nafternoon we worked with trios, cach\ngroup developing their own focus/\nstructure, and members of the group\nalternating roles as dancer and witness.\nWe then danced as trios for the entire\ngroup. That evening we prepared a\nlarge Passover Seder and performed\nour ritual feast back at the bunkhouse.\nSunday morning, we mapped and\nthen danced Nancy's score, and \"har-\nvested\" our experiences for a couple of\nhours. On Sunday afternoon, we all\ncreated an open space for dancing and\nwitnessing each other. The witnessing\ntook place at one end of the studio\nwhich lent a feeling of audience\" and\nheightened our awareness of formal \n\nvisual considerations as movers.\nWe chose to have three segments\nof dancing: the last focused on inter-\nacting with words, speaking both from\nthe perspectives of watching and/or\nmoving. It was fascinating to hear in\nthe moment what different audience\nmembers were attending to.\nThis process was extended to an\ninformal \"salon\" gathering on Tuesday\nevening in Ellen Webb's studio in\nOakland, where dancing and dialogue\ncontinued with movers and dance\nwriters from the Bay Area.\n\nHYPOTHESIS\nThe structure of the project had a\nspaciousness to encompass both our\ncommon questions and individual\ncuriosities; their coexistence was re-\nspectful, the tugs and interconnections\nbetween these layers so enriching.\nSome of our individual curiositics\nincluded: Articulating from a disori-\nented state to develop new ways of\nspeaking: Emotions as contradictions\nto the heart; Unity of focus— intuition\nas a bridge between the visual and\nkinesthetic; intuition in terms of vibra-\ntion, rhythm; What conditions make\nfor an ideal, sublime dance? Can we\ncreate them intentionally?; How struc-\nture offers a form so that one can go\ninto a state that makes you feel ready\nto interact in a more formless opportu-\nnity; Inner and outer—what's happen-\ning when you \"drop in?\"; Rhythms-\ninterpersonal differences and difficul-\nties arising from these; What attracts\nus at different times, what we draw\nupon or discard; Effort and non-cf-\nfort-the right amount to move you\ninto a new state, trusting the tension,\ngoing into the unknown; Recovering\nand expressing what you know; Grav-\nity as a curvature in space between\ntwo objects; Heart in the larger sense.\n\n//\nI felt a deliciousness in skill, control; an\nanimalness arising from this sense of\npower left me wide open, really soaking\nin sensation. \"I don't know.\" / thought\nso much, \"I don't know\"—in letting go of\nassumptions there was a cracking through\n(translating this to interrelationship), how\nmuch I can 'not know'—a sense of liberation\n\n//\nHighlights of the project for me included\nthe chance to work and play within a\ncommunity that I've danced with over the\nyears, but never as a group with a partic-\nular focus, other than a jam. No single\nparticular event occurred for me that /\ncould label as an epiphany, but the expe-\nrience of the project as a whole has\nstayed with me, and served as a catalyst\nthat continues to inspire, fuel and sustain\nmy further explorations in movement and\ncontact improvisation.\nI guess if I had to single out one\nthing it would be my experience of mov\ning together in a space with many people\nand really hearing, seeing. feeling, sens-\ning, that everyone was sensing me, and\nthat the communication was effortless and\ncreated a ground out of which anything\nwas possible.\n\nSharon:\nForm. Just a consciousness or intention\nseems to start it. Seeing a playful \"danc-\ning\" cow out the window. I didn't want\nto lose my group focus and get distracted.\nbut I was so captivated and delighted by\nthis cavorting bovine. A man was mow-\ning the lawn and the cow seemed to be\nplaying with that activity. Running away.\nwhen the lawn mower came close, move\nback closer to it, running away again. It\nwas so pure it made me laugh and feel\nhappy. Then the cow was joined gradual.\nly by a whole herd, who seemed to be\ndoing their own group score. This\ncaused me to move more energetically in\nthe room, playing with space and proxim-\nity to a few others.\n\nNSS said: \"Lightening up without\nlosing depth,\" \"Does the weight of your\nbody pressing into me leave a memory in\nmy cells?\" \"Assume connection!\"\n\n\nCHEWING THE CUD\nThese are reflections, insights and\npractices arising from the weekend\nwhich came to us: during the closing\ncirele, our Tuesday night talking/danc-\ning salon, and in the ensuing days and\nmonths since the project.\nChris:\nMobility is a key-not only movement, but\nenergetic and psychic mobility. How do\nI/we dip into that state (pool?) where the\npersonality, imbued with patterns and\nhabits, does not intervene in a heavy-\nhanded way but allows our dancing to\nunfold and express its true nature?\nRochus:\nIsn't it simply natural curiosiry that nat-\nrally makes us break habits?\nA n m ：\nNotes from Tuesday night: easy exchang-\nes, enterings and leavings. Noticing my\ngaze, feeling the eyes of the watchers,\nnoticing how that changes my eye focus;\nwhere I look as I am being looked at.\nRealization: This dance is happening at\nthis particular moment, on this particular\nevening, with these particular people,\nboth dancing and watching. Change any\nof those elements and it all changes.\nRay:\nThe residual fallout from the project has\nbeen the formation of one-day labs.\nEvery so often a group of us gathers to\nask questions and discuss what we're\ncurious abour and moveldance through\nand around these various issues. I espe-\ncially enjoyed the one where we danced\nwith outward visual focus and then with-\nout this focus. The change in spatial\nperception and interaction was amazing.\n\nS h a r o n :\nI waich a bee methodically and slowly\nclimbing up the window. I wonder why it\ndoesn't just fly to wherever it is going.\nMaybe it doesn't know where it's going.\nIs it thinking? Does it have any aware-\nness of following its \"inner mandala\"?\nDoes it have a plan? Ahh! It and a big\nmosquito hawk quickly descended to the\nwindow sill. A brief duet. Was it attrac-\ntion? Coincidence? Flirtation? Graz-\ning? Premeditated contact? The mosqui-\nto hawk stays on the window sill. The\nbee resumes a methodical and slow climb\nup the window. There wasn't much de-\nvelopment. Or resolution. Maybe they\nhave a history I don't know about.\nThe question-what conditions increase\nthe possibility of an epiphany, one that\nchanges you forever? These conditions\nmight help if the moon is right?\n• Having enough room\n• Dancing with someone you know\nvery well or someone you have just met\n• Dancing with a partner whose\npresence allows you to unravel your\nimpuise a fraction of a second longer\nbefore you need to save yourself?\n* A fluid sense of self\n_fil in the blank.\nJulie:\nI'm not sure I had any full-blown epiphs\nat the weekend but / definitely did have\none while \"chewing the cud\" in the fol-\nlowing days: For several of the gorgeous\nsunny San Francisco mornings which\nfollowed that weekend, I treated myself to\nsome movement time in Golden Gae\nWhile starting with Nancy's beau-\ntifully basic suggestion, lying on the floor\n(grass) and giving my weight over to\ngravity, I experienced a terrific feeling. /\nfelt as if gravity was pouring through me,\nlike it was a molten fluid force, and I was\na vessel through which it poured into the\nearth.

    "Content": "With the exception of one and a\nhalf years (during which I had fel-\nlowships to fund various writing\nprojects), I have spent the last fifteen\nyears of my life either studying or\nteaching in academic institutions. 1\nhave been involved with Contact\nImprovisation both inside and outside\nof these various institutions for\nwelve of those years. What follows\nare some thoughts about my experi-\nence teaching Contact Improvisation\nat Oberlin College which were occa-\nsioned by last semester's class, Aat\nHougée's essay, \"Paths of Change:\nnotes on contact improvisation in an\ninstitutional setting.\" (and Steve\nPaxton's response) in the Summer!\nFall '92 issue of Contact Quarterly,\nand a timely call from Nancy Stark\nSmith. [A.C.A.]\n\n\nI teach Contact Improvisation\nin the Theater and Dance program of\nOberlin College, a small liberal arts\ninstitution in the midwest. Walking\ninto Warner Center last spring to\nbegin the first class, I was over-\nwhelmed by a sense of the history of\nthis institution and Contact. Twenty\nyears ago in that very space, Steve\nPaxton came to give a movement\nworkshop, performed Magnesium,\nand met Nancy Stark Smith, then a\nstudent majoring in dance and cre-\native writing. Every time I teach this\ncourse I show my class videos of\nContact Improvisation, including the\n1972 tape of Magnesium, so that they\nbegin the course with a sense of the\nhistory of the dance form as well as\nOberlin's position within that history.\nUnfortunately, during the seventeen\nyears before I was hired, Contact was\ntaught only infrequently by visiting\ndance artists and interested students\n(who learned the form in workshops\nand then came back to \"pass it on\").\nI am the first person with a continu-\ning position (i.c., tenure-track facul-\nty) to offer Contact Improvisation as\na regular part of the dance curricu-\nlum. Contact Improvisation, at last\nfor the time being, has been \"institu-\ntionalized™ at Oberlin College.\nAllow me to immediately confront\nthe often negative connotations of\nthat term and assert that I'm not at\nall convinced (as Aat Hougée seems\nto be) that situating Contact within a\nschool curriculum is a negative thing.\nQuite the contrary. Rather than\nclosing down the improvisatory focus\nand anarchic quality of the dancing\nin order to institutionalize (in the\nsense of \"standardize\") the form, I\nbelieve that the liaison between Con-\ntact Improvisation and institutions.\nwhile potentially dangerous, can also\nchallenge the form of Contact Impro-\nvisation on one hand and extend the\npossibilities of teaching in an institu-\ntion of higher learning on the other.\nMy Contact class meets for two\nhours three times a week and we also\nhave a regular Sunday jam. The\nacademic semester lasts for an aver-\nage of four months. This gives the\nclass a wonderfully luxurious amount\nof time to work. During that time\nwe live intimately with the physical\nform and it is rewarding to see my\nstudents' bodies develop, and their\nminds begin to adapt to this close-\nness. I like to see how people's\nideas and relationships to the form\nevolve over four months; how they\ncontinually find ways to break\nthrough patterns which last week\nseemed so new and exhilarating, but\nwhich quickly become established as\nhabits. I am also interested in work-\ning through the initial amazement\nwith the dancing, past the inevitably\nfrustrating plateaus, and into new\nconnections with the form.\nThis kind of continuity differs radi-\ncally from the usual workshop format\nof much current Contact teaching.\nWhen I have participated in intensive\nworkshops like A Cappella Motion or\nretreats like the Breitenbush Jam, I\nhave often been struck by the surreal\nquality of the experience. People put\ntheir daily lives on hold to go off and\nhave a \"contact experience,\" often\nexpecting to have some sort of per-\nsonal revelation or dancing epiphany.\nThat kind of heavily charged emo-\ntional atmosphere can be exhilarating\nfor a while but seems hard to sustain\nand eventually becomes limiting.\nBecause a semester-length class\nforces us to work through this inten-\nsity and on and on, each person in\nthe class shifts through a variety of\nexpectations about what the form can\noffer them emotionally, physically,\nsocially, and institutionally. Our\ndiscussions at the end of every class\nmark these shifts of consciousness\nand it is exciting to see the class\nbecome aware of the different dimen-\nsions of their dancing engagements.\nIn addition, having a semester\ngives me a structure (yes-complete\nwith syllabus and grades) in which to\nask my students to learn about Con-\ntact Improvisation in a variety of\nways. Now that Cynthia Novack's\nbook Sharing the Dance is available\nin paperback, I have made it-as\nwell as selected issues of CQ-re-\nquired reading. Occasionally, we\nwatch videos which follow the evolu-\ntion of Contact and look at its impact\non other forms of contemporary\ndance performance and improvisa-\ntion. The students are also asked to\nkeep a journal of their thoughts and\nexperiences. Contrary to what one\nmight expect, I have found that this\nacademic frame does not take the\nspontaneity, physicality, or joy out of\nour dancing experiences. Under-\nstanding the form historically and\nintellectually can, in fact, deeply\nenrich the dancing. I believe that\nContact is a way of thinking as well\nas moving. Learning the skills and\nhaving the experience of improvising\non both these levels of consciousness\nis incredibly enriching and makes me\nmore and more curious about ways to\ncombine physical and mental danc-\nOberlin is a liberal arts college, not\na dance conservatory, and my stu-\ndents come into the class with won-\nderfully diverse sets of interests and\nbackgrounds. Biology students, jazz.\nmusicians, women's studies majors,\neven a philosopher or two, al take\nthe class, and this range of experienc-\nes is reflected in our discussions and\nin the student journals. Although\nthis means that I can rarely teach an\n\"advanced\" Contact class, it also\nmeans that my own ideas about Con-\ntact, my own belief about what Con-\ntact is, are constantly challenged by\nother people's perceptions and expec-\ntations.\nTeaching Contact in this setting\nforces me to address certain institu-\ntional issues such as power and di-\nversity. I like trying to develop new\nways to make Contact relevant in the\n1990s. For instance, I have begun to\nfacilitate workshops within Women's\nStudies conferences in which I use\nContact exercises to provide a physi-\ncal experience from which to talk\nabout the issues of location, margin-\nality, and centrality that are currently\nso problematic for feminist theory.\nRecently, I have also been playing\nwith the idea of setting up affinity or\ninterest groups within the class based\non a physical and intellectual explo-\nration of issues such as gender and\nsexuality, multiculturalism, body\nimage, etc. Every time I think to\nmyself that I am going too far, pull-\ning Contact Improvisation out of its\nappropriate context, I pick up an\nissue of Contact Quarterly and real-\nize that I am not alone; that other\npeople are also stretching the form,\npulling at its improvisational poten-\ntial to make it meaningful in other\nTeaching Contact in an academic\ninstitution has in no way co-opted the\nradical potential of the form. This is\nabsolutely clear to me each time we\ndance outside on a nice spring day\nand the Deans, Provosts, and assorted\nsuited administrators walk by as I am\nrolling on the grass with a student or\ntwo. As an improvisatory form in\nwhich relationships, movements, and\nsocial situations are all open to nego-\ntiation and invention, Contact refuses\nthe traditional student-teacher para-\ndigm and stretches the seams of the\ninstitutional context. I can't teach\nContact from behind a desk and I\ncan't keep an \"appropriate\" distance\nfrom my students. Even though I\nultimately guide them and grade\nthem in this course, that reality is\nusually suspended as we al lie down\nand sink our weight into the floor to\nbegin class.\nFrom the very first class, I try to\nopen a space in which the students\nare encouraged to move on their own\nand think for themselves. The class\nexercises don't ask that they follow\nme or try to look like me, but rather\nthat they feel their weight, the floor,\nand the contact point for themselves.\nIn the framework of an academic\ninstitution, this approach is disorient-\ning both for the students and for\nmyself. But this very willingness to\nbe disoriented is an integral part of\nthe training and a challenge of the\nform.\nTo teach Contact Improvisation in\nan academic institution is to engage\nwith one of the most radical forms of\npedagogy. Besides the open, dialogic\nclass dynamic, there is the whole\nissue of physical contact. Even the\nmost liberal-minded of my colleagues\ncan't believe I actually touch my\nstudents, let alone roll on the floor\nwith them. Understanding the differ-\nence helps me realize why I am so\ncommitted to this form of dancing.\nFor me, Contact Improvisation is not\njust another movement technique, it\ninforms my thinking, my teaching, as\nwell as my identity within the aca-\ndemic institution",

The author explores the contrast between continuous flow and the power of pauses, endings, and lingering within patterns. It also touches upon the need to embrace darker emotions and experiences in a time of hardship, suggesting that being open to inspiration is crucial.",
    "Content": "WHAT GOES UP\n\nDear Lisa,\nSunday night, Easter, 10:15 p.m.\nI started reading Movement Research’s\nlatest Performance Journal (#6),\nabout “heros and histories,” in which a\nlong list of authors/dancers write about\nsomeone or something that has influenced\nor inspired them. Got to thinking\nabout what inspiration feels like to me:\nhow it feels like spring, how it gives\nrise to action, and how it is contagious.\nI got more and more excited as I\ncontinued to flip through the journal,\nreading bits here and there, and I soon\nfound myself writing madly and noticing\nthat I was being inspired at even the\nthought of the others’ inspirations. I\nwas buzzing, my pen sailing across the\nlined white page, fighting the paper’s\nfriction, thumb and fingers squeezing\nhard to hang onto the pen as it flew\nacross the paper. Forearm tightening,\nneeding a breath, I felt myself finally let\ngo and slow down. Period. Pause.\nPeriod. Space. I’ve been obsessed\nof late with endings. With the period\nAnd the space after the period Watching\nfor the endings of things: Sentences.\nTrains of thought. Conversations.\nPhrases of movement. Phases of life.\nDances. The power of the end to lend\nshape, substance, and meaning to what\ncame before. And will come after.\nInspiration connected to expiration.\nBreathing in and breathing out\nIn Contact Improvisation, I learned\nthrough momentum how movement\ncontinues and can keep going almost\nindefinitely, as the senses do and energy\ndoes and one thing leads to the next,\nand there is always something going on,\neven in stillness there is something and\nonce one can “navigate through spherical\nspace” with relative abandon there\nare fewer and fewer safety reasons to\nbreak your flow. To stop moving. To\nstop.\nThe end of Contact Improvisation\ndances, especially in the frequently-used\nround-robin form, often comes only\nbecause someone else replaces you,\ntakes your partner, and you’re out. No\nperiod No space. Just an ongoing\nflow of activity. Momentum, both\nphysical and mental, has always inspired\nme, but now I’m stopping to look for\nthe definition of forms inside the flow.\nThe flip side of the momentum\nmode is another form I’ve experienced\nin Contact where, in an attempt to keep\nmyself and my partner ready for the\nunexpected, I learned to disengage from\nany beginning-to-be-predictable material.\nBut this way of resolving/ending/\nchanging elements within the dancing\nbecame just as predictable. Material\nstill never really resolved or ended, it\njust came to consciousness and was let\ngo of, leaving an “empty” moment in\nwhich the next sensation would arise\nand a new phrase begin.\nLately I’ve become curious about\nlingering in rather than disengaging\nfrom identifiable patterns that arise in\nmy improvised dancing, both alone and\nwith a partner, whether it is a particular\nquality of touch, an inner image, or the\nrhythm of a weight exchange, like the\nslow and granular shift of weight into a\nsupporting limb. Lingering seems to be\na way for me to follow a natural forming\nwithout arbitrarily staying with\nthings too long or dropping them prematurely.\nThroughout writing this, I’ve been\nhaving continual thoughts about our\nbeing in a time full of injury, illness,\ndisillusionment, fear, and rage. And\nscarcity. And how there’s a need, and\neven desire, to enter the shadow, to feel\nand move through the dark waters.\nMaybe this is the other side of the euphoric\nlove-and-light phase of the ’60s\nand ’70s that many of us were inspired\nby. We seem to need our other half.\nDark side of the moon. Which makes\ninspiration all the more penetrating.\nNot so much to be inspiring, but to be\ninspirable. To be ready and willing to\nbe moved\nLove,\nNancy",

    "Content": "A report on making a dance in Czechoslovakia \n\n\n\nIn the month of May, 1992, I\nmade a piece for A Dato Dance Group\nin Bratislava, Slovakia. I had met\nMarta Polakova, the leader of the small\ncompany, the previous summer in my\nclass at the Internationale Tanzwochen,\nVienna and she asked me if I would\nwant to come and make a piece with her\ngroup. I liked the idea, especially to\nwork with trained dancers, but I had\nlittle idea if such a project could be\nrealized.\nLater in the year, Josef Vlk, the\nleader of the theatre group of A Dato,\ncame to Amsterdam to fill me in on\ntheir progress. I learned that there\nwould be no money to speak of, but\nthere would be housing, enough allowance\nfor food, eager interest, and performance\nfacilities. Since I did not know\nthe dancers I suggested they send me a\nvideo of them improvising together.\nThis was a help. It it was not easy to\ndecide to go away as the season had\nalready been full for me. Finally, of\ncourse, I decided that to make new\nwork on these particular dancers, in\nSlovakia, would be a unique experience\nand a worthy challenge.\nOnce there, I found the working\nclimate to be vigorous, efficient and\nhealthy. Each morning, I would lead a\nwarm-up for the three women of the\ncompany, joined by former company\nmembers and other local dancers, in\ntotal about 6 people. After a short\nbreak, I would work with the three\nwomen, choreographing, rehearsing until\naround 4 pm, when they had to leave\nfor teaching jobs.\nThe idea of letting the body settle\ninto sensation and listen to what occurs\nwith a different awareness, ‘doing nothing’,\nwas rather a new experience for\nthese dancers. At first this could make\nthem giggly and distracted as though\nthey were ‘not working’. Improvisations\nwould be tackled with a vengeance\nand instructions filled in almost before\nthey were formulated. But in the course\nof a month, aided by their eagerness for\nlearning, new ideas began to take root.\nThis opened them to the value of taking\ntheir time and really seeing each other,\nrather than projecting themselves out to\nan imagined audience. These were\nexciting developments.\nThe dancers were very good at, and\n‘used to’, being shown movement and\nreproducing it, spending a good deal of\ntime on details. This stimulated me into\nmaking and teaching them more of my\nown movement, as it was emerging.\nThe piece, named Tangent, was made\nfrom selections of my phrases, solo\nphrases made by the dancers, group\ntasks and improvisations.\nMy original thought for the music\nhad been to mix the sound of the frogs’\nsinging near Devin Castle, where the\ndancers and I visited one Sunday afternoon,\nwith the voice of the castle guide\ntelling the visitors, in an on-going\nstream of Slovak, of the hundreds and\nthousands of years of peoples’ passing,\ncombatting and defending the place. I\nthought it would make an interesting\ncombination of sound materials for an\nedit; authentically ‘tangential’. But\nwhen Joself Vlk, the musical director of\nthe group, returned with a tape recorder,\nthe frogs were silent and the “guide”\nturned out to have been a knowledgeable\nstranger. Since the time was limited\nwe went back to our own resources\nand this worked out quite well. Josef\nmade the music on his synthesizer, live\nduring the performance, from samples\nthat we had selected and structured.\nIn classes and rehearsals I spoke\nEnglish, but only one of the dancers\nunderstood the gist of it, which made\ntranslation necessary, sometimes taking\na lot of time, for they are not used to\ntranslating for visitors.\nThe dancers took turns showing me\naround to the shops, post office, etc. but\nto find my way for buying food or\nclothing was still an interesting learning\nprocess. I became aware of how conditioned\nI am as a westerner, e.g. I would\ngo to a vegetable shop or supermarket\nall set up to buy some carrots, only to\nfind green peppers. Or I’d spot oranges\none day and go back the next day to\nfind only cabbage and potatoes. But I\nsoon learned that there is always something\nto eat and that you buy what there\nis or you eat nothing. Many articles\nlike coffee, shoes, etc., are often only\navailable on one day and not on the\nnext, which explains the long lines\naround the block on some days.\nWe worked in the studio Mondays\nthrough Saturdays and on Sunday we\nwould rest and need it! Or go out for a\ntrip, or a walk. One evening I saw the\nOpera in the National Theatre, conspicuously\nattended by many ‘rich’ Austrians\nfrom Vienna. In the same theatre I saw\na final performance of the Ballet Academy.\nBoth events were interesting\nenough but difficult for me to sit\nthrough. I enjoyed a performance of a\nSlovak Folkdance and Music Ensemble,\nin the more dreary outskirts of Bratislava.\nThis is obviously a popular entertainment,\nas well as a lucrative form of\ndance for young male and female dancers.\nThe A Dato dancers looked upon\nthis with sadness. They see the existence\nof many well-funded folkdance\ngroups as a major reason for the difficulty\nto keep men interested in the less\nremunerative field of ‘new dance’.\nOn the last three days of my stay,\nthe premiere performances of Tangent\nwere held in the Puppet Theatre of\nBratislava, a cute little stage just large\nenough. The costumes were designed\nand made at the last minute, with amazing\ncare and little costs. An excellent\nlight and sound crew, all in the family,\nset up the space in simple collaboration.\nThere was a lot of laughing and surprisingly\nlittle stress. On the same program,\nthe dancers performed a piece by\nMarta Polakova, Catch the Fall.\nIn the performance, the dancers\nmoved with abandon, now and then\nhurried, but also taking new decisions\nwhen possible! I was not unpleased,\nand the small audience seemed to be\nvery receptive. But it was strange for\nme to see the piece up on this little\nplatform stage. I felt that it would look\nbetter in a larger space, with the audience\nup higher than the dance floor.\nBut certainly in Slovakia the company\nwill have to take what is available.\nI was in the air back to Amsterdam\nduring their last performance in the\nPuppet Theatre. Tangent is now being\nperformed as part of A Dato’s 1992-\n1993 repertory. ★",

    "Abstract": "This article reflects on the 1992 PRO SERIES, a workshop program in Vienna designed for young professional dancers. It explores the cross-technical and aesthetic training methods of four invited artists from diverse backgrounds, aiming to record their unique teaching processes and classroom atmospheres. The program facilitated information exchange through co-teaching days and the work of a scribe, Christina Svane, who documented and provided feedback on the teachers' approaches.",
    "Content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe following writing is excerpted from the research\nmaterial generated by Christina Svane for the PRO SERIES\n'92. Applying the four lenses of: instruction, atmosphere,\nteaching, what is learned—technique, I culled these lines\nand paragraphs from Christina's forty-page portrait/report\nof the series.\nThe PRO SERIES is a workshop program in Vienna,\nAustria designed for young professional dancers. It was\nstarted by the Internationale Tanzwochen Wien [International\nDanceweeks Vienna] in 1990. In and behind this project\nare board members Suzanne Linke of Germany, Karine\nSaporta of France and myself, along with Ismael Ivo, artistic\ndirector, and Karl Regensburger, financial director of the\nTanzwochen.\nFor the 1992 PRO SERIES, we created a focus of research\nand exchange into cross-technical and -aesthetic training for\ndance. One of the main goals of the program was to record\nthe specific worlds, physical and mental processes, and\nclassroom atmospheres created by four invited artists from\nwidely varied backgrounds, as the beginning of an investigation\ninto the possibilities of information exchange. The\nhope is that by opening the doors into the houses that each\nartist has carefully created out of and for their dance discoveries\nand philosophies, we will begin to see these worlds\nmerge into a new technical understanding of dance.\nThe program's structure was set up to facilitate an information\nflow. Between each workshop, we scheduled coteaching\ndays which allowed the teachers and students to\nstudy in a completely different form We invited Christina\nSvane to act as a catalyst and scribe in the project, teaching\nher own writing process in each workshop, interviewing,\nrecording the teachers' work in the classroom, and giving\nfeedback. It was like having a microphone/video camera/mirror\nattached to your otherwise solo teaching existence.\nChristina's skilled and educated enthusiasm was the\nyeast in this bakery of mixed ingredients.\nI had no idea what to expect from the participants, especially\nthe teachers. I think they had no idea themselves\nwhat their response would be to this experiment. I was\ndeeply moved by the way each teacher and Christina joined\nthis cross-pollination process. They seemed to share with\nme a curiosity about what could happen to the body and\nthe art if the vocabularies, references, and specific worlds\nwere opened, letting fears and prejudices melt away in the\nwarmth of creative curiosity. They seemed to trust that\ntheir own creative path would be able to encompass the\nflood of new information. It was great to see the students\nfollow, sometimes with unbelieving eyes, as their teachers\nworked across their own borders into each other's dance\nworlds where there has been a great deal of prejudice in the\npast.\nI was also very pleased to see the response of the workshop\nparticipants, which at times threatened to get out of\nhand when their enthusiasm led them to ask for an entire\nre-scheduling of the program to enable them to take several\nworkshops at once. Learning is a wonderful hunger. I am\nsometimes shocked at how much of the time it is suppressed.\nWhat follows are four capsules of the teaching processes\nof artists Mark Tompkins (Paris), Saburo Teshigawara (Tokyo),\nYoshiko Chuma (New York), and Carlos Orta (Cara-\ncas/New York) and a poem It is interesting to me to see\nhow completely each teacher's world is created and how\nChristina captures the subtle process of their teaching. Her\nwriting seems to vibrate like a drumskin in many directions\nand many frequencies at once.\nIn these pages I see deep references to learning about\nthings that you find no education for elsewhere in our cultures.\nI see teaching processes that are empassioned with\nreal living interest. I see a spread of vastly different learning\natmospheres carefully and considerately constructed. I\nsee languages used to create freedom and intense self-reliance\nand creativity. I see processes being taught with assurance\nwhich show how to focus attention to a precision\nwithout leaving the motivation behind. I see ways in which\ndance has developed a whole system to sustain and develop\nthe individual and bring him/her fully and adventurously\ninto the human social network. I see an art form which has\nfound the keys to sustain exploration and discovery. I see\nart manifesting itself as a high social tool, an expression of\nits rightful power, coming from our bodies, minds, and\nspirits. This is for me the history of dance and the manifestation\nof excellence in its traditions, seen now in the 1990s.",

    "Content": "THE PRO SERIES 92 was a manifestation of a community\nof dance-makers. Community. Communicating. Manifesting.\nDancing. It functioned as a lens both inward and outward:\nmicroscope, telescope. What is the relationship of the\nindividual to his/her art? What is the relationship of this art\nto the world? Overview and interview. Discovering the\ncommon features of our work among dancers from all parts of\nthe world and all parts of the field. What \"cross-pollination\"\nmight occur by bringing together postmodern, modern, ballet,\ntheater, and spiritual dance traditions, represented in the\nbackgrounds of the participants and workshop leaders? To my\neyes as observer, participant, and writing leader, this crosspollination\nproduced new dimensions of reflection. Like adding\na few facets to a diamond. The diamond of awareness of\nour sources of inspiration. [C.S.]\n\n\ninstruction\nMark's voice is bare-bones, matter-of-fact as he instructs the\ndancers to manipulate the passive weight of their partner.\n\"Two things: Explore structure...warm up. It is not a massage.\nThe important thing is you don't have to be systematic.\nBut be curious. You can get involved visually, or\nthrough sensation, and you can get fascinated by a detail.\nYou can also explore what happens to your structure as you\naccommodate your curiosity.\"\natmosphere\nHe starts these instructions without any other preliminaries.\nNo greetings or gatherings. This creates immediately a\nsense of just do it, in the group. The room takes on the\nclear, dispassionate atmosphere of observation. The Laboratory.\nFacts of perception. His manner, like his voice, like\nhis body, emanates a tone of relaxed, almost blase cool.\nteaching approach\nMark demonstrates with his assistant, Willi Domer, each\ntime he gives a new instruction. These demonstrations are\ngenerous, long enough to let us see him dancing. He teaches\nwith his body, not his words. His body is not rushing\nthrough anything. It is not using shorthand. This anchors\nus in where we are. And empowers us to resist the temptation\nto abandon the steady focus we had built up—the\ntemptation to throw it away and go running after some\nexcitement. He and Willi hold the focus steady, like Sherlock\nHolmes and Dr. Watson holding a magnifying glass\nsteady over an important set of clues.\n\nAs people stream across the gymnasium floor, swiveling\nand reswiveling their heads to keep their gaze opposed, as\nhe asks, to their shifting path, he adds the idea of improvising\nwith the rhythmic independence of head from feet—not\nshifting always together. When that is achieved, he frees\ntheir feet from a steady pulse. Next to be taken away is a\nsteady direction across the floor. After that, one's weight is\nkept in a state of falling and the feet changing direction to\ncatch it. \"Ride your own personal roller coaster,\" he calls to\nthem.\nwhat is learned—technique\nHe is pulling the rug out from under them, over and over.\nHe is proving to them the independence of their parts, and\nthe mind of those parts. And that whatever is the constant\nfactor in what they are doing can become an inconstant\nfactor, and they can still ride. Their dancing is not dependent\non any constant factors.\n\nThis is the essence of the empowerment I saw coming from\nMark's work. The permission to acknowledge that maybe\nyou're interested in something else now. And that now is\nconstandy shifting. Working in this friendly fashion with\noneself—daring to take risks, but not denying where one's\nfocus is at any moment—makes one's energy and imagination\ncontinuously available for action. Out of which great\nart may arise, as a bonus. And in the meantime, the experiences\nare fascinating.\nWhat is remarkable in the teaching style he has developed,\nis how contiguous the bodies of material are, one thing\nflowing smoothly into the next. So that in the course of a\nsingle afternoon, a group warms up with technique, develops\nphysical improvisation skills, and is initiated into the\nperceptual maze of framing, composing and tracking one's\nfocus—skills which they soon have under their perceptual\nbelts.\nAt the showing finishing the PRO SERIES, the video tapes\nthat they produce from the class knock us all out, dazzled\nclarity of its intent.\n\n\nSABURO TESHIGAWARA\nDance of Air / Breaking Down Forms \n\n\ninstruction\n\n\"Our body, normally, is object. Objects are in time. But in\ndance, our body is in movement, and we try to think about\nquality. Quality is outside time. Rhythm is an object.\"\n\"How do we connect with others? I think about quality.\"\n\"They are breathing. That will be developed to feel\n'stream'. If I may say, if you have clear vision in and out,\nyou will get some stream. Inside of your body and outside\nof your body and on your skin.\"\n\nteaching approach\n\n\"I usually say, 'Don't think about figure'. And also, it's not\na result. They are checking their stream. They want to\nmake stream and feel it. And after, stream makes you\nmove. From inside and outside. So our class usually begins\nlike this\n\n\natmosphere\nThrough images of air streams, he leads them into states of\nclarity, surrender. With a single, occasional word, he guides\nthem to focus on the stream as line, or as seed. He suggests\nthe stream is now moving them from outside. He suggests\na meeting of the outer and inner stream.\n\"Usually I subtly suggest that stream will be line. What is\nline, that is the question.\"\nThe dancers immediately respond to this image (when it is\ngiven in class) with a heightened degree of directional\nclarity. The speed of the group's transformation is stunning\nand the audience is momentarily baffled, as if asking ourselves,\n\"Did I just see what I think I saw?\"\nThe authenticity of what we witnessed put to rest, at least\nfor me, any worries about the hypnogogic method he used.\nHe was using it to lead people beyond their limitations. He\nwas empowering them.\nLater, after another similar exercise, Saburo calls their names\none by one, and they stand up, fresh and smiling when then-\nname sounds. The demonstration is over.\n\n\nwhat is learned—technique\nWhat I see while observing this process—in which every\ndancer has left themselves behind and stepped into the\ndimension of an elemental quality—are acolytes, initiates in\na ceremony of empowerment. Because they are not working\non a style, they are gaining knowledge through direct experience\nof the natural world. With a few words he opens the\ndoor and invites them outside the world of constructed\nconcepts.\n\n\nCARLOS ORTA\n\nImagery and Vision\nThere is Carlos on a chair, his back to the mirror, near a\ngrand piano.\n\ninstruction\nSeveral dancers are working on their own. Intensely concentrating\non imaginary partners, they are embracing, struggling\nwith, lifting these partners, who turn out to be tuna\nfish (from Salvador Dali's \"Tuna Fishing\") they are killing.\nThere is an atmosphere of great dignity in the studio. A\ndance is being made here. We are in the temple of its inception.\n\natmosphere\nAs a teacher bringing with him his domain, Carlos has\nmoved in like a king with an invisible entourage. Weeks\nlater, in an interview, I discover who some of those invisibl\nfigures—advisors, emissaries, ambassadors from other\nworlds—are. From all of his words and gestures glows a\nlight of sacred tradition. Familiar and foreign. It offers\nreassurance, but also demands a sacrifice. It is an energy\nthat asks, \"Are you willing to go further?\"\nteaching approach\nWhen he listens he leans forward, investing his energy in\nthe speaker. He emanates his appreciation through his\nposture, charging the air and us with an elegant, relaxed\nintensity. Direct transmission. This is what is going on\nhere. Transmission of an attitude that dance is a noble\nquest.\nI watched amazed at their trust in his instructions. It is\nsomething I ask him about later: What empowers him to\nwin their trust on these journeys? I find out it is his own\nquest. These are not just words. They are experiences he\nhas had over and over. Technique.\nAll faces start shining as they do the exercise, empowering\ntheir hands. \"Now you could cure someone!\" he says at thf\nend. Believable, feelable, this awakening of energy.\nwhat is learned—technique\nEnergy. Where does it come from? When it fills us, where\ndoes it take us? I get the impression that for Carlos, this\nhas been a question—a quest—leading him through dance\nworlds in European capitals to a shaman's hut on the Amazon\nRiver to Hindu temples and Greek ruins. It is his devotion\nto that mystery that empowers him In every movement\nthe dancers make, he sees that mystery manifest. Or\nmuzzled.\n(He has just given two men in the group an instruction.)\nThe piano player is inspired and accompanies them, playing,\nas jazz critic Whitney Balliet once wrote, \"in the silver\nforest of the upper register.\" The music and Carlos's words\nhave a revelatory effect on the men, as they cross the vast\nspace, dancing—really dancing—for the first time. I am\nrelieved to notice that I am not the only person watching\nwho has tears in their eyes.\n\n\nYOSHIKO CHUMA\nShifting Concepts\nIt is the second day. She asks everyone to take the spot in\nthe room they had yesterday. \"It has become like your\nterritory.\" Once everyone is in place, ready to move, Yoshi-\nko begins teachings\ninstruction\nThroughout Yoshiko's classes: personal anecdotes and opinions\nare given equal value to her movement ideas. It seems\nlike a secret method of transmitting a particular kind of\nstrength. Maybe it's something she learned through hard\nknocks and she wants to save them the grief: personal\npower requires a personalized context. If you feel like an\noutsider, you can't be nourished by the field. Inside information—gossip,\nshop talk, stories full of famous dancers\nnourishes you like real grapes from a real grapevine. Yoshi-\nko always uses this kind of talk in her teaching, as if learning\nto sound like a choreographer is half the battle to becoming\na choreographer. And indeed it seems to function\nlike a puberty initiation, turning dance students into dancers,\nor dancers into 'performers'. It's a change in attitude.\nWas it Goethe who said you cannot help but be great, once\nyou feel at home?\nUp and down. Now she asks them to improvise between\nthe ups and down.\nShe claps her hands to start and stop the dancers—a stimulus\nlike a drumbeat, or a crack of a whip. \"If you are in\nbed, you'd never get up like that!

    "Abstract": "This article is an interview with Hillel Krauss, the originator of Martial Dance, a form synthesizing Contact Improvisation and martial arts. Krauss discusses the foundational principles of Martial Dance, including stillness, listening, and spontaneous action, emphasizing the importance of the initial meeting and interaction between partners. He explores how these principles are derived from both martial arts and Contact Improvisation practices.",
    "Content": "HILLEL KRAUSS is an improvisor,\nchoreographer, martial artist and\nthe originator of Martial Dance, a\nform he began in 1982 that synthesizes\nContact Improvisation and martial\narts. Hillel learned to play European-\nstyle soccer and began practicing Tai\nKwon Do Karate, both at an early\nage. He was first introduced to Contact\nImprovisation at Bennington College\nwhere he received a BA. in\ndance. In 1981 he co-founded\n“Waves,” the first Contact Improvisation\ncompany in Israel. Hillel has\nbeen practicing Tai Chi Chuan for 17\nyears which he teaches in Toronto,\nCanada. He is currently teaching\nworkshops and classes in Martial\nDance in the U.S., Canada, Israel and\nEurope.\nThis interview took place in August\n1992, after a ten year period of development\nof a form I have called Martial\nDance. Martial Dance is a study\nof the self and an exploration of relationship\nthrough a movement interaction.\nAs the form continues to evolve\nit reveals itself more and more to be\nabout the language of movement and\nthe ability to communicate clearly,\narticulately, and effectively in a movement\ninteraction. [H.K.]\n\nFoundation\n\nLisa Nelson: Hillel, what were the\nbeginnings of Martial Dance?\n\nHillel Krauss: Early on, when I was\ndeveloping the Martial Dance (MD), I\nwas intrigued by two questions—how\nto begin, and what is the nature of the\ninteraction? I struggled for years with\nwhat seemed to be something that\nshould have been right in front of me.\nWhat I came to understand was that\nrather than “how do you begin?” or\n“what is the meeting?,” what I was\nstruggling to articulate was the act\nitself—the coming together. I came to\nthis by trying all sorts of things.\n\nLisa: What were some of those\nthings?\nHillel: One exercise was two people\nrunning towards each other, head on,\nfrom one side of the room to the other,\nand then seeing what they would do\nwhen they met. But one of the main\nways we began was standing at arms-\nlength, facing each other. We’d come\nto a stillness and then listen for the\nmoment to begin and then we’d begin.\nWe’d usually begin by moving\ntowards each other.\nLisa: What led you to take this approach?\n4\nHillel: I took this from my studies in\nthe martial arts and the application of\nmartial principles and techniques to\nmy practice of Contact Improvisation.\nPart of the essence of all the martial\narts is that you bring yourself to a\nstillness. From there, one way to\nwork is to wait for the other person to\nmake a move, to initiate a motion or\nan action. You are watching for the\nmoment the thought appears and is\nfollowed through.\n\nThere is a saying in the martial\narts that the moment one person\nmoves it’s over. It’s pretty much\nfinished because you can either go\nright in on that person because you\nknow what they’re going to do, or you\ncan let the energy come towards you,\ndraw it in and then redirect it My\nunderstanding now is that it comes\ndown to how you hone your will and\nthe level of your concentration. I\ndeveloped this ability to concentrate,\nhave a single focus, and to be still,\nfrom my practice of both martial arts\nand Contact Improvisation.\n\nLisa: In an interaction of waiting for\nsomeone to make a move what initiates\nthe movement?\n\nHillel: Your action arises spontaneously\nfrom listening to what’s taking\nplace on an energetic level. In Martial\nDance we began by moving with parts\nof our partner’s body that we felt\ndrawn to.\nWhat I kept from this early work\nwere these fundamentals of being still,\nlistening, and being able to act spontaneously.\nAnother major part we kept was the coming together and how you\nknow where to go.\n\nLisa: How to continue?\n\nHillel: Yes. What is the first move?\nI was interested in this with Contact\nalso. When people go to do Contact\nthat first moment is always very interesting.\nPeople kind of saunter into the\nroom and begin to find a place to\ntouch, and it’s always different and\npeople do it in all sorts of ways, yet I\nalways felt that there was a certain\nsimilarity in the coming together. The\nfocus and attention to it was not very\nhoned.\nIn the MD, that initial focus is\nvery important, as is the coming together\nin a martial interaction. The\nway I do it is I listen for where the\nenergy is—I listen to what the physical\nmotion is on the surface of the\nperson and also to where the person is\nlocated internally—where the energy\nwithin them is in motion and where it\nis not in motion. When it’s not in\nmotion, if it’s not a cultivated stillness,\n(a conscious stillness centered in a\nparticular place in the body), it’s going\nto be a blockage, a holding of energy.\n\nLisa: Do you make a distinction\nbetween a holding that you call a\nblock and a holding that’s functioning\nto support the part that’s moving?\nHillel: Yes, of course, and much of\nthe dance is to free these holding\npatterns so that they become supportive\nof, rather than blocking, the movement.\nIn MD, motion is supported by\nthe place where the energy is still.\nBut to say that the energy is still is not\nreally what is happening. The energy\nis never still. It’s actually in motion.\nIt’s just more collected. A collected\nand coming-back-on-itself motion,\ncircular regeneration. In Tai Chi, the\ncenter is described as a sphere, a ball\nthat is constantly turning, and that\nturning is generating Chi. That is the\nstillness I’m talking about. A very\nalive stillness. One of the main focuses\nof Martial Dance is the cultivation\nof the lower center as used in the\nmartial arts and how to direct our\ninternal energies from this center.\nI’ve danced with people who don’t\nwork with their lower center primarily.\nInstead they work with a constantly\nshifting center in their bodies. I do\nthis myself, especially in Contact, but\nalso in MD. This is a very different\nidea than in the martial arts where\nyou’re always moving and projecting\nfrom a specified center.\n\nLisa: I would say that Contact Improvisation,\nas a proposal from the beginning,\nseemed to be set up to explore a\nmoving center. Rather than locating\nyour center in a certain part of your\nbody, it gave you a practice of watching\nthe constant shifts of balance\ntaking place within you. And it never\nincluded “power” as an image to\ncultivate. That seems a fundamental\ndifference between a martial art and\nContact Improvisation.\nHillel: I think Contact was not concerned\nwith generating a force or a\npower to travel along a defined line\ninto another body. To do that effectively\nyou need to be organized in\nrelation to the lower center in the\nbody.\nMartial Dance incorporates the use\nof a constantly shifting center and also\ncultivates the lower constant center as\na source of movement. My initial\ndesire in doing MD was to understand\nhow to interact with any type of\nmovement energy, and this synthesis\ngave me that ability.\nMy understanding of Contact Improvisation\nwas that it was a form for\nmoving with another person working\nin gravity, which meant you could go\nanywhere with it. What drew me to\ndevelop MD was that I began to see\nthat there were certain movements that\npeople who do Contact didn’t know\nhow to interact with.\nLisa: In the sense that they would get\ninjured? Or that they chose not to\ninteract with it?\n\nHillel: It was outside the context of\nan unwritten understanding in Contact\nof “how we’re going to move together.”\nIn Contact, if a person shifts their\nweight onto one leg and they lean on\nme with their center up by their shoulder,\nthey create a ‘trim-tab effect’, or\nfulcrum, in the body at their shoulder.\nYou can touch the body at a fulcrum\nand the whole body moves very easily.\nIn martial arts, you work with\nthese same principles, except your\nintention is different. While doing\nContact, I would begin to interject\nmore martial-oriented intentions while\nmoving, such as a ‘take-down’, a\nthrow, a push or a pull. In the beginning\nI found that to take the action in\nthis direction was unfamiliar to people\nwho were doing Contact. Mostly, I\nthink that people who did Contact\ndidn’t have a martial mind or awareness.\n\nLisa: Or a desire?\n\nHillel: Yes, or a desire. I had this\ndesire because I was also a martial\nartist. At the same time I felt that in\nlife there are many experiences where\nyou are being thrown. There are many\ninteractions where a person comes to\nyou and they’re not interested in flow,\nthey’re not interested in moving harmoniously\nwith you. There are also so\nmany things taking place in an interaction\nwith another person—how do you\nknow how to move with the interaction?\nI found that the skills that I\nlearned from Contact didn’t empower\nme to interact with all types of people.\nI was always curious about a head-on\ninteraction, of meeting something\nsquarely and then seeing where you\nmove with that\n\nLisa: What other studies were valuable\nin your development of MD?\n\nHillel: I was always interested in\ninteractive dance. I was very interested\nin dancing with the projection of\nmy partner’s energy and movement in\nspace. Later, when I did Contact\nImprovisation, it felt very akin to this\nway I was working. It was like bringing\nwhat I was doing from a distance\nright to the body.\n\nOne of my teachers who I was\nvery influenced by in regards to interactive\nmovement from a martial perspective\nwas Milford Graves. I studied\nwith him over the course of a few\nyears at his center in NYC. The sessions\nusually lasted about three hours.\nHe went from teaching African dance\nto working with principles from Tai\nChi ‘push hands’ and Kung Fu ‘sticky\nhands’. Once I had accomplished that\nand had gotten strong, we started\ndoing harder styles that involved a lot\nof kicking and punching and elements\nof western boxing. We would work\nout and spar constantly, with gloves.\nI learned many things from Milford,\none of them being an understanding\nof the connection between dance\nand the martial arts. He talked to me\nabout how much of western dance is\nfeminine by nature, and that most of\nthe dance I had trained in was feminine\nmovement, and that I should learn\nmasculine motion. He said that in\nAfrican dancing the men do dances\nthat are actually preparation for battle.\nHe showed me certain movements and\nhe said, “Now you take this movement\nand put a spear in the hand and you’ll\nunderstand the movement,” and it was\nlike a flash of lightning. My training\nwith Milford Graves was a very intensive\none.\nMy senior year at Bennington\nCollege I taught a class and called it\nMartial Dance. At that time I incorporated\nmany of the movements I\nlearned from Milford which were\nAfrican in origin, martial movements\nwhich involved a tremendous use of\nthe pelvis and hips.\n\nLisa: Do you still include some of\nthat material when you’re training\npeople in MD?\n\nHillel: No.\nLisa: What happened to those movements?\nHillel: I integrated them. For me it\nwas more a vehicle to understand\ncertain elements of motion, rhythm,\nand the power generated from the\npelvis. My training and practice from\nearly on was in both dance and martial\narts. But I was more interested in\nContact Improvisation at this time. I\nbegan to see the beauty of Contact and\nwent to master it very consciously—an\napproach that comes from my martial\nbackground.\nLisa: What skills did you find in\nContact to be mastered?\nHillel: For me they were really basic.\nThe give and take of weight; moving\nwith a point of contact, or, I like to\nsay the area of contact; the idea of\nfollowing; and, of course, surrendering\nto gravity and falling. All of those\nskills became part of MD.\nLisa: What skills from the martial\narts did you blend into those Contact\nskills?\nHillel: In the earlier years of doing\nContact there was less focus on the\nhands and more on the body. From\nthe martial arts, I began to incorporate\nthe use of the arms and hands to move\nmy partner. I saw that I had arms so\nwhy not use them?\nLisa: Is it a volitional use of the arms\nrather than a supporting use of your\narms?\nHillel: It’s both. I always felt that\nthere was no separation between information.\nSo I was able to translate all\nmy information and kinesthetic understanding\nfrom my martial training into\nmy Contact practice and vice versa.\nThe skills I remember learning the\nmost from Contact were listening and\nthe ability to follow. Listening and\nfollowing are also two of the main\naspects of Tai Chi. Tai Chi is based\non yielding, unlike other martial arts\nwhich are more offensive in nature.\nTai Chi has offensive elements, but it\nis based on the understanding of being\nable to yield, where the weak can\novercome the strong, the soft can\novercome the hard. In relation to\nleading, I realized that if I didn’t master\nfollowing, I couldn’t lead effectively-\nFollowing became a key focus in\nMD. In Tai Chi, you’re always looking\nfor when the other person is off\ncenter, or how to bring them off center.\nThen you can take advantage of\nthat momentum by adding your own\nenergy to move them where you want\nthem to go.\nIn Contact Improvisation you interact\nin a way that a martial artist never\nwould interact. For example, you are\nmaking contact with all parts of the\nbody. You’re turning your back to\neach other, where you have no focus\non defence. You’re allowing yourself\nto be completely vulnerable. You’re\nmoving your center to different parts\nof the the body. You’re letting your\nweight pour into another person and\ngiving yourself away. You’re constantly\npassing through your center\nline like a pendulum.\nTo apply martial movement and\nprinciples to this expanded set of possibilities\nallows for a fuller range of\nmotion and interaction than is commonly\nfound in the martial arts. It\ngoes beyond the primary modes of\nattack and defence to include also\nsupport and surrender. This also expands\nthe interactive possibilities of Cl\nto include the use of volitional force to\nbring someone else to movement. So\nyou how to respond in any given situation.\nFour Modes of Interaction\nHillel: In the beginning, people started\nto call what I was doing “combat\ncontact.” At that time there was very\nlittle real blending of the two forms,\nthe Contact and the martial. I later\ntried to blend things by working with\nfour modes of motion: attack and\ndefend, which is from martial arts,\nsupport and surrender, which is from\nContact. I also worked with manipulation\nphysically and energetically. I\nwas interested in mixing these pieces\nso that you could respond to an approach\nin a way that you wouldn’t\nnormally respond. For example, you\nwouldn’t normally respond to an attack\nwith a support. You would most\nlikely defend in some fashion, which\nincludes “neutralizing.” But you can\nrespond to an attack with a support.\nOr vice versa.\n\nLisa: That’s interesting. Bonnie\nBainbridge Cohen uses the terms\n“bonding” and “defending” as two\npoles of an interaction.\n\nHillel: Yes, that’s beautiful, I think of\nit as bonding, when I attack I’m bonding\nwith my partner’s energy. I’m\nmeeting it, engaging it, and creating a\nparticular effect with that energy. It’s\na very Aikido understanding—bonding—because\nin Aikido there is no\nopponent, you’re harmonizing with the\nKi of the person you’re moving with.\nLisa: Attack and support are easier\nfor me to build a physical image of.\nSurrender doesn’t have as clear a\nphysical image for me.\nHillel: Because surrender as a concept\nis the most difficult to understand\nand to do, it is also the most difficult\nto image physically, as opposed to\nattack/defend/support. It involves an\nimage of “letting go,” no longer controlling,\nalmost a trusting that you will\nbe caught. There is also an image of\nsurrender as in “serving” in a higher\nsense. Following can also be an image\nfor surrender. In MD, surrender\nusually comes first in response to a\nsupport, but it can also be a response\nto an attack.\n\nLisa: And “yielding”?\n\nHillel: Yielding, in MD, is under the\ncategory of defence. It is a Tai Chi\nterm, you “yield” to an attack. Yielding\nis really the same thing as creating\nspace, making room. So when you\nyield usually what you are doing is\nwithdrawing, drawing a circle around.\nWhen you yield and withdraw, it is\nalso a drawing with. First you create\nspace by withdrawing, then there is\nsuddenly an opening and your partner\nis drawn in and they cross their center\nline.\nOne of the main focuses in MD is\nthis opening, this space. We dance\nwith an awareness of it. It is mainly\nfrom here that we move our partner\nand are moved. In Tai Chi this awareness\nis also used.\nLisa: And then surrender may be...?\n\nHillel: Surrender works in a number\nof ways. It works internally as a state,\nas an action of the self. One way it\ntranslates into movement is when\nyou’re allowing your center to be\ntaken and moved. For example, you\ncan surrender to a throw. In the martial\narts there is rarely an aspect of\nsurrender in movement, two exceptions\nbeing in the practice of Aikido and Tai\nChi. The way Ueshiba set up Aikido,\nyou have uke and nage, and uke surrenders\nand allows himself to be\nmoved. That’s the training and it’s\nnot an actual combat situation. In\nMD, as in Aikido, you’re actually\ntraining to be moved and you practice\nbeing in your center when you’re\nmoved.\n\nLisa: The martial aspect of Martial\nDance is becoming clear to me and its\ndifference in intention from Contact\nImprovisation. Can you talk about\nwhat the full intention of Martial\nDance is? What are your practicing?\nHillel: It has to do with two things\nthat are a progression. The first is a\nmoving towards and the second has to\ndo with consciousness. The dance\nbecomes about where one is conscious\nand where one is unconscious in relationship\nand in the action of the body.\nIt’s very much a physical, emotional,\nmental and spiritual experience.\nAwareness of the body/self is\npracticed through the purely physi-\ncal/movement-oriented part of the\nform. When people begin to learn\nMD, they have a natural element of\nsurrender. Even if it manifests as\nresisting, they’re already surrendering\non the level of taking a step towards\nbeing moved by coming to meet me.\nIn MD, the interaction is about\ncoming towards each other, engaging,\nand what happens in the meeting.\nEven if the movement interaction is a\nmoving away it’s still an inner action\ntowards. The same way as I’ve said\nthat an attack can be support. In any\nmartial interaction, two people are\nmoving towards each other and are\ncommitted to that. The nature of the\ncoming together is somewhat different\nin MD. In a martial art they’re coming\nto overpower and win. In MD,\neven though you can overpower another\nor allow yourself to be overpowered,\nit is only one part of the dance.\nThe possible directions and dimensions\nof the interaction are more varied.\nThe Will and the Center\nLisa: Can you talk about the use of\nthe will in Martial Dance?\nHillel: The use of the will in MD is\nalmost identical to its use in the martial\narts in terms of understanding\nwhat an action is and the purpose of\nan action. The will is simply how you\nbring yourself to the interaction, how\nyou focus the power of the self.\nI experience MD as an exercise of\nmy will. By will, here, I mean that\nwhich is faster and higher than\nthought, it precedes thought.\nLisa: / might call that “desire.”\nHillel: The reason I don’t call it\ndesire is because I attach desire to the\nsenses and I attach will to something\nprevious and above the senses, to the\nlife force that animates us. Although\nthey both act through the senses because\nwe’re in form.\n\nLisa: How does that relate to\nmoving?\n\nHillel: The action of the will is what\nmoves a person. When you engage\nyour will fully it’s the most direct\naction you can have with another\nperson or with life. Much of the\ntraining in MD is actually to cultivate\nthe ability to arouse and use your will.\nWhat that action gives you is a taste\nof being yourself with another person.\n\nLisa: What a luxury.\n\nHillel: It is not a luxury, it is a\nchoice. I have a good friend and\nteacher, Meir Abehsera, who speaks\nabout making a demonstration of life\nfor a person who is depressed or really\nstuck. When you engage a person in\nthe way I’ve been describing, they feel\nit It awakens their memory. The\nperson begins to remember many\nthings, they remember their selves,\nthey remember where they come from.\nI don’t mean memory like what you\ndid yesterday or the day before, I\nmean the memory of the self. It can\nbe related to the memory of your life,\nthe path your life has taken, where you\nstarted and where you’re at now,\nwhere you’re going, or beyond that to\nthe memory of where your soul is\nsourced from. This relates in movement\nto the past of the action, the\npresent of the action, and the future of\nthe action. Or more simply put, where\nthe movement is coming from, where\nit is now, and the trajectory of where\nit is going to.\nWhen a person experiences memory\nit is one of the deepest, most beautiful\nexperiences, because in that moment\nthere is knowing. I use the\nwords “memory” and “home” interchangeably.\nMany people forget what\nhome is, and if you remind them on a\nbasic level they return with a homing\ninstinct like a bird that flies back to its\nnest.\n\nLisa: If you’re committed to working\non becoming aware, any kind of meditation\npractice might bring you to\nthose places.\n\nHillel: Yes, in a way you could say\nthis about every higher discipline. But\nat the same time, MD, as a practice\nand discipline, is focused on relationship.\nIt’s the experience of these\nthings in relationship with another\nperson while in movement.\nAnother major component of MD,\nthe same as in Aikido and Tai Chi, is\nunderstanding your center and your\nbalance. One way to break a person’s\nmasks, or defences, is by taking their\ncenter and balance away.\nThere is a place within an inch or\ntwo off the central equilibrium line,\nworking within a cone structure with\nits base by the feet and its opening by\nthe head, that I describe as the point of\nweightlessness. In MD we cultivate\nthe awareness of this balance/off-bal-\nance point, and we move and are\nmoved to this place and beyond. In\nthe beginning, this experience leaves a\nperson in unfamiliar territory and they\nhave an immediate response. Either\nthey’ll let go or they’ll resist. MD is\ndone in the context of constant and\ncontinuous support so that when the\nperson experiences something being\nbroken, or “shattering,” as I like to\ndescribe it, it happens in a context of\nsupport.\nLisa: What follows the experience of\nshattering?\nHillel: What happens next is that they\nfeel the support. Usually what they\nfeel is two things, first they feel themselves\nmoving freely, free of that\nwhich they were holding. The next\nthing they experience is being loved.\nThis allows a person to be more present.\nMaintaining a constant presence\nand awareness is a fundamental part of\none’s practice and development in\nMD.\nThe Physical Practice\nLisa: Can you give an example of\nhow you develop the physical work?\nHillel: I work in different ways.\nTaking from the martial arts, I work\nwith the tan-tien, a Chinese term for\nthe lower center in the body. It is a\ncenter that is cultivated to build energy.\nThere is the understanding that\nyou can collect energy, build it, and\napply it. In more traditional dance,\nlike ballet and most forms of modem,\nthey usually move from a center that\nis higher up in the body. The problem\nwith that, in a MD application, is that\nyou can’t generate the same kind of\npower if the center is higher in the\nbody.\nIf a person isn’t moving from their\nlower center, I dance with them wherever\nthey are. I organize my whole\nbody from that point of contact, to\nmake the most direct line through their\nbody into their lower center.\nOften in working with people in\nthat way other parts of their bodies\nwill collapse. One of the techniques I\nthen began to work with was applying\npressure on both ends of the bone, so\nthat a person would get the idea, “hey,\nthere’s a line from one side to the\nother and that line is very strong.”\nThen I would line up and apply pressure\nfrom their hand through their\nwrist through the elbow through the\nshoulder. Eventually, when that was\norganized, I would line it up through\nthe shoulder down through the spine to\nthe center. Then, when I moved with\nthem along those lines, they would\nstart to feel themselves in their center.\nI would be talking to that place\nthrough the movement. I began to call\nthis technique shaping.\nLisa: It sounds like you’re practicing\na kind of hands-on repatterning work\nin the dance. Do you teach students\nto do that for each other?\nHillel: Yes. As students investigate\nthe effect of their actions on each\nother, it is an immediate feedback\nsituation of what works and what\ndoesn’t and how it feels. I guide this\ninvestigation with movement from Tai\nChi Chuan and from what has arisen\nfrom the practice of MD itself.\nI am also utilitizing work from\nMoshe Feldenkrais, especially from his\nearly period which was more martial-\noriented. This hands-on manipulation\nbecame part of MD, going hand in\nhand with the non-manipulative aspects\nof Contact Improvisation.\nUsing this shaping technique organizes\none to understand the lines of\nmotion in the body related to the center.\nThis organization enables one to\ngenerate a force that can move through\nthe body most effectively. I talk about\nthis as creating a unified focus. Once\nthis skill is learned you begin to understand\nwhere you can go with it, the\nlines you can move on. These are\ntrajectories that extend beyond the\nbody that are based on lines that we\nwork with within the body. These\nlines are structurally and energetically\noriented.\nWhen I’m teaching I’ll take a\nstudent off center. From there they\ncan experience the shape of their body\nand the lines of motion along which\nthey can be moved. They can anticipate\nall of the possible directions it\nmight go and be able to go there safely.\nThis is a similar way that they\nwork in Aikido.\nLisa: Can you talk more about your\nwork with Moshe Feldenkrais?\nHillel: Moshe Feldenkrais pointed out\nthat one movement in the human that\nis superior to the movements that\nanimals have is our ability to turn\naround ourselves, to swivel and pivot\nat great speeds with almost no effort.\nIn MD and the martial arts, the power\ngenerated from the pelvis and hips and\nthis turning Moshe talks about is used\nconstantly.\nWhat I gleaned from Moshe’s\nwork was a way to organize the body\nto move effortlessly. This effortlessness\ncomes from the ability to organize\nyourself in a way that you can\ngenerate a force through the skeleton.\nIt’s not a matter of muscular strength,\nit’s the organization of one’s entire\nsystem— nervous, skeletal, and muscular—for\none clear act.\nI then incorporated this understanding\ninto moving with a partner, where\nthey could feel and become aware of\ninefficiency and efforting in the dance,\nand move with me or another to improve\ntheir ability to organize efficiently.\nOnce you have these experiences\nfrom the Feldenkrais method you\nnever lose them. They stick with you\nas a constant reminder. I learned this\nMovement lessons which are structured\nto open up new movement configurations.\nI have found no other\nmethod that offers this the way\nMoshe’s work does.\nWhen you begin to organize your\nbody in a more efficient way and\nmove with a partner in this way, you\nare only expending energy when you\nneed to. Of course you have different\nways of moving with different gradations\nof energy that can change at any\nmoment. From something slow to\nsomething fast. From something soft\nor hard to a tremendous wave of energy\nthat moves through the body into\nanother person.\nMost often when people learn new\nmovement they hold their breath.\nWhen you move in the way I’m describing,\nyou never hold your breath.\nThe breath can be very conscious, as it\nis in Tai Chi, where it’s slow, even,\nand deep.\n\nLisa: Is there any more to say about\nMoshe’s work and how it influenced\nyou?\nHillel: Many times when dancing\nwith someone, I feel that they have\nvery few options in their response. I\nmove with them in a way that shows\nthem that they have more than one\noption of how to move and organize\nthemselves in any given situation.\nMoshe spoke about how you should be\nable to move at any point in time in\nany direction without preliminary\npreparation. This is a very martial\nawareness.\nLisa: Is there any aspect of MD that\nyou think of as performance-oriented,\nor is it purely a practice like a martial\nart or social dance form?\nHillel: I see it as a practice and also\nas a performance art. I can describe\nsome of my images of performance.\nOne image I have, and am attempting\nto do in Israel now, is to have twenty\nor more people doing MD in a large\nspace or gymnasium. It reminds me\nvery much of what was done in the\npast in different martial schools in\nEurope with fencing and in the East\nwhere many people would be practicing\nsimultaneously in a martial hall.\nThe type of focus that people have\nbegins to resonate, and you can begin\nto see the energies moving.\nI also see performing MD where\npeople can have an experience watching\nthe inner workings of an interaction.\nTwo possible ways this can be\ndemonstrated are: One, where you\nhave two people who are both adept at\nthe form and can really move with it\nThe other is where one person is adept\nand the other a beginner. There’s a\ntremendous beauty that comes from\nthis interaction. The beginner is discovering,\nlearning, and doing in unpredictable\nways. Also the emerging of\nthe self is more tangibly visible. You\ncan see the meeting and the disappearing.\nMy feeling is to continue to perform\nwith dancers who have the ability\nto be vulnerable in front of people,\nwhere they’re actually learning and\npatterns are being broken and new\nones created right in front of your eyes\nand all the emotions are in motion.\nThe depth of what it means to have a\ncommitment to moving towards each\nother can be seen and witnessed. I\nfirst performed MD in this kind of\nlesson-form in New York City in 1983\nwith Simone Forti.\nFor me, performance was sitting\nand watching a lesson given by Moshe\nFeldenkrais. It changes the idea of\nwhat performance is.",

    "Content": "Introduction\nThere is a fascinating relationship\nbetween the evolution of structure in\nimprovisation and the scientific principles\nof systems theory, colloquially\ncalled chaos theory. In Order out of\nChaos, by Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle\nStengers, they describe and analyze\nmany self-organization processes in\ninorganic and organic systems of\nnature. By examining these processes,\nthey develop concepts that explain how\norder is created out of chaos and argue\nthat it is a fundamental process in\nnature. As improvisations evolve\nthrough self-organization processes,\nthey can be described using terms from\nchaos theory such as dissipative structures,\nbifurcation points, attractors, and\nfields.\nIn his article, \"Dance Improvisation:\nCreating Chaos,\" printed in the last\nissue of CQ, Kent De Spain describes\nhow chaos can be used to explain how\nseemingly random processes in improvisation\nactually contain complex, innate\nstructures. He defines and explains\nchaos, strange attractors, and\nfractals and their relationship to improvisation.\nI would like to continue the\ndialogue between chaos and improvisa- tion\nhow the self-organization process\noccurs in several improvisational structures\nthat I have experienced and/or\ncreated.\nOrder in improvisation often appears\nchaotic, but when looked at more\nclosely, it has an underlying dynamic,\nenfolded structure. Self-perpetuating\nforms are often embodied in solo, duet,\nor group improvised dancing. I have\nseen such structures arise organically in\nworkshops that I have led and participated\nin at improvisational jams and\ncollectives, and also in improvised and\nloosely composed performances.\nAs animals, we self-organize because\nof instinctual patterns. However,\nwe are also conscious, self-aware, and\nself-reflective beings and these qualities\nadd complexity and the unknown to\nself-organization as it occurs in improvisation.\nThe task of an improvisor is to\nreach a singular point where she can\nalign with, and consciously go beyond,\nhabitual patterns. Following the flow\nof events in an improvisation, she can\nrespond to and integrate the fluctuations\nthat occur in this open system.\nWith consciousness comes the responsibility \nto make choices about how, in\nwhich direction, and in what context\nthe flow of interactions will evolve. At\nevery moment, with each fluctuation\nand nuance, there is the potential for\nnew directions in an improvisation.\nATTRACTORS\nAn innate tendency in nature, embodied\nin improvisation, creates structure\nfrom random behavior. This tendency\nto create structure takes place\nwithin fields made up of various attractors.\n\"An attractor is a region of phase\nspace which exerts a 'magnetic' appeal\nfor a system, seemingly pulling the\nsystem toward it.\"1 For example, if\nmarbles are rolled into a shallow, wide\nbowl, they roll in various paths, dependent\non the force and angle at which\nthey are tossed. However, they will\nalways end up at the bottom of the\nbowl unless they are thrown so hard\nthat they end up out of the bowl. Due\nto the effect of Earth's gravity, the\nbottom of the bowl becomes an attractor.\nEarth's gravity affects everything in\nits field: objects thrown into the air will\nfall back to the Earth unless there is so\nmuch thrust, as in space missiles, that\nthey end up outside Earth's gravitational\nfield. Because of the influence of\nvery powerful attractors like gravity,\nmagnetic fields, and large bowls, certain\nbehavior patterns can be predicted.\n\nDISSIPATIVE STRUCTURES\n\"We now know that far from\nequilibrium, new types of structures\nmay originate spontaneously.\nIn far-from-equilibrium conditions,\nwe may have transformation\nfrom disorder, from thermal chaos,\ninto order... We have called these\nnew structures dissipative structures\nto emphasize the constructive\nrole of dissipative processes in their\nformation.\"2\nA dissipative structure is the selforganization\nprocess that occurs when\na system is disordered and far from\nequilibrium. Dissipative structures can\nbe created through improvisation, and\nare influenced by attractors that are a\ncombination of consciously set parameters\nand innate behavior patterns. To\nillustrate the self-organization process\nin improvisation, I will be describing\nsome specific scores drawn from the\ndisciplines with which I have experience—contact\nimprovisation, theater\ngames, and movement improvisation.\nThere are two generic self-organization\nprocesses. One type begins with a\nrandom structure and, by using catalysts,\ncreates order out of chaotic conditions.\nThe other type begins with a\nlinear structure and, also by using\ncatalysts, evolves to a complex, nonlinear,\nmulti-causal feedback structure.\nA catalyst is an element or instruction\nadded to a system that causes it to\nchange. For example, there is an old\nsaying that its easier to draw flies to a\nteaspoon of honey than to twenty\npounds of vinegar. Hundreds of randomly\nroaming flies will be attracted to\nand will swarm around a teaspoon of\nhoney. In this case, the honey is the\ncatalyst that creates order out of chaos.\nLet's begin with a discussion of the\nfirst process, creating order out of randomness.\nImagine a structure where a\ngroup of twenty or more people is\nasked to move randomly in the space.\nAfter a few minutes, each person is\ninstructed to keep another person in\nsight at all times while continuing to\nmove randomly. An observable shift in\nthe spatial movement pattern in the\nroom occurs as each person makes\nsubtle adjustments to keep their chosen\nperson in sight. Although still apparently\nchaotic, something more organized\n than the original random movement\noccurs as the eyes become engaged\nin a specific task. Next, each\nperson is asked to keep a second person\ncontinually in sight while still\nkeeping the first in sight. A more\nhighly organized movement pattern\ncan be recognized as participants position\nthemselves to keep both their\npeople in sight. Finally, each person is\nasked to keep three people in sight.\nWhen the third person is added, a\nstrange attractor appears to emerge—\nthe edges of the space become attractors\nas participants begin to gravitate\ntoward them.\nSpecific instructions can set up\nconditions to create attractors that force\ninteractions toward an easily observable\ndirection. The combination of\ngravity and the shape of a bowl will\ncause marbles to end up at the bottom\nof the bowl. In a similar way, when\ntwenty or more people, each trying to\nkeep three others in sight, is combined\nwith the four walls of the space, a\nsituation is created where people end\nup at the edges of the space.\nDissipative structures are, by definition,\nstructures that expend energy as\nthey go through structural transformations.\nThe above score, like many\nimprovisational scores, is an example\nof a dissipative structure, as the participants,\nwithin the four walls, must continually\nexpend energy to keep the\nmovement system intact. (Note that\nthe \"marbles at the bottom of the\nbowl\" example is not a dissipative\nstructure because once they come to\nrest, the marbles do not actively interact\nwith the environment. This is\ncalled a closed system.) The above score\nis an open system because it dynamically\nexchanges energy with the environment,\nmaking it open to change. Let's\nfurther analyze the sequence of events\nin the above dissipative structure.\nThe first stage is simple random\nmovement in the space where a highly\ncomplex order that approaches chaos\nexists because of the infinite choices\navailable to the improvisors. This type\nof system of called far-from-equilibrium\nor chaotic. Structure develops each\ntime a person to keep in sight is added\nto the random movement score because\nit limits the possible choices and becomes\na feedback loop that organizes\nthe patterns in space. It is a dissipative\nstructure because it requires the energy\nof each participant to maintain it.\nFormed by fluctuations that are introduced\ninto a random exchange of energy,\nthis dynamic structure develops\nthrough a series of movement interactions.\nAt the final stage, fluctuations can\ncontinually occur. A person or two\nmay sporadically run through the center\nand to another edge of the space to\nkeep their three persons in sight, which\ncauses others to readjust their positions.\nBased on simple instructions, the\nconstant shifting that occurs is due to\nthe many feedback loops that continually\ninteract Although the final part of\nthe exercise can be allowed to go on\nuntil the structure appears to be static,\nthe fact that each person is watching\nthree others keeps the interaction with\nthe environment alive.\nThe energy that is constantly being\nexpended to maintain the system becomes\nobvious when the instruction to\ndiscontinue the exercise and move\nhowever they like is given. Usually,\nthe participants will breathe a collective\nsigh of relief and immediately allow\nthe structure to dissolve.\nThe point at which a structure\nevolves to a different level of complexity\nis called a bifurcation point. In the\nabove exercise there were three major\nlimitations imposed and each of these\nlimitations created bifurcation points.\nAt each stage of the exercise, the instructions\nforced the behavior to\nchange. Since each person had to keep\nan eye on one or two others, individuals\norganized into a group through\nfeedback loops. As the first and second\nperosns were added, an observable\nshift occurred in the movement patterns\nthroughout the entire space.\nWhen the third person had to be kept\nin sight, this small change, or fluctuation,\ncreated an effect that dramatically\nchanged the spatial orientation of the\nparticipants. This non-linear relationship,\nwhere a small fluctuation can\nhave a major impact, is a unique and\ndramatic aspect of dissipative structures.\nThe reader may be able to think\nof examples from their own improvisations\nin which structure is similarly\ngenerated.\n\nCONTACT IMPROVISATION\nSCORES\nAnother example of a process that\nbegins with a random structure and\nevolves to a complex structure is what\nI'll call a Contact Improvisation landscape\nscore. It is derived from a structure\nI participated in, taught by Nancy\nStark Smith. As they enter the studio\nspace, people begin by \"arriving\" into\nthe sensations of their bodies. Often\nthis is done by lying down and experiencing\ntheir bodies in the state between\nstillness and movement. By doing the\nsmallest possible perceptible movements,\nthey explore their \"skin-\nesphere,\" their bodies inside the skin.\nThey go on to explore their kinesphere,\nor \"reach space,\" as they mobilize their\nbodies into movement and connect\ntheir inner and outer worlds, eventually\ntaking their movement into space.\nThen there is a \"grazing\" stage where\nparticipants move through the space\nand make brief physical contact with\nothers. Eventually, each person maintains\na contact connection with one\nother person and the duet develops.\nHere the attractors of physical contact\nand sharing weight are apparent. A\nfield is generated by using the Contact\nImprovisation duet form within this\nlandscape score.\nThere are many contact scores that\nbegin with a simple, single, cause-and-\neffect structure and build in complexity.\nFor example, there is a simple\nexercise in which two people share and\nshift their weight through back-to-back\ncontact As one person takes a step\nforward, the partner, in order to maintain\ncontact, follows by taking a step\nbackward. The partners can take several\nsteps or even walk back and forth\nthrough the space while continuing to\nmaintain back-to-back contact. However,\nif the partners begin stepping sideways\nslightly, torque is added, and this\nmakes back-to-back contact more difficult\nto maintain, especially if they begin\nto move through the space faster.\nAs the partners begin to lose contact,\nthe exercise approaches chaos or\nthe far-from-equilibrium state. There is\nso much new input in the form of\nspeed, direction, and momentum changes,\nthat the system cannot maintain its\nform. The duet must either evolve to\nanother level of complexity or the\ndance must stop. If the partners maintain\nthe essence of the exercise, it becomes\na complex and unpredictable\ndance, structured by the attractors of\nweight sharing, gravity, momentum,\netc The dance can be described as a\ndissipative structure that is maintained\ndancers within a specific format.\nTo summarize, the above structure\nbegins as a simple set of instructions\n(order) and goes through a phase that\napproaches chaos. As the structure\napproaches chaos or far-from-equilibrium\nconditions, the feedback loop created\nattractors cause it to self-organize to a\nmore complex level, creating a dance.\nEach time the dance evolves from the\nsame exercise, even by the same partners,\nthe direction the dance takes will\nbe entirely different. The exercise is of\nan archetypal order called a dissipative\nstructure because it is created by the\ndissipation of energy in open conditions.\nThis open system is vulnerable\nto minor fluctuations that cause it to\nevolve in a unique direction each time\nthe score is followed.\n\nTHEATER GAMES\n\nLet's take an example of how to go\nfrom the simple to the complex using\ntheater games. With eight to twenty\npeople in a circle, the object of the\ngame is to make a sound of one to four\nsyllables with an associated movement\nand pass it to the next person. That\nperson in turn passes it to the person\nnext to them and so on around the\ncircle. The object is to pass the sound\nand movement exactly as you see and\nhear it It will be observed that even if\neach person passes exactly what they\nsee and hear, they each have a different\nbody and voice, so the sound and/or\nmovement changes slightly. Invariably,\nthe sound changes dramatically even\nafter only a few times around the circle.\nTiny fluctuations build one on the\nother until the final sound and movement\nis completely transformed.\nAnother theater game, common in\ntraditional theater improv, is called\n\"yes-and.\" It goes something like this:\nTwo people enter an empty stage and\ntheir task is to create a spontaneous\ntheater piece. One person will begin\nwith an action or statement that describes\neither where they are, who they\nare to each other, or what they are\ntalking about. One person says something,\nthe next person says \"yes\" to\nthat reality and adds a related element\nto it. The first person now adds another\nelement and this continues back\nand forth until an entire scene is built.\nI will try it now as I'm writing.\nA. This is a nice oak table.\nB. Yeah, I bought it yesterday.\nA. Isn't that full-length mirror new\ntoo?\nB. No. I have had that for a while\nnow. About six months.\nA. I lost three hundred dollars the last\ntime I was here in your apartment.\nB. Yeah, I found it.\nA. Can I have it back?\nB. No. I bought the desk with it.\nAnything I find in my apartment\nautomatically becomes mine.\nA. But I'm your father! I needed that\nmoney to buy your mother our thirtieth\nwedding anniversary gift.\nB. I know. That's why I bought this\ndesk. Isn't thirty years the oak anniversary?\nA. Son! I knew you wouldn't let me\ndown. I'm ashamed to say that I came\nhere not trusting you.\nB. I know, Dad. But I'm sure glad\nthat 20-1 longshot, \"Prodigal Son,\"\nthat I bet the whole three hundred on,\nwon the race. I'm now in the money\nand you're happy.\nA. What?!\nA whole scene was created by\nagreeing to what was just said and\nadding to it. Note that B said no to A's\nrequest for getting his money back.\nThis is still saying \"yes\" to the improvisation\nbecause he agreed that the\nthree hundred dollars existed. The\nwhole scenario was built very quickly\nincreases in complexity until content is\ngenerated. In it, the partners did not\nknow where the story was going, and\ncould not know, because they didn't\nknow what the other person would\nsay. Even so, we discovered in only a\ndozen exchanges, that they were father\nand son, the father was married for\nthirty years, the son was a gambler, the\nfather lost three hundred dollars, they\nwere at the son's apartment and many\nother pieces of information including\nsome undertones of their history.\nThis dissipative structure builds in\ncomplexity by adding elements incrementally.\nIt starts simply and expands\nexponentially as meaning begins to\nmanifest. Soon, the interaction transforms\ninto a scene with place, relationship,\nconflict, and content.\n\nFIELDS IN IMPROVISATION\nThe cumulative effect of the attractors\nin an improvisation creates a field\nthat contains a range of interaction\npossibilities. Within both contact and\nacting improvisations there are many\nscores and approaches, but taken as a\nwhole each has certain characteristics\nthat set it apart from the other.\nIf a collaboration was set up where\none person was experienced in contact\nimprovisation while the other person\nwas experienced in acting improvisation,\nthey would at first be confused\nabout how to approach their explorations\ntogether, which would create an\nopen, chaotic situation. If they persist\nin their collaboraiton, they will evolve\nsome kind of structure together which\ncould be very interesting. This would\nmost likely begin as a more open structure\nthan either of their respective\nforms and the ensuing process would\nbe unique.\nImprovisational forms result from\nmany interconnected feedback loops\nthat create the strange and complex\npatterns called fields. Some of these\nfields have names because they have\nbeen around long enough to have been\nnamed, others will develop names, and\nstill others will exist nameless but\nequally distinct.\n\nGRID-WORK SCORES\n\nAnother example of a field is the\ngrid-work score that I gleaned from\nvarious teachers including Richard\nBull, Robert Dunn, and Danny Lepkoff.\nThe grid is an elementary field within\nwhich interactions take place. Let's use\na basic grid-work score to explore complexity\nwhen working improvisationally.\n\nImagine the following simple grid.\nDivide a square or rectangular space\ninto an infinite number of parallel horizontal\nand vertical lines. The instruction\nis simply to walk along these horizontal\nand vertical lines and turn 90\ndegrees either to the right or the left.\nEnvision the following sequence of\nevents with four improvisors doing this\nscore. After a few minutes, the movement\npatterns become interspersed\nwith recognizable groupings of two,\nthree, or four people. As the improvisors\nbegin to follow their various paths,\nthey intersect more or less randomly.\nAt times they may be at the edges of\nthe space, clustered in the center of the\nspace, randomly interspersed in the\nspace, and in various groupings\nthroughout the space.\n\nEventually the improvisors notice\nfeelings, sensations, patterns and\nthoughts related to where they are in\nthe space and in relation to others in\nthe space. With this added awareness,\nthese randomly produced relationships\ncan generate scenarios, characters, and\nstories. What begins as a simple spatial\ninteraction can transform into complex\ncontent through the many feedback\nloops intrinsic to a human being.\nAn example: Five improvisors are\nwalking randomly in a room Two\npeople begin to follow a line from\nopposite directions so they are on a\ncollision course. They turn simultaneously\nto avoid colliding. After a\nwhile, they walk toward each other\nagain and since each expects the other\nto turn, they collide. Now the interaction\nmay leave the purely spatial realm\nas the improvisors become psychologically\ninvolved. They may look for\nopportunities to walk toward each\nother again and purposely collide, or\nsee how close they can come without\ncolliding. As other improvisors become\naware of this change of focus,\nthey begin to collide with each other or\navoid each other at the last moment.\nThe individuals become a group that\nhas created a field of colliding and\navoiding.\n\nAdding elements to an improvisation\nsuch as entering and exiting,\nsounding and vocalization, polarities\nsuch as moving/stillness, up/down,\nfast/slow, and changes in dynamic\nqualities can act as catalysts to develop\nthe complexity within a score in specific\nways. Consider the following example.\nWalk along the parallel grids\ndescribed above, turning 90 degrees\nright or left. Add the instruction of\nstopping intermittently and moving.\nInteractions develop as the improvisors\nexplore spatial relationships through a\nrhythm of stopping and starting. Now,\nif the direction to turn your head as\nyou walk is added, so that you are\nlooking at other people and the environment,\nthe resulting complexity\nseems to develop more confrontational\nor emotiqnal content. Whatever elements\nare introduced, if the improvisors\nallow complexity to develop without\nforcing their actions, self-organization\noccurs organically.\n\nRandom movements evolve into a\ndissipative structure that, if continued\nlong enough, goes through stages of\ncomplexity. Each time a new element\nis introduced, it will develop fluctuations\nand one of two things may happen.\nThe system may be able to damp\nor inhibit the fluctuations and maintain\nits present form. Or, if the fluctuations\ngenerate enough critical behavior, the\nsystem will be forced to reorganize to a\ngreater level of complexity because it\ncannot integrate the new element in its\npresent form.\n\nWhen a system reorganizes, it does\nso because fluctuations can catalyze the\nself-organization process inherent in its\nfield. It is important to note another\npossibility: a system can dissolve in its\nattempt to reach another level of complexity,\nand random behavior will result.\n\nThe interesting thing about grid\nwork is the transformation of movement\ninto meaning that continually\noccurs within the score. The grid model\nunderscores this movement-into-\nmeaning attractor that, in my opinion,\nis always a part of good improvisation\nand is inherent in the process that leads\nto good composition. If improvisors\ncan follow self-organization processes,\nand allow these processes to influence\nthem, then movement archetypes and\nstructures will form organically.\n\nCONCLUSION\nDue to the diverse nature of various\nattractors in different forms of\nimprovisation, they each self-organize\nin unique ways, dependent on initial\nconditions as well as on added instructions\nor elements. Each improvisation-\nal form; e.g. contact, acting, movement,\nmusic, movement theater, dance theater,\nmusic theater, choreographic, etc.,\nhas a variety of attractors that create\nthe fields within which interactions\noccur. Each form contains its own\nattractor states, due to the rules by\nwhich they play. For example, physical\ncontact is an attractor for contact improvisation\nand creating dialogue is an\nattractor for theater games. These\nforms have an important complex\nelement in common—the human being.\nThis results in an exponentially complex\nsystem.\nIn open improvisations, as participants\nfollow impulses and develop\ncomplexity in the moment, they align\nwith and unleash unpredictabale patterns\nof behavior. These patterns arise\nas a result of the delicate and dynamic\nbalance between chaos and order.\nWhen unique structures form spontaneously\nas improvisations develop, we\nfind that unpredictability, non-linearity,\ncomplexity, asymmetry, and irreversibility\nare the rules and the possibilities\nare limitless. This is the science of\nwhat we experience as the joy, fun,\nexcitement, and enticement of improvisation.\n\n\nQUESTIONS regarding Chaos and Improvisation\n\nIs there absolute reality or only perceived reality? Is there reality\nwithout the observer? Do we see only a part of reality or do we see\nall of reality because we create it? Is there the potential for a multiplicity\nof possible realities in one mind?\n\nWhat is created in improvisation? Is an improvisation only a\nregurgitation of what we already know? Is it simply bringing out what\nis already in us? Can something new be formed in improvisation that\nhas never existed before? Can improvisation be the uncovering of\nexisting patterns and the creation of new patterns?\nWhat is exciting about improvisation? Why improvise? What is improvisation\nmaking a statement about? Is it about the possibility of a\nnew way of being/becoming, an understanding about a universal\nquery or dilemma, delight in discovering the moment? Is it enough to\nimprovise because it’s fun?\n\nIs there a goal to improvisation? Is the goal to be in process? Is\nthat a contradiction in terms?\n\nWhat is the best way to set up the conditions for improvising? Is\nthe universe always improvising or is everything predetermined?\nWhat is chaos and what is order? Is complete chaos possible?\nAre chaos and order only temporary conditions? Are chaos and order\nmutually exclusive or are they only words describing diverse aspects\nof something observed?\n\nWhat creates form? How does form arise? What are we doing\nhere? How did we get here? How did we get to be here? Where\nare we going? Who cares? Why should we care? What does it\nmean to care? What, if anything, is important enough to care about?\nIs that nihilism?\n\nIs something that is complex always more open to change? How\ncomplex must something become before it cannot change or before it\nmust change? How many feedback loops does an open system need\nin order to maintain its integrity?\n\nCan time go backwards? What is time? Does time really exist?\nOr is it the result of change? Is time only a linear progression of\nclock ticks? Is personal time different than clock time? Is time\nbased on perception of how long it takes to do something? Is there\ntime without an observer? Does time arise from the infinite entropy\nbarrier?\n\nDoes improvisation get to the point about time in that the improvisor\ntunes in to the moment and to the concept of constant change? If\ntime doesn’t exist, why is it so difficult to get in touch with the present\nmoment? Or is it? Is it possible to be anywhere except the present\nmoment?",

I wanted some of his rain to fall\non afield in which seeds of a new vocabulary for experience\nare sprouting.\nThe multi-dimensional nature of experiencing the body-\nmind as a whole, is turning out to be such a massive challenge\nto the structure of language that something’s gotta\ngive. Experience has been doing all the giving for so\nlong—letting itself be misrepresented by inadequate models\nand rigid structures—that it’s language’s turn to do some\ngiving. And if anyone is going to be able to turn the fiat map\nof language’s representation of experience into a globe, it’s\ngoing to be dancers: You can’t explore the territory without\nmoving through it. Bob’s research could help us.\nIn suggesting this collaboration, / also had a point I\nwanted to make to the scientific community, through Bob\n(though he is definitely, as he puts it, “an out-of-the-mainstream\nthinker”). I wanted to show that a dance studio with\na group of dancers trained in self-observation and experiential\nthinking is an ideal environment in which to think. And\nnot only think, but gain new insights, solve problems, serious\nglobal problems, by allowing the innate wisdom of the\nbodymind to shed light on them through intuitive metaphorical\nconnections. What logical process can compare with the\nbody’s ability, for instance, to create itself from a single\nfertilized egg? Or even to heal a cut finger?\nTo think of thinkers thinking with no sense of the body’s\nwisdom gives me a cold chill because of the cold conclusions\nthey could come to. No wonder we find ourselves in a world\nrich in heartlessness. Making ourselves of service as\nperspective-enlargers, bodymind thinking advisers, could be\na channel for direct political action. Solutions to impossible\nproblems are the specialty of geniuses, and they generally\nreport having found them through a kinesthetic experience.\nWhether they watch us dance with the images of a problem,\nor move themselves, the chances of triggering such leaps of\nintuition would be increased.\nleap, and he held out his hand and we all leapt with him. He\nhad been woken in the middle of the night with a revelation\nof a possible model of...here I pause, for although the model\nwas exhilaratingly clear (and drawn from current scientific\ntheories on chaos), what it was a model of was so basic, I\ncan only think to call it Presence.\nI don’t think Bob would mind if I said he had started out\nas something of a skeptic regarding the capacity of movement\nimprovisation to deliver profound information. So the fact\nthat observing our process led him to new insights seemed an\nespecially exciting turn of events. In some ways, the model\nhe came up with was a present to us, a portrait of what he\nsaw us doing, and a shift in his focus from tracking meaning\nin language to meaning in experience. For us, it was a gift\nof an elegant language in which to articulate, and perhaps\nexplain, our work when it works best.\nEach day, Bob would begin with a lecture, followed by\ndiscussion. Then I’d suggest ways of taking the key points as\nfoci for moving (alone or with a partner), observing our\nexperiences while entering the states the focus illuminated.\nThen we’d write—immediate, spontaneous expressions of that\nstate. We would then read these “reports” aloud, compare\nour findings, and move on.\nBob’s first order of business was to point out that space\ndoesn’t exist, that it is created in our minds when we’re\nchildren in order to be able to think. Bob then gave us a list\nof motional terms from a paragraph by Aristotle, to show that\nthinking is a choreography of shifting spatial orientations in\nan imagined space where, in order to participate, all of life\nmust be reified, turned into “things.” If you can’t move them\naround, you can’t think about them.\nTo take space away from a dancer who has built up a\ncomplex conceptual relationship to it is asking for trouble.\nThe effect of thinking about this was disturbing to some of us\nat first, but the effect of moving with it was liberating. And\nit provided the ground for what developed into the confirmation\nof experience—rather than thought—as the basis for\nknowledge.\nThe workshop and the writings it produced, some of\nwhich appear in this article, are just the beginning of what\nI hope will continue in the form of further collaborations\nbetween dancers and researchers in other fields, using\nlanguage as the common ground from which to generate the\nexperience of mutual discovery and, staying faithful to that\nexperience, discover new ways to generate language.\n\nBetween October 19th and 23rd, 1992, Christina\nSvane and I offered a seminar, “Spatial Orientation: A Key\nto Meaning in Thought and Movement.” The seminar was\nheld at the School for New Dance Development, Amsterdam,\nunder the auspices of I.D.E.A., International Dance Exchange\nof Amsterdam. It was inspired by my ongoing research into\nthe ontogeny of the concept of space and the role that body\npostures and movements play in the processes of abstract\nthinking. Although these two areas might at first seem\ndisparate, in practice they are intimately interrelated, especially\nfor dancers.\nThis seminar proved a valuable learning experience both\nfor me and Christie, and for the dancers. For my part, it\nprovided an opportunity to have people experienced in\nkinaesthetic perception and body movement test my hypotheses\nfirsthand and to report back to me the details of their\nfindings. As they reported at the end of the seminar, the\ndancers discovered within the ideas presented new dimensions\nto the possibilities of dance, which enriched their abilities to\nperform and even simply to explore improvisatory movement,\ncertainly part of the matrix of creativity in dance.\nThe seminar began with the examination of how we\nconstruct our notion of space. I found that dancers generally\nentertain “space” as a rather concrete “something” that acts\nas a kind of silent partner in their movements. I state that\nwith purposeful ambiguity because each dancer had a slightly\ndifferent concept of space as it related to dancing. Some saw\nit as a medium in which to move; others, as a framework by\nwhich to orient their movements.\nMy approach to the concept of space is anchored in the\nhistory of it in the physical sciences, the philosophical\nanalysis of it by the neo-Kantians, notably Hans Vaihinger,\nand the perspective of developmental psychology, drawing\nheavily on the work of Jean Piaget. I presented this approach\nnot as a revealed truth but as an alternative. For the dancer,\nthis approach has the consequence of directing attention away\nfrom the supposed external framework, the absolute framework\nof Newtonian physics, the benchmarks around the room\nrelative to which the dancer conceives her movements, and\nrefocuses it on the dancer’s body. In other words, rather than\nperceiving the physical ambiance as that to which her\nmovements are oriented, the dancer refocuses on herself as\nthe fulcrum of movement and the primary measure of what\nher movements mean. This refocusing takes place—and this\nis extremely important—within the context of a restructuring\nof inner experience. It is this restructuring, this phenomenological\ntransformation, that is the launching pad for a new\nor extended repertoire for thinking about movement and\nactually projecting this thought into dance.\nPrecisely here the dancers reported a significant expansion\nin the practice of their dancing. This new notion of space\nopened to them hitherto unrecognized paths for experiencing\ntheir own bodies and for moving in choreographically\nmeaningful ways. Mary Overlie, one of the participants in\nthe seminar, put it this way in her notes:\n“I had a very strong and amazing experience when I\nworked by myself with the word ‘through’ in conjunction\nwith moving without the concept of space. I\nsuddenly had a whole new movement vocabulary\navailable to me that I recognized as what some\ndancers automatically have and which I have never\nbeen able to find. It had to do with how I was\nconceiving my movements. I had for many years and\nperhaps always moved with a strong concept of space\nand this took away some of the very consequential\nquality that some dancers have: ‘This is it, this is all\nthere is, it stops here'. Very heavy, weighted and\nsubstantial [quality] because it is not spreading itself\nout beyond into the negative of the unseen.\"\nPatricia Bardi, another of the participants, observed that “I let\ngo of the deliberateness of seeing, sensing, imagining,\ncarrying upwards and outwards.” I take this to mean that she\nfocused on her body-centered present moment, what Christie\ncame aptly to call the ‘‘now plane.”\nI think it worth emphasizing that this whole exercise in\nconceptual transformation—changing from conceiving space\nas a “thing” to thinking of it as a mental artifice—took place\nas much through movement exploration as through discussion.\nIt was part of the artfulness brought by Christie to this\nenterprise that she had the dancers explore through movement\nall of the abstract matters placed before them in discussions.\nThis made the learning experience more complete, more\nholistic, for the participants while providing me with invaluable\nfeedback. That the dancers reported crucial changes in\ntheir experience of movement after assimilating the new\napproach to space gave empirical evidence for the pivotal\nnature of conceptual space in the co-creation of meaning and\nmovement in dance.\nHaving established a revised orientation to space, we\nmoved in the seminar to the examination of the role of body\nmovement and posture in the process of thinking. This\ntouched on the heart of my own research, which began from\na study of the function of metaphor in human thought. My\npoint of departure had been the thesis of George Lakoff and\nMark Johnson in their book, Metaphors We Live By (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1980). According to Lakoff\nand Johnson, our attitudes toward various ideas may be\ngleaned from everyday expressions about these ideas. When\nwe use expressions such as, “I shot his argument down,”\n“She won the debate,” and “His argument crumbled under\nattack,” we are plainly treating argumentation as if it were a\nform of warfare. Warfare, in other words, is our metaphor\nfor argumentation. We could just as well conceive it as a\nform of dance. In that case, we might use expressions such\nas, “She made beautiful countermoves to each sortie,” “Our\npoints coincided rhythmically,” etc.\nWhat is crucial to the Lakoff and Johnson thesis, it\nseemed to me, was that we can understand any one thing\nonly in terms of another. Metaphor, therefore, is central to\nhuman thought. With that in mind, I began collecting the\nmetaphors underlying the great ideas of Western philosophy,\nthen branched out to include law, religion and the sciences.\nThis led me to the surprising discovery that in the entire\nhistory of civilization, all the major ideas were based on 29\nbasic metaphors, forming what might be called a genetic\nalphabet of human thought. To support this hypothesis, I\nbegan to trace the etymology of the vocabularies surrounding\nthese major ideas, with the intent that, if the roots for these\nvocabularies clustered around the governing metaphors, it\nwould lend support to my hypothesis.\nIt was in carrying out this comparative etymological\nresearch that I noticed a curious fact: many abstract nouns are\nformed from a concrete nominative or verbal core to which\na spatial prepositional or postpositional element is attached\nAcross languages this is true. Take the word, “prediction.”\nThe core, “diction,” meant originally “the act of saying.”\nThe prefix, “pre,” means “before.” Thus, prediction is a\n“saying before.” Further, I went on to notice, the key words\nwhich seem to advance any discourse are words of motion,\nthat is, words that either indicate a motion or that contain\nwithin themselves etymological remnants of motional\nmeaning. “Involve,” for example, has the root “volvere,” a\nLatin verb meaning “to turn.”\nFrom all this, I deduced that motion must somehow\nunderlie our thought processes. I then remembered Piaget’s\nresearch into the mental development of children, which\nshowed that children first learn to think by internalizing\naction schemes. An action scheme is a movement or series\nof movements required to accomplish a given end, like\nwalking, picking up an object, throwing it, and so on. On the\nrough rule of thumb that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,\nor that the development of the species and of the individual\nparallel each other, my final hypothesis, the one I brought to\nthe seminar, was that the architecture of human thought was\nerected around the experience of what the body can do and\nhow objects can be manipulated. A similar thesis is found in\nMark Johnson’s The Body in the Mind: The Bodily Basis of\nMeaning, Imagination, and Reason (Chicago and London:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1987), but Johnson pursues a\nmuch broader course than mine primarily because he did not,\nas I did, begin from a concise system of universal metaphors.\nThe specific manipulations I consider are covered under what\nmathematicians call topological transformations. These are\ntransformations that, roughly speaking, alter the position,\nlocation or overall shape of an object.\nIt should now become obvious why the refocusing of the\ndancer’s attention on his own body as foreground, through\nthe reconceptualization of space, would be important to the\nexploration of primal meaning in movement. Space, time,\nmass, gravity, inertia and countless other essential abstractions\nfrom which our reality is formed are not so much\nexternal a priori givens as they are a posteriori creations out\nof the matrix of body experience. The exigencies of daily\nlife make us put the cart before the horse. These abstractions\narose to facilitate action and survival, so they must be\nassumed, which means they are unconsciously given the\nstatus of so-called objective reality rather than being held as\npart of the social construction of reality.\nFor dance and movement research, this strongly suggests\nthat there is a core repertoire of movements and body\npostures or attitudes that carry in them a fixed set of meanings.\nIt seems possible that this repertoire might offer the\nmuch needed conceptual framework around which to create\nan objective nomenclature to describe dance and dance-\nrelated movement. Comparative etymological research\nindicates that this repertoire is transcultural, that it has the\nvalue of universal applicability. However, the collective\nexperience of participants in the seminar demonstrated that\nthe role of this putative repertoire is not by any means\nstraightforward. Nevertheless, I believe it can be delineated\nfrom outside dance—through linguistic analysis, gestural\nstudy, and topology—and then sorted out, so to speak, in the\nexperience of dance and body movement research.\nOne of the exercises in the seminar had dancers exploring\nthe topological notion of “in.” They were free to do this in\nwhatever way struck them, and afterward, they noted down\ntheir experiences. I quote in part the notes of Mary Overlie\non this exercise:\n‘“in’ without perspective, just detail, just knowing,\nless and less direction forward, quickly reduces to a\nstate like standing in a room and taking in all I can.”\nThis captures nicely the phenomenological character of the\nexperience, and then she goes on:\n“the best vehicle for ‘in’ seems to be love rather than\ngreed because love allows me to be in and in and in,\nseeing more and more ways to be in.”\nShades of James Joyce’s Molly Bloom. What is to be noted\nhere is the complication of personal association. Our\nexperiences are never pure in the sense of consisting only of\nsome primal meaning element stripped of personal association.\nNor is personal association the only layer imposed on\nany primal core of meaning. There is also the layer of\ncultural conditioning. Dance movements characteristic of an\nethnic tradition exemplify, but certainly do not exhaust, the\ncultural patina. Gestures, gaits, rites, and everyday routines\nalso go to make up the cultural layer.\nRecognition of these complications led to the unanticipated\nconsideration in the seminar of the creative process in\ndance; exactly how does a dance, a movement improvisation,\nevolve from the central viewpoint of the dancer? In attempting\nto answer this question, I introduced a holographic model\nof brain function that has a fairly wide acceptance in current\nneurology and cognitive science. Coupling this to a fractal\nhierarchy, we arrived at a model that the dancers felt accorded\nwell with their experiences in improvisation and choreography.\nFor those unfamiliar with holography and fractal mathematics,\na few words of explanation may be in order. First,\na hologram is a special kind of photograph produced with\ncoherent light. One laser beam is focused on something to be\nphotographed and the reflected light returning to the photographic\nplate is allowed to interact with a reference beam\nfrom a mirror. Where the two beams come together, the light\nwaves create patterns of interference, resembling what might\nbe seen by throwing thousands of pebbles all at once into a\npond. When the photographic plate is backlighted by a laser,\nthe original scene is seen as if through a window, in three\ndimensions.\nHolograms have two remarkable properties that make\nthem ideal models for information storage in the brain. First,\nsimply by altering the angle of the photographing laser, you\ncan store hundreds of images on a single plate. The images\nremain discrete and clear. Second, every part of the hologram\ncontains the whole image. The smaller the fragment,\nthe fuzzier the image but it is everywhere present in a\ncomplete form. These properties correspond to our present\nunderstanding of how the brain works.\nAs for fractals, they are patterns with the unique property\nof self-similarity. This means that no matter how greatly you\nmagnify any one part, you see a pattern similar to the whole.\nThe analogy to holograms is obvious. Fractals are generated\nTechnically, x = f(y) and y = f(x). What is unique about\nrecursive functions is that you can calculate them only step\nequation for y before the consequent value of y may then be\nused to figure out the next value of x, and so on. Recursive\nfunctions therefore are at once deterministic and yet unpredictable.\nYou cannot project ahead to future values without\npassing through all the intervening steps.\nI introduced the hypothesis of a fractal hierarchy to\nexplain how the mind operates in improvisational dance\nbecause it accounts well for how the dancer passes from\nimage (hologram) to image logically but unpredictably. The\nbasic notion is that each moment-as-experienced grows out of\nthe previous one deterministically but often unpredictably.\nThen, if the dancer is conceived as embedded always in a\nlarger context, part of the whole, we have a fractal hierarchy.\nMathematically it can be shown that such a hierarchy can\nexplain how the mind and the universe operate according to\nmany traditions of mysticism as well as the principles of\nmodern theoretical physics. We all found it rather remarkable\nthat certain mystical concepts that had evolved centuries\nago could also be deduced through purely scientific principles\nand that they could then be verified, at least in a limited way,\nthrough the experience of dance.\nLooking back on all this now, I feel that a surprising\namount was achieved in that modest seminar in Amsterdam.\nIt helped me sort out my ideas on how body movement\nunderlies thought, and it evidently enriched the creative\nability of the dancers, judging by their comments. From the\nresults of the seminar, I have been able to begin developing\na comprehensive framework for the analysis and description\nof dance movement in which core universal meanings link\nwith cultural-gestural norms and complexes of personal\nassociations. Working out this framework is helping me\nmore concretely realize my original thesis about the role of\nbody movement in thought processes and, at the same time,\nis making possible a system of body movement analysis that\nshould be valuable to the dance community at large. I hope\nto be able to continue this research with Christie and others\nin further seminars.\n\n“NOW PLANE” REPORT / Christina Svane\nThe watched pot boils slowly. The Now Plane is always\nfull of portraits. What is difficult is to find any reason\nto move. Breath. Neglected joints, tissues, request it.\nRegarding the intersection of Now and Image, the image\nhad first to be awareness of body. So many layers to be\naware of. This process has a preparation phase. The Now\nPlane does hinge upon the body. The body needs time to\nremember its own complex chords. One doesn't hear all\nthe instruments in the orchestra at once. Roving is part of\nNow. Images fleet. A fleet of images. An association\nseems the next step. Image first. Awareness.

    "Content": "Introduction\nI came to Kinetic Awareness\nthrough curiosity and frustration.\nThroughout my years of dancing (ballet\nsince the age of 6), fundamental questions\nabout the body and its functioning\nemerged, but were never answered\nto my satisfaction. I never got a real\nanswer to: How do my muscles work\nwhen I do a plie, or: How can I relax\nmy shoulders? Why do they get stuck?\n\"Pull up\" did not make any sense to\nme. Or even \"release\"—How could I\nrelease?\nWhen I came to New York from\nCape Town, South Africa, I followed an\nhistorical dance trail. First I studied\nGraham, Cunningham, and Erick Hawkins\ntechniques, then Ideokinesis and\nContact Improvisation. Finally I landed\non the floor in Elaine Summers's loft\non 537 Broadway. There, in a room\nfilled with people lying on blankets\napparently doing nothing much, I finally\nfound some profound answers to my\nquestions. Elaine gave me the guidance,\nbut also the opportunity, time,\nenvironment, and the \"tools\" to find\nout the answers I needed. Her work,\nKinetic Awareness, allowed me to trust\nthat my body knows how to move and\nhow to take care of itself.\nThe roots of the philosophy of\nKinetic Awareness go back to Elsa\nGindler who worked in Germany in\nthe 1930s. About the time of the Second\nWorld War her students brought\nher work to America where Elaine got\nto know it through Carola Speads,\nwhose work, Physical Reeducation,\nemphasizes breathing and movement.\n(Her book, The ABCs of Breathing, is an\ninvaluable resource.)\n\nConfronted with osteo-arthritis and\nfaring the possibility of an end to her\ndance career, Elaine chose the path of\nself-healing. The inspiration of\nSpeads's work plus months of intense\nself-observation, led Elaine to create\nKinetic Awareness, a system that identifies\nareas of excess tension in the\nbody.\nIn Kinetic Awareness, through\nsimple movements, done with the assistance\nof a hollow rubber ball, excess\ntension is released and better mobility,\ncontrol, and coordination results. The\nsystem can also be used for the prevention\nof injuries and for reducing psychological\nstress.\nAs a dancer and choreographer of\nthe Judson Church Group in the 1960s,\nElaine participated in the examination\nand incorporation of everyday movement\ninto the dance vocabulary, and\nwas involved in the intense discussion\namong the choreographers about approaches\nto dance technique. Dance\ncolleagues Trisha Brown, Meredith\nMonk, and David Gordon, and musicians\nsuch as Pauline Oliveros, studied\nKA with her at that time. Since then,\ndancers Eiko and Koma, Dana Reitz,\nMerian Soto, Patti Bradshaw, among\nothers, plus many singers, actors, and\npeople from all walks of life have benefited\nfrom her work.\n\nWhat is Kinetic Awareness?\n*\nKinetic Awareness is a system of\nbodywork in which all parts of the\nbody are encouraged to be free to\nmove in all of the directions in which\niPs possible for them to move. All the\nsystems are important: the skeletal,\nmuscular, circulatory, digestive, nervous,\netc.\nOur cells have intelligence. If we\ntake the time to listen to them, they can\nbe trusted to respond. We have many\nlevels of awareness /intelligence: Intellect,\nEmotion, Visual mind, Kinetic\nmind, Verbal mind, Auditory, etc.\nKinetic Awareness is the awakening of\nthe Kinetic Mind, and its liberation\nfrom the excessive control over it by\nthe intellect and the emotions, so that\nthe body is better able to work harmoniously\nwith the other levels of intelligence,\nnot against them\nThe work is experiential, based on\nthe students' own observations. Anatomy\nis taught and pictures of the body\nstudied, to awaken the students' internal\nvision of their own body. A student\nmay look at a picture of a pelvis\nfor years before really \"feeling\" and\n\"seeing\" their own pelvis. In my own\nteaching, I also encourage drawing\nwith the non-dominant hand to uncover\nunconscious images and clarify body\nawareness.\nThe first level of work is done on\nthe floor, lying on hollow rubber balls.\nThe ball isolates the sensation of the\nindividual parts from the rest of the\nbody, allowing the student to experience\neach body part separately. The\nballs are also a psychological aid to\nincrease concentration and provide a\npoint of focus. Because of the roundness\nof the balls, movement in many\ndirections is possible. And, of course,\nthey massage the muscles as well.\nA goal of KA is to free the body so\nthat it is always moving away from pain\nand towards pleasure, hopefully doing\nthis without our having to \"think\"\nabout it, and without our inhibiting it.\nThe work is divided into five\nphases:\n\n1. The student becomes aware of\neach body part and is able to articulate\nevery part of the body on its own\nthrough slow concentrated movements\nwith as little tension as possible, as\nslowly as possible, with or without the\nuse of the balls.\n2. The student is able to move\nmore than one body part at a time and\nintegrate many movements simultaneously.\nAllover body systems such as\nbreathing and circulation are explored.\n3. The student is able to change the\nlevel of tension, or \"electricity,\" from\nvery low, to very high tension, at will.\n4. The student is able to vary their\nspeed of movement from very slow to\nextremely fast.\n5. The student is able to do all the\nprevious levels—articulate each part of\nthe body, breathe freely, manipulate\ntension and speed, move through space\nand relate to others.\n\nA central theme in this system is\nthe understanding of tension as a positive\nand necessary part of movement.\nTension, or \"electricity,\" is understood\nas the energy necessary to move the\nbody. It becomes negative only when\nit is held unconsciously, which we call\n\"frozen tension.\" Somebody with apparently\nincorrect posture who moves,\nmay be better off than somebody with\n\"perfect\" posture who tries to hold\ntheir posture with excessive tension.\nKA is a complete body therapy in that\nit takes students through release and\nreintroduces them to the use of tension.\n(However, many people are so delighted\nchoose to stay at that level.)\nPart of the success of the work is its\nunderstanding of the psychological\naspects of physical holding patterns.\nWilhelm Reich called this psychological/\nphysiological phenomenon \"muscle\narmoring.\" When frozen tension starts\nto release, hidden memories and associated\nemotions may also be released.\nOften the tension patterns are related\nto very early childhood, a preverbal\nstage, when purely physical responses\nsuch as crying, tantrums, and expressions\nof joy may have been inhibited.\nAs the student of KA begins releasing\nsome of this \"muscle armoring,\" they\noften spontaneously remember and\nhave dreams of early childhood events.\nIn KA, while working physically\nwith any part of the body, one may be\nconfronted by emotions that have been\nlocked away for many years. Thus the\nstudent often embarks on a deep journey\nof self-exploration and self-integration.\nThis takes courage. Students are\ninvited to share their feelings and emotions\nduring the work and later in\ngroup discussions. Importantly, the\ndefenses of the individual are allowed\nto remain in place until they are ready\nto be released. Because there is no\ninterference by others (the student has\ncontrol over the ball and can stop\nwhenever necessary) the student is able\nto journey at his/her own pace, until\nthe inner circumstance for change is\nright.\nIn many ways this work is hardest\nfor dancers. They have invested hours,\nmonths, years, in studying and moulding\nthemselves into specific techniques,\nand sorting out the endless theories of\nturnout and breathing. They may have\nignored the body's essential system of\npain and pleasure and not realized the\nhigh degree of tension they hold unnecessarily.\nUnfortunately it is often\nan injury that forces them to reconsider\nthese habitual movement patterns.\nKinetic Awareness as a Dance\nTechnique and Creative Tool\nIn 1981 Elaine invited me to participate\nin her Kinetic Awareness dance\nclass. It was a three-hour class starting\nwith ball work on the floor, going\nthrough all the elements of basic dance\ntechnique, and ending in wild and\nwonderful dancing. We explored extremely\nslow and very fast movement,\nmovement memory and repetition,\nstretches, balance and momentum,\nshape, speed, tension, all improvised,\nallowing us to come to grips with our\nown limitations and physical givens.\nWe practiced basic movement building\nblocks like plies, extensions, elevations,\nbut we could choose the specific kind\nwe wanted to do (plit first position or\nsecond, grand or demi, etc.). This technique\nclass became a place where one\ncould really reconsider and improve,\npractice, vent frustrations, find new\nmovement, notice patterns and preferences,\nand solve problems. It was also\na class to discover one's strong desire\nto dance. A nursery for the incubation\nof new ideas.\nThe last section of the class was\nspent on performing and, most importantly,\nobserving each other. Most\nilluminating to me was Elaine's interest\nin all kinds of bodies and their individual\nabilities. We learned to appreciate\nwhat each person could achieve when\nthey considered their physical abilities\nas gifts and not as liabilities.\nThis class inspired me to continue\nexploring Kinetic Awareness in dance,\napplying it to dance training and choreography.\nBecause of the dynamic nature of\nthe technique (one is always moving)\nand because of its emphasis on selfexploration\n(physical and emotional),\nKinetic Awareness is an excellent creative\ntool. As soon as movement and\nemotions start to flow, ideas come\nforward. Students are encouraged\nearly on to take the work and make it\ntheir own, finding ways to tailor it to\ntheir own individual needs and integrate\nit into their own ongoing work.\nKA practitioners have used this work\nfor voice, acting, writing, dance, other\nbodywork, helping people overcome\nincest, etc.\n\nAs a choreographer and improvisor\nI am interested in spontaneous movement\nand am searching for structures\nto make the subtleties of authentic\nmovement visible. I feel that the study\nof improvisation is like the study of\nchaos, there is some order there but\nwhere? I am committed to dancing\nfrom the inside out and communicating\nthis with my audience.\nI am also interested in true virtuosity,\nwhen a dancer goes beyond his/\nher own limits. When the body has\nfound freedom of movement, it moves\nthrough spectacular positions, forms,\nand rhythms. Giving way to momentum\nallows the body to take risks that\nif we \"thought about them\" we would\nconsider impossible. I enjoy the moments\nin performance when I, as the\nperformer, am surprised by what my\nbody can do.\nI am interested in working with\ndancers as dynamic and creative individuals\nwho don't hold back their\ncreative problem-solving but give everything\nto the creative process and\nfeel a part of it. Using KA, I train\ndancers to improvise and be able to\nmake kinetic decisions that are informed\nand their emotions. The honesty\nof this highly aware state is transmitted\nto anyone watching, whether in a class\nor a performance. Very often, after\nperformances done by dancers trained\nin KA, the audience responds physically,\nnot with words—instead of telling\nme what they responded to, an audience\nmember will actually do the movement.\nTheir bodies directly experience\nand retain the kinetic communication.\nI see performance as an exchange\nof energy, and Kinetic Awareness has\ngiven me a language with which to\nexplore this communication. For example:\nDo you send your energy out, or\ndo you pull an audience's attention in?\nHow is your awareness communicated\nthrough the face, and especially the\neyes?\n\nThe experiential language of KA\nranges from the slow, detailed listening\nto one's own sensations and experiences\nin the ball work; to exercises where\none learns to play with tension/elec-\ntricity/energy and be able to direct it\nanywhere in the body; to work with\nvision, exploring different ways of\nusing the eyes/focus while moving; to\nwork with the alignment of the knee\njoint and as part of our spring and\nshock-absorbing system; to periods of\ntime just \"letting the body stretch itself,\"\nwhere one learns to allow the\nkinetic mind to move the body without\ninterference from the intellectual mind,\nfinding the body's own desire to move\nand following that. Beyond any of the\nspecific vocabulary, KA is simply the\ncultivation of kinetic awareness—in any\nmoment of moving and being. Everyone\nuses the language differently.\nTo be able to learn all these things\none needs extended study time. So, in\n1990, in New York City, dancer friend\nNina Martin and I -started the New\nYork Dance Intensive, a year-long\ntraining program in which we offer\ntraditional dance, KA, contact improvisation,\nand developmental movement\nside by side. The emphasis is on integration\nand the realization that if we\ntake care of our bodies, our creative\negos will blossom as well. Often we\nfeel as though we are really teaching\ncreative thinking and the ability to\nconsider problems from many perspectives.\nThe Intensive is an opportunity\nto be challenged from many viewpoints\nat the same time.\nMy choreographic work is, like the\nIntensive, highly idealistic. I try to get\npeople to work from a place of deep\nattention and physical/emotional honesty.\nI believe I walk a fine line between\ntherapy and dance but this edge\nis rich and full of excitement.\nJust as Elaine's classes were truly\ndemocratic, empowering people to\ndiscover and work from their own\nbodily experiences, this way of working\nhas challenged me to open my\ncreative self to dancers and challenge\nthem to share their creativity with me.\nKinetic Awareness is not a style. It\nis not a specific form of movement.\nRather, it is an experiential vocabulary\nthat I use to open an individual to their\nown style or sense of individuality. In\nKA, the philosophy is supported by the\nphysical technique, which is based on\nthe way our neuro-muscular-skeletal\nsystem is structurally designed to function.\nThis leads to an efficient use of\nthe body while developing its strength\nand dynamic movement possibilities.\nThe challenge I give myself as a choreographer/\nteacher is to train dancers to\nbe unafraid of using their imaginations\nand creativity while giving them the\nstructures within which they can use\ntheir talents.\nA dancer without a deep understanding\nof his/her kinetic mind,\nwhose kinetic mind is not connected to\nthe intellect and the emotions is, to me,\nnot a fully trained dancer. All the\npirouettes in the world, all the spectacular\nphysical feats cannot impress me\nas much as a simple movement that\noriginates from a deep feeling of alive-\nness and understanding of the miracle\nof the human body.\n\n\nKINETIC AWARENESS AND CONTACT IMPROVISATION\n\nKinetic Awareness and Contact\nImprovisation connect in a helpful and\nlogical manner that is beneficial to the\nbeginning dancer as well as the more\npracticed one. Over the years, Contact\ndancers have sought out and studied\nmany different forms of release work\nand bodywork to enhance their perceptions\nand dancing. Among these are\nBody-Mind Centering, Authentic Movement,\nKlein Technique, Release techniques,\nAlexander Technique, and\nKinetic Awareness. I would like to\ncommunicate my experience linking the\npractices of Kinetic Awareness and\nContact Improvisation.\nI began teaching Contact Improvisation\nin 1977 in New York City and\nfrom the beginning was intimidated by\nthe breadth of knowledge that students\nneeded to have in order to take the form\nto its most demanding and sophisticated\nlevels. When I began to study Contact,\nas a former gymnast and diver I already\nhad an appreciation of spherical space\nand a great deal of control of my weight\nin terms of coordinating with outside\nbodies. But many of my students came\nfrom a more “normal” background\nwhere they operated most comfortably\nmoving upright and in a forward direction,\nwith a lack of nuance in the control\nof their mass while moving into the\nfloor and other bodies. I often thought\nthat it might be a good idea for them to\npractice on an inanimate object as I did\nin my sports (uneven parallel bars,\ntrampoline, free fall in diving) in order\nto refine their spatial orientation and\nweight-giving skills rather than learning\nfrom the start on another human being.\nThis experiment became possible\nthrough the practice of Kinetic Awareness,\nwhich many of my students have\nstudied for the past five years with\nFrances Becker.\nIn 1986 Frances and I wanted to\nextend our dance work into coteaching.\nWe also felt that, historically, our generation\nwouldn’t be the ones to create\nnew forms, but rather that through\njuxtaposing the many different movement\nforms and practices that have\nemerged over the last two decades, new\nperceptions of dance training and performance\ncould be found. We began to\ncoteach a class that combined Kinetic\nAwareness and Contact Improvisation\nand were excited by the process and the\ndancing.\nIn Kinetic Awareness one learns\nabout one’s body through a tactile relationship\nwith a rubber ball, from which\nit is a logical progression to work with\na complex human body. One benefit of\nthis coteaching is that students seem to\nbe less injurious to themselves and\nothers after doing the ball work, because\nin KA they have a lot of time to\nobserve their habits and patterns while\nmoving on their own. They learn to\nrelease unnecessary muscle tension\nwhile actively moving, without the added\ncomplications of hyperactivity, nervousness,\nand adrenaline rushes that\ncan happen with the physical intimacy\nof Contact.\nTeaching beginners Contact after or\nwhile they’re studying Kinetic Awareness\nmakes my job immeasurably easier.\nWith the experience of KA, students\ncome to Contact having already begun\nthe process of learning to pay attention\nthrough the body, letting the mind observe\nwhile being actively engaged with\nthe ball. 1 can then devote myself to\nteaching the complex interactions of the\nduet form that are the heart of Contact\nImprovisation.\nWe continued developing this collaborative\nclass in New York in private\nstudio workshops and at the Laban\nInstitute and Movement Research and\nwere able to put our theories to the test\nover the long term at the Experimental\nTheater Wing at New York University\nwhere the students could study the work\nover the course of a whole year. From\nthere we felt that what we really needed\nwas our own training program and so,\nin 1990, we started the New York Dance\nIntensive.\n\nNina Martin\n\n\n\nKINETIC AWARENESS NECK EXERCISE \n\n\nIf you move every part of your body all the ways it can move without pain, often, at any time during the day,\nyour body will become three-dimensionally centered, the tonicity of your musculature will be balanced, strong, and flexible.\nOur bodies love to move. Movement is necessary to our whole sense of well being, confidence, and joy. It is amazing\nhow delicious the movement feels when you are focusing on and moving only one part of your body, very slowly, listening\nand paying attention to your self. Feelings of comfort, fluid, flowing energy and a general sense of well being and delight\ncan be felt, knowing that your body is being well taken care of by you and that you are gaining an understanding of your\ncomplex, marvelous, interrelating systems.\nThe purpose of moving slowly is to give yourself a chance to listen and understand what your body is experiencing\nand how it can move in as many ways as possible with as little tension as possible, without pain. It also gives you a chance\nto observe the way your body works without imposing value judgements, just observing \"how does my neck move, what\ndoes it feel/sense as it moves?\"\nIdeally your body should be able to move in all the directions natural to that particular part of your body, feeling the\nmovement as pleasant. The movement itself increases your articulation and extends your flexibility. Most of our life from\ninfancy onward we are taught to move as quickly as possible, without much thought about appropriate tension patterns or\nalignment. If we are lucky, we have time during infancy to learn by trying out and experimenting with our body. Gradually\nour parents’ or guardians' expectations, desires, and requirements may come to supercede or suppress our own feelings\nand sometimes even the development of our natural kinetic/physical intelligence. By concentrating, by listening, allowing\nour proprioceptive system to talk to us, we can realize and enjoy the ordinary wonders of our individual mind/body/spirit and\nour own special gifts.\n\nGENERAL INSTRUCTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS TO KEEP IN MIND\n\nChoose a place in which you feel comfortable, safe, and warm: where you will not be interrupted.\nChoose a firm, flat, horizontal surface to lie on, perhaps a wooden floor, or a firm bed.\nRemember that tension is the way we use our energy to move every part of ourselves. Tension is wonderful. Tension\nis our movement power. You can not move without energy/tension.\nWhile working with one part of your body, you can rest other parts in passive, healing positions. For example, while\nworking with your neck, support your legs with pillows, so that your knees are bent. This is very good for your lower back.\nYou may wish to also place a pillow under your ankles, or just rest your lower legs on a chair, couch, or cushion, or extend\nyour legs vertically, resting your feet against the wall.\nEach body part is independent and can initiate its own movement, in this case the neck. The head can follow the\nmovement of the neck as it will.\nIn order to discover what articulations and movement abilities are natural to your neck, it is a good idea to begin\nexploring movement possibilities without the use of the balls. From any position, just by moving your neck gently in all the\ndirections it can go, very slowly, you will discover where areas of pain or discomfort may be. Pain is often caused by frozen\ntension, neuro-muscular asymmetry, or an injury resulting in limitations to your coordination and freedom of movement.\nPain is one of the most important ways that our body talks to us: it is essential that you do not make yourself\nmove through pain. If you discover that a movement causes pain, move away from the pain, and continue moving by\ntrying to approach the area from another direction; gradually the movement and your concentration will help that injured part\nbecome well, and you will know it because the movement and the body part will no longer be painful.\n\n\nNECK EXERCISE — First Phase\nThe First Phase of Kinetic Awareness is articulating all possible pain-free movements of a body\npart, through slow concentrated movements.\nYou may choose to work without any rubber balls, lying down, sitting in a chair, or standing, or with\na 5’ or 6 ' rubber ball. (Plastic balls are fine, but I prefer the feeling of the rubber surface and its\nresponse.) Place the bail dose to you, so that when you are ready to work with it, you will not have\nto change your resting position.\n\n1. Lie down on your back. vour egs rnay be extended, or your knees may be supported by pillows.\n2. Allow yourself a few minutes to let every part of your body melt and be supported. Consider\nwhat you are feeling at this moment. Try to let your body/mind/spirit totally relax. Notice the parts of\nyour body that are holding unnecessary tension. Do not wait for perfection.\nLet your neck rest in center. Center is the place where you do not have to do anything, where\nyour neck can just be. Is your neck experiencing pleasure, discomfort, or pain? Does it feel flexible\nor tight?\n3. If you are working with the balls; place a 5\" or 6\" ball under the base of your skull [photo 3].\nAllow your head to rest comfortably on the ball. If at any time during the action you feel insecure or\nthat your head may roll off the ball, place it more comfortably.\n4. When you sense that you are ready, let your neck turn very slowly to one side (allowing your\nhead to follow) [photo 4], concentrating on all the changes that you are experiencing. For\nexample, notice the way gravity affects your eyes, lips, tongue, jaw, hair; the distance between your\near and your shoulder; the lengthening, shortening, or holding of your muscles on one side or the other.\nDo you need the amount of tension you are using? Maybe you are sending irrelevant tension to your\njaw or eyebrows or toes? Can you release the unnecessary tension? By moving slowly you give\nyourself a chance to become aware of the state your neck is in now and perhaps of what your neck\nhas experienced in your life.\nIf you discover pain, do not push through the pain. Pause, move down or up, exploring ways\nto continue. Try to find a way to continue the movement that is pain-free. If that is not possible, return\nto center, as slowly as possible.\nWhen you have moved your neck as far to one side as possible, wait, take a deep easy breath,\nexhale, and wait, perhaps it will go a little further on its own.\n5. Return to center. Come back as slowly as possible, observing any differences that you may\nfeel. You are now moving away from gravity. Is it more difficult? Are you using more tension? What\ndo you notice, experience?\n6. Turn your neck slowly to the other side as far as it will go [photo 6], always observing what\nyour neck is feeling, never pushing through or keeping your neck in a painful position. What are other\nparts of your body, including your emotions, experiencing? When you have gone as far to that side as\npossible, take a deep breath, exhale, and wait fora moment to see if your neck would like to go a little\nfurther.\n7. Return slowly to center again, observing any changes that you feel. Take a deep breath,\nexhale, and wait a moment, as perhaps you are able to let your neck just be in center.\n8. Extend the front of your neck as far as possible, arching so that your head is resting evenly\non the floor somewhere on your skull [photo 8]. Again take a deep breath, exhale, and wait a\nmoment to give your throat a chance to, maybe, extend a little further.\n9. Return to center as slowly as possible, noticing all the differences that may be taking place.\nMaybe it will be easier coming back or more difficult. Observe whatever is happening. Try to use only\nthe amount of tension your neck needs for the movement.\n10. Stretch the back of your neck, elongating the back of your neck, especially the area at the\nbase of your skull [photo 10]. As you do this, your chin will come closer to your chest in a relaxed\nway. Try not to direct your energy to tensing and closing the front of your throat. Take a deep breath\nand exhale. How does your breath feel about this position?\n11. Return to center giving yourself a chance to observe the way you have released the tension that\nwas necessary to stretch the back of your neck. How do you feel about releasing the tension? Take\na deep breath and exhale.\nIf you have been working with the ball, gently take It away and allow your head to rest on\nthe floor. What is your neck feeling? How is the rest of your body responding?\n12. Lie quietly considering all that your body has communicated to you. Which of the movements\ndid you enjoy most? Were there any movements that you disliked, that felt uncomfortable, perhaps\nsurprised or pleased you? Give all levels of your perception some time to ask questions. Of course\nall of our history is known to our unconscious and with encouragement it may choose to make itself\nknown to our conscious mind; sometimes you may wish to take written or audiotaped notes.\n13. This action can be repeated changing the position of the ball. There are three or four places\nthat you can position the ball to support your neck: (1) the base of your neck; (2) just below your skull;\n(3) the middle of your neck; (4) the base of the neck, almost the top of your shoulders.",

    "Content": "Now I think that I don’t “make” dances anymore. They bubble up\nspontaneously from my cells, my unconscious. More often than not\nthese dances “make” me. Make me, show me, bring me to see things\ndifferently.\nJan 1989. Standing at the bus stop across the street from the Boston Food Co-op in\nAllston. Observing my mind’s wanderings and associations. My mind says to me, “Do I\nderive some strange pleasure from becoming anxious inside?” What the hey?! Where’s this\ncoming from? I grab a piece of scrap paper and scribble, trying to keep up with the liquid,\nelusive, thought words. Feels like channeling. I don’t know who or what. Try not to figure\nit out, trust it, let it come... Back home I edit, arrange, and eventually speak the words\nthrough a microphone onto cassette:\nDoes this give me some strange pleasure to become anxious inside? Does this\nenable me to feel my existence more acutely? Do I thrive? Do I take some strange\npleasure so that I can feel important like I am getting something, going somewhere?\nI build a crisis into my life—I fabricate a crisis out of what is simply living. I\njudge my every step, analyze my every move, in order to regulate, in order to know\nthat I am. Do I test myself constantly in order to know that I am? Do I derive\nsome strange pleasure from testing myself? Leaving any semblance of security or\nstability—leaving it all in order to risk some strange pleasure like I am getting in\nthe pit of my gut...\nMar 1990. Riding the Red Line train to teach morning Contact class at First Congregational\nChurch in Harvard Square. Another something coming through. When I get there I ask\nthe students to begin warming up while I write furiously for nearly ten minutes, to capture this\nbefore it slides away again. “She is restrained, she is restraint. You have to drag what she\nneeds from her with skyhooks...”\nMar 1991. Practicing Authentic Movement at Studio 440, Union Square, Somerville with\nJeanie Minuchin witnessing. In costume—full length/long sleeved/turtle necked/fake leopard\nskin/stretch nylon dress, grass green gloves. How does she want to move me? Quaking\nflapping shimmering shiver shift balance long reaching toe. “She attracts change. She\nworships change. Her restlessness, she wears it like a medallion...”\n\nApr 1991. She is a Canyon performed at Mobius in Boston, in a group concert produced\nI tell him, yes—me, too. Others adore her—yes, me, too! She is making herself known, my\nbody her vehicle. And of course I am her, also! Surprise!\nAug 1991. Practicing Authentic Movement at Studio 440 with Jeanie Minuchin witnessing.\nWall and floor my partners in a delicious contact trio. So much pleasure in moving—some\nstrange pleasure. Ah, I remember writing/speaking that text. Could this be the movement?\nI begin to risk feeling the full potential. Do I take some strange pleasure as /\nfabricate a crisis—my every step—my every move—constantly in order—testing\nsecurity—leaving stability—in order to risk feeling anxious in the pit of my gut—\nsome strange pleasure—so that / know that I am my ability to regulate my existence\nmore—being felt more—does this give me more, of what I can feel?\nNov 1991. Invited back to perform She is a Canyon at the Mobius “Art Rages” fund-raiser\nconcert. Each time out, “She” takes me to a new place, fills in another gap.\nFeb/Mar 1991. Moving to words of Some Strange Pleasure, practicing Authentic\nMovement at The Dance Complex in Central Square, Cambridge, with Sarah Hickler\nwitnessing. Up against a wall and Sarah says to me, “What if you were moving up against\nthe mirrors?” Yes! Reflected self—reflecting Self—self-reflections—reflected—reflecting on\nself-reflection!\nApr 1992. First showing of Some Strange Pleasure in faculty concert at The Dance\nComplex. I am wearing baggy rayon print pants, a white no-sleeve blouse, white socks and\nblack hard sole shoes—a real character. I am cold. I put on my jacket. Rose colored with\nwide lapels. Someone gives me a rose. I put it in my lapel. I go onstage and zoom!\nDo / thrive? Am I anxious? Do I analyze? Asking the questions—leaving any\nsemblance of security in order to risk feeling something. Do I judge? Do I seem to\nget something? Information about my existence—as I fabricate a crisis out of what\nis simply living. Does this give me something to feel more acutely—this crisis, this\nrisk of feeling the full potential? Does this anxious feeling in the pit of my gut—\nmove in order—test constantly—asking the questions—so that I can feel?\nJune 1992. Shared concert at Mobius with Sarah Hickler (DIG: Dance Theatre\nExcavations June 3-5). Performed Some Strange Pleasure some more. This dance is putting\nme in touch with the clown inside. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\nMy own anxious feeling—my every move—in order—to find information about what\nis—simply living—asking the questions about how I experience my acutely—my own\nability—risking—feeling—the full potential—of my own—strange—pleasure.\nJan 1993. Encouraged by a postcard from NSS and hoping to reconnect with the larger\nimprovisation and performance community I am sending these photos and texts and this\nchronology of solo dance evolution.

Also,\npossibly a focus (updated) on Contact\ncompanies around the world and how\nthey work.\nJeffrey Thornton, Albuquerque, NM\nSometimes I yearn, in my dancing isolation,\nfor some ideas about how to begin\ncreating dance community.\nErica Wheeler, Victoria, B.C.\nMaybe a profile on various teachers’\nphilosophies on Contact today, or profiles\nof practitioners, and applications\noutside Contact itself.\nScott Cunningham, Madison, WI\nAnything ever been done with the\nBreakthrough Dancing folks, integrating\npsychological issues and co-counseling\nwith Contact work? I’d like to see that.\nAlso various teaching issues like\n“should I/how can I/how much to teach\nlifts when some of my students are so\nobviously earthbound?” Seems to me\n\ntheir “issues” need to be worked on/re-\nsolved before “graduating” and yet they\nare clamoring for the teaching and I\nthen think maybe it’s a bootstrap thing\nand it’ll click in somehow? But some\nof them are a little lift-oriented (like orgasm-oriented\nsex y’know?) and I’d\nprefer to push through the rolling issues\nand the weight giving issues (like, how\ncan you be lifted if you can’t lie on\nsomeone?). That’s my biggest Contact\nquestion these days.\nWe don’t talk about difficulties\nmuch—even as simple as sharing ideas\nfor how to deal with that New Age\nstarry-eyed woman who insists on talking\nher way through class about the\n“universal energy flow” or what can I\ndo when (inevitably) my students burst\nout crying in the middle of class? I\nalready have a good sense but it would\nbe good to do some group thinking\nabout it. When to grin and bear it and\ntake it as part of the improv and when\nto respond/interfere if ever?\nActually this materializes more\nclearly as: When I’m teaching contact,\nis there a conflict between students’\ntrying to work out their psychological\nissues in class and my trying to facilitate\ntheir learning of the physical skills\nlike rolls or falls?? Make sense?'\nLori Shollenberger, Baltimore, MD\nSo let’s start a new column in “Still\nMoving” on Teaching Chops: exercises,\nconcepts, scores, and methods you’ve\ninvented, adapted, and/or particularly\nfind interesting!useful. Short one-item\nentries are perfectly acceptable. Who\nwill start? Send to us at CQ. [Eds.]",

    "Abstract": "This article recounts a powerful contact improvisation experience between Emery, who uses a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy, and Brigitte, a blindfolded dancer. Both narratives highlight the breakdown of perceived limitations and the discovery of shared humanity through movement and trust. The experience challenged preconceived notions about disability and fostered a deep sense of connection and equality.",
    "Content": "These writings were taken\nfrom the 1992 Breitenbush Jam\nJournal. The first story was told\nwith cerebral palsy, to Nancy\nStark Smith. The next entry in\nthe journal was a response from\nEmery’s blindfolded partner,\nBrigitte Jagg, a dancer from\nGermany, as told to Mary\nHerzog.\n\nEMERY’S STORY:\nI felt it at the “all-nighter” event\nat the 1992 Breitenbush Jam. I was\nin the room with one person. I was\nreally relaxed into the music and the\nother person was blindfolded. It was\nabout 3 am and she had been dancing\nall night really hard. She was really\ninto herself.\nI went over to her real slow,\npushing along in my manual wheelchair.\nI touched her with my foot. I\nfelt she didn’t know who it was.\nAfter awhile she made more contact\nand figured out who I was. I could\ntell she was very nervous, ’cause she\nwas shaking. .\nWe danced for awhile; she was\nmoving around my chair and I\nmoved with her, and after awhile we\ngot closer and she got really nervous.\nI invited her to come up onto my lap\non the chair and she went real slow.\nI felt her hesitating but she was open.\nShe got up on my lap and I took it\nreal slow, pushing the wheelchair\nwith my feet and holding her in a\nposition that felt safe for both of us.\nShe wasn’t afraid but I still felt she\nwas nervous. She still had the blindfold\non. It took a lot of trust.\nAt some point, she started making\ndifferent shapes on me and the\nchair. Every once in awhile I’d say,\n“I got you. Don’t worry, you’re\nsafe.” She was going up higher and\nhigher til she had her feet on my lap\nand stood up real slow, real tall.\nReal tall. She was shaking—she still\nhad her blindfold on. I had her real\nsafe and felt safe with her. At that\npoint, whatever nervousness she had\nin her melted away and we kept\ndancing.\nLater, she asked me for some\nwater and I took her on the chair\noutside the studio and found some\nwater on the counter and guided her\nto it. She was so relieved when she\ngot the water; since we left the studio\non the chair with her still blindfolded,\nI had all the power. I felt it was\nbig for her. Real big.\nOne more time it reminded me\nthat I was not disabled.\nAnd then we went back into the\nstudio and danced for another hour.\nHow was this first dance different\nthan other first dances?\nI was completely relaxed, like\nrubber. We were alone in the room.\nI remember the separate events. She\nwas blindfolded. Because all the\nfactors were so exaggerated it showed\nso clearly the transformation that\nhappens.\nWhat transforms and why? Is the\nphysical safety a major factor?\nI think it’s more the mental safety\nand some physical. To be with their\nfears of all sides of disability. To\nfeel and synchronize with my life,\nand how to find themselves in that,\nand to feel our common ground, that\nwe’re the same.\nThis experience has increased my\nability to recognize other people’s\nreality when they’re dancing with me\nfor the first time.\nI remember the song that was\nplaying when we first made contact.\nI think it was called “Come Sail\nAway With Me.” I can’t believe the\nluck and the coincidence of that\nsong. At the time, I never thought\nwhat it meant.\nBRIGITTE’S STORY:\nIt was, for me, the most important\ncontact dance I ever did, because\nI lost completely the feeling of time.\nThat was great. We danced for two\nhours and I didn’t realize it\nI was blindfolded and knew I was\nalone in the room and my body was\ntired, but the energy was flowing.\nSuddenly, I heard wheels on the floor\nand I touched a foot\nI was so curious. And I was nervous.\nI’d never danced with disabled\npeople before, and I didn’t know\nwhat was possible to do in a wheelchair.\nI moved really slow, which I\nnever do. I am a quick mover and\noften skip over points that are really\nimportant. This time I was slow and\nI could feel so much.\nIt was great that all my senses\nwere so open because I was blindfolded\nand after a short time I knew I\ncould completely trust this man. It\nbecame so easy for me to play with\nhim and his wheelchair. It was so\nmuch fun. It was so exciting when I\nstood up on his legs and when I was\nupside down and he rolled through\nthe room at a high speed, or so it\nfelt.\nAfter I had some water, we went\ninto the studio again and Emery’s\nmusic tape was playing. I liked very\nmuch to dance to his tape. I could\nfeel that he was singing the music in\na way. He sang the music with his\nvoice, with his body. And I was\nreally happy that I had my first dance\nwith him blindfolded, because that\nway I could really become close\nwithout fear.\nHe really had power when he\ngave me the water. I asked if it was\nreally water or something else. I was\njoking. I trusted him completely. I\nrealized that he could give me something\nelse, but I trusted him.\nAt the end when I opened my\neyes, the light was so much that it\nhurt a little. And I looked in Emery’s\nface and that moment made me\nhappy.\nLater, I couldn’t stop moving\nwhen I was lying in my bed. I am\nglad that this dance happened. I will\ntake it into my life.",

    "Title": "FROM CAMARGO TO CONTACT",
    "Authors": [
      "Leonard Pitt"
    ],
    "Abstract": "This article explores the historical and cultural context of dance, contrasting classical ballet's aspiration towards lightness and flight with Contact Improvisation. It argues that dance forms are not arbitrary but reflect societal values, using the example of ballet's emphasis on transcending the earthly, which mirrored a historical period marked by a separation of spirit and matter and a subjugation of nature.",
    "Content": "In the 1730s, prima ballerina\nMarie Camargo caused a scandal in the\nballet world by shortening her floor\nlength dress to just above the ankles.\nWhy the rash move? Because she had\njust invented the entrechats quatre and\nwanted everyone to see her hard-won\nvirtuosity.\nCamargo’s quick jumps in the air\nwere a radical departure for the ballet—a\nnew orientation towards the\nconquest of space, away from the older\nchoreography emphasizing the dancer’s\nhorizontal movement across the floor.\nFor the next hundred years, the history\nof dance can be seen as an ascending\ncurve lifting the dancer higher and\nhigher into the air. This unrelenting\ndrive to get the body off the ground\nfinally reached its culmination at the\nParis Opera in March 1832 with the\npremiere of La Sylphide, starring prima\nballerina, Marie Taglioni. Audiences\nwere stunned by Taglioni’s feathery\nlightness and gliding leaps where she\nappeared to come down only when she\nwanted to. The illusion of flight at last.\nThis raises the question: why the\nurge to get off the ground? Could the\nballet have just as easily developed an\naesthetic that emphasized the body’s\nconnection to the ground as it is, say, in\nthe dance of Japan or Indonesia? Was\nit an accident that the dance went up?\nI don’t think so. Dance forms are not\nrandom creations springing out of a\ncultural vacuum, but rather are fed and\nshaped by a whole set of social and\ncultural forces.\n\nCamargo’s entrechats quatre were\nan important contribution to a dance\nform that was in perfect keeping with\nthe thought of the period. In a similar\nway, Contact Improvisation is a perfect\nexpression of our own time. Let’s look\nfirst at the ballet and its historical context.\nhad spent over a thousand years perfecting\nthe duality of spirit and matter.\nNature was viewed with contempt, a\nworld of corruption and decay, the\nabode of the devil. God and his retinue\nof angels resided high above in the\nheavens, separate from nature. Salvation\ndepended on denial of the body. In\n1981 the church was still trying to drive\nhome this message when Pope John\nPaul II said that “the shame people feel\nabout their sexual organs helps them\nmaintain holiness and honor.”\nGod, the father, is above; mother\nnature is below. Implicit in this hierarchy\nof values is a rampant misogyny\nthat took on its most grotesque form\nduring the European witch hunts which\nlasted, at their most feverish pitch, a full\ntwo hundred years. At a time when\nbiological process itself was sinful, one\nof the most common accusations leveled\nagainst suspected witches was their indulgence\nin sex, eating, and dancing—\nphysical acts that the inquisitors distorted\nbeyond all proportion. The sex was\norgiastic, eating was gluttonous, the\ndancing was hysterical.\nLater in the 17th century, just as the\nwitch hunts were dying out, modem\nscience was on the rise with its new\ntwist on the cultural attitudes towards\nnature and women, namely that nature,\npersonified as female, was to be feared\nand ultimately controlled. Francis Bacon,\none of the architects of the new\nmechanical philosophy, stated that its\npurpose was to establish “The Dominion\nof Man over the Universe... to bind her\nto your service and make her your\nslave.” Bacon’s methodology for discovering\nthe “secrets still locked in\nNature’s bosom” was to “conquer and\nsubdue her, to shake her to her foundations...\nto storm and occupy her castles\nand strongholds.”\nThe scientist Robert Boyle looked\nupon nature as a “pregnant automaton”\nand deplored the “veneration, wherewith\nmen are imbued for nature,” for it has\n“been a discouraging impediment of\nman over the inferior creatures of God”\nJohn Evelyn commended Boyle for his\n“inquisition” of “stubborn matter” from\nwhich he was able to gain “a confession\nof all that lay in her most intimate recesses.”\nThese men and others with similar\nviews exerted a seminal influence on the\ndevelopment of the Scientific Revolution.\nNature was subjected to the cold\nshower of rationalism and came out\nnewly conceived—Nature as Machine.\nThe astronomer, Kepler, viewed the\nworld as a huge clockwork, a “celestial\nmachine.” Ren6 Descartes described a\nworld “composed like a machine of\nmatter.” The human body and all of its\nfunctions were reduced to the mechanical\naction of pumps, pulleys, and\nweights. The flight of dance from corporeality\nand the cultural need to gain\ndistance from nature were two aspects\nof the same historical trend.\nIt is significant that the formative\nstages of the ballet took place in the\ncourt of Louis XIV and that Louis wore\nhigh-heeled shoes. High heels, in fact,\nwere part of the ballet costume right up\nto Camargo’s time. Already the body\nwas being coaxed off the ground, reshaping\nthe posture in a subtle preparation\nfor toe dancing.\nIn the illusion of overcoming gravity,\nthe ballet confirmed the new science’s\npremise of man’s separation from\nnature. In its rejection of weight, mass,\nfriction and three dimensions, the ballet\nwas the perfect Christian dance—an\nabdication of the flesh. The ascension\nof the ballet was in perfect keeping with\nits time.\nNow let’s shoot forward to America\nin the late 1950s. As 17th century\nEurope was aching to get off the\nground, mid-20th century American\nyouth were fighting just as hard to get\nback on it.\nSuperficially everything appeared so\nsmooth in the 1950s. Automatic transmissions\nwere introduced and Dynaflow\nbecame a way of life. The purr of the\nautomobile was accompanied in song by\nthe velvet tones of the Four Freshmen.\nOn TV, Ozzie and Harriet and Father\nKnows Best were telling us everything\nwas alright. Just below the surface,\nthough, things were percolating.\nWhat do Elvis Presley, the hula\nhoop, and Chubby Checker’s Twist have\nin common? The lower body, specifically\nthe hips. Within the space of a\nfew short years these things hit America\nlike a tidal wave. Elvis the Pelvis\nawoke a flood of dormant hormones and\nsent young girls writhing and screaming.\nThe terrified TV censors lopped off\nElvis’s offending lower regions and\nonly showed him from the waist up.\nLife Magazine called the Twist an\nepidemic, a “hip-swinging mania,” and\ncompared it to the dancing madness of\nthe Middle Ages. And the hula hoop.\nThis wasn’t a toy, it was a phenomenon.\nAt the height of its popularity Wham-O\nCorporation was manufacturing twenty\nthousand hoops a day and couldn’t keep\nup with the demand. Suddenly millions\nof children around America were practicing\none of the most elemental movements\nof humankind, a rhythmic\nswinging of the hips. Here was a social\nrevolution waiting to happen.\nAt the same time, there was Limbo\ndancing, surfing, and skateboarding—\nmore ways for kids to think down.\nMost bizarre of all was a fad on Midwestern\ncollege campuses in 1959\nknown as “hunkerin’”—a slang update\nof squatting on the ground. Life Magazine\nran a story on the new craze with\nphotos of smiling students squatting on\nroof tops, in chairs, on pianos, in front\nof the TV.\nMainstream America’s reaction of\noutrage to Rock ’n’ Roll repeated an\nearlier eruption in the 1900s when white\nAmerica felt the shock of Ragtime\nmusic coming out of the African-Ameri-\ncan community and was never the same\nagain. The measured rhythms of the\nPolka, Galop, and the Waltz were\nshoved into the background as ballrooms\nacross the country hopped to the\nfaster rhythms of the Fox Trot, Bunny\nHug, Grizzly Bear, Lame Duck and\nChicken Scratch. Once again in the\n1950s, African-American culture, the\nmost marginalized segment of American\nsociety, was injecting American youth\nwith the pulsating rhythms of Rock ’n’\nRoll, and in the process unraveling\nsome of the most basic precepts of\nJudeo-Christianity.\nWhat was happening in America?\nWas there a thread tying all these things\ntogether? America’s center of gravity\nwas dropping fast, from the head to the\npelvis, and, sociologically, this was a\nkeg of dynamite with a short fuse. A\nradically new physical reality necessarily\nbrings with it a new world view.\nParents had no idea that as they encouraged\ntheir children with hula hoops and\nwatched them dance the Twist, little\nsocial rebels were in the making. Only\na few years later these same kids were\ninventing the sexual revolution, experimenting\nwith drugs, constructing the\necology movement, protesting the Vietnam\nwar, and exploring Eastern religions.\nIf an historical context gives an idea\nof why the ballet went up, why then\nwere we suddenly plunging back down\nto the earth? The only reasonable assumption\nis because we were too out of\nbalance. There was a message transmitted\nthroughout American culture in the\n’50s and ’60s. Be it the physical fitness\ncraze, natural foods, somatic-based\ntherapies, Earth Shoes, low riding tricycles,\nfutons, or water beds, the message\nwas the same: find the earth. The women’s\nmovement and the renewed interest\nin the ancient Goddess cultures are also\na part of this social history.\nAnd what about Contact Improvisation?\nAs the classical ballet expressed\nan urge to dissociate from nature, Contact\nreflects this deep cultural need to\nreconnect with the natural world. Nurtured\nlamps, and marijuana, Contact turns the\nclassical Western dance tradition inside\nout. The classical ballet focuses on up\nand out—‘up’, literally, and ‘out’, pre-\nsentationally. Contact, on the other\nhand, rejects the “show” and drives our\nattention back to the most basic elements\nof a body in motion. Weight,\ngravity, contact, and friction become the\n“stars” of what is in essence a performance\nof the body as nature. Years ago\nContact would have been formally censored\nas a form of Satanism, the dancers\nbranded social outcasts. Today it stands\nas a sign, one of many, indicating a direction\nto follow for our very survival.",
