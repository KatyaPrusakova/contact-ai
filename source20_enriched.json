This issue’s\nproduction has taken us from summer’s\nend and the first show of color\non the trees in Northern Vermont,\nthrough New England’s awesome\ndisplay, to the first delicate and daring\ndays of leaflessness.

    "Abstract": "This article, a reprint from a 1994 New York Times piece, introduces Contact Improvisation (CI) to a wider audience, highlighting its impact on modern dance. It describes CI as a revolutionary technique emphasizing touch, physicality, and improvisation, and notes its accessibility to both trained and untrained dancers. The article also traces the origins of CI to Steve Paxton and its influence on choreographers like Stephen Petronio and Trisha Brown.",
    "Content": "After twenty some-odd years of\nvirtual silence, The New York Times\nhas brought contact improvisation to\nour attention. We think this worthy of\nputting on the record What follows are\nexcerpts from the article named below,\nNew York Times, Sunday, June 19,\n1994. [Eds.]\nHis Dance Technique is Rooted\nin Chain Reaction (excerpts)\nTo the average person, the term\ncontact improvisation means little. But\nto a whole generation of choreographers\nand dancers, contact improvisation is\nakin to the gospel, a training technique\nthat has had enormous influence on their\napproach to movement and dance making.\nThe technique was invented in 1972\ndance, Steve Paxton. Just as\nKonstantin Stanislavsky created a system\nto help actors build their onstage\ncharacters by searching out the motivation\nof each moment, Mr. Paxton devised\na comparably revolutionary way\nfor dancers to develop movement skills\nmechanics of the body. At the age of\n55, he is much sought after as a teacher;\nhe is now teaching at the American\nDance Festival in Durham, N.C.\nContact improvisation is as distinct\nas the techniques of Merce Cunningham\nor Martha Graham, and like those, it is\ntaught all over the world by a cadre of\ndisciples. Elements of contact improvisation\nare readily apparent in the work\nof a number of modem dance choreographers,\nnotably Stephen Petronio, Elizabeth\nStreb and Susan Marshall.\nDescribed in its simplest fashion,\ncontact improvisation is the chain reaction\nthat occurs when, for example, one\ndancer’s arm or torso comes into contact\nwith another dancer’s back. It explores\na sensitivity to touch and celebrates\nfree-flowing physicality, deft reflexes\nand collision. It is movement that exists\nonly in the moment.\nMr. Petronio vividly remembers a\ncontact improvisation workshop taught\nat Hampshire College. “We did basic\npartnering things, like learning to share\nweight without killing each other,” Mr.\nPetronio recalls. “We also did meditative\nexercises, which were about letting\ngo of your muscles—a lot of standing\nstill...until your muscles got so tired\nthat you let go of them.... Other\npeople’s classes were about being told\nwhat to do all the time and getting a\ngood sweat going. Steve’s was anti-\nthat. It was not about mimicking steps\nbut about intuition.”\nThe principles of contact improvisation\nmay seem obvious. Yet like so\nmany developments in contemporary\nart, they became obvious only after Mr.\nPaxton’s years of experimentation,\nrepetition and reduction. When successful,\nthe effect can be playful, sexy\nand daredevilish, as dancers tumble\nagainst or roll off one another.\nUnlike other dance disciplines,\ncontact improvisation is not rigidly\ncodified and continues to evolve. Nor\ndoes one have to be a trained dancer to\nmaster it. “Contact is a way for people\nto start dancing,” says the choreographer\nTrisha Brown. “It is truly proletarian.”\nAlthough Mr. Paxton pioneered the\ntechnique, he says he does not feel any\nproprietary claim to it. “I didn’t really\ninvent anything,” he says. “I invented\na protocol for teaching it and tried to\nmake sure it was safe. Contact is essentially\nabout the same kind of energy\nthat exists in a handshake—that basic\nexchange of information in which each\nperson is extending his feelings but is\nalso receiving—and the balance of the\ngive-and-take of each person’s touch.”\nThroughout his career, Mr. Paxton\nhas been as elusive and free-spirited as\nthe movement technique he developed.\nIn 1961, at the age of 20, he joined the\nMerce Cunningham troupe and the\nfollowing year he was one of the founders\nof the Judson Dance Theater, an\ninformal collective of experimentalists\nwho redefined the parameters of choreography\nabout what makes a dance. Mr. Paxton’s\nearly works, for example, contained\na lot of walking.\n“I tried to produce a clean version\nof ordinariness on the stage,” he says.\n“Out of that reduction came so much\nphysical information.” A decade later,\nhe helped form Grand Union, the influential\nimprovisatory dance troupe. It\nwas while working with Grand Union\nthat he began solidifying his ideas about\ncontact improvisation....\n“The whole thing about this technique,”\nhe continued, “is how to get\nthings simple enough for the mind to\ngrasp. When I teach, I’m dealing very\ncarefully with the helix in the body,\nwith the hip sockets, with the shoulder\nblades, with extending down the length\nof the bone.”\nMartha Myers, dean of the American\nDance Festival school, believes that\ncontact improvisation is an essential\ncomponent of today’s dance curriculum.\n“Contact is as much a bread-and-butter\nclass as ballet,” she says. “Maybe for\ntoday’s dance it is possibly a more\nappropriate class.”\nOne reason Mr. Paxton agreed to\nteach at the festival this year is a certain\nindebtedness he feels toward the institution.\nIt was there, in the late 1950s as\na young gymnast and dance student\nfrom Arizona, that he first encountered\nDoris Humphrey, Martha Graham and,\nmost important, Merce Cunningham.\nMr. Cunningham showed the young\nstudent that movement could be approached\nconceptually, free of theatrical\nor psychological content.... He left the\nCunningham troupe in 1965 to pursue\nhis study of pedestrian movement.\nAfter Durham, Mr. Paxton plans to\nreturn to Vermont. There’s planting to\nbe done. “With any technique,” Mr.\nPaxton said, “you’re actually growing a\nnew body. You have to take care to do\nit slowly and properly. Just as there are\nrules in horticulture, we have them in\n‘humaculture’.”",

    "Abstract": "This article discusses the rise of improvisation festivals across North America and the author's mixed feelings about them. It explores the challenges of presenting improvisational dance within a festival format, including potential for misinterpretation and the need for audience education. The author questions the meaning of \"improvisation\" and its diverse applications in performance.",
    "Content": "Over the past year, improvisation\nfestivals have cropped up on two North\nAmerican coasts: The 2nd Annual Improvisation\nFestival/NY (New York\nCity), Seattle Festival of Alternative\nDance and Improvisation (WA), Improv\nFestival and Symposium (Vancouver,\nB.C.), Engaging the Imagination: A\nFestival of Improvisation (San Francisco,\nCA), and Taken by Surprise: Improvisation\nin Dance and Mind (Berkeley,\nCA).\nGlancing at these titles, one might\nnot know that dance was the subject of\ncelebration, or that the California events\nalso included theater, music and the\nspoken word. All the festivals offered\nperformances, teaching, and symposia/\ndiscussions. All added out-of-town\nartists into their local brew. In fact,\nmany of the same artists travelled from\ncoast to coast to participate in these\nevents. This showed some devotion, for\nthere was little or no money offered,\nperhaps because all but one of these\nfestivals were first-year ventures. As\nreported, the events were well-attended\nnotably absent.\nSomething is happening here. All of\nthese events were initiated and produced\nThis phenomenon provokes me. The\nfollowing impressions arise both from\nmy participation in the NY and Vancouver\nprojects and my experience out in\nthe field as an improvisational choreographer\nand performer for many years.\nWhen I was invited to participate in\nthe NY “Improvisation Festival” last\nDecember, my first thought was to\ndecline. Those two words together sent\nup a flare. A “festival?” At its worst,\na meat market, a fashion show. The\ntraditional format invites comparison,\nand work is often ungracefully juxtaposed.\nThe parading of artists in one\ndoor and out the other is particularly\ndifficult for artists whose work depends\non tuning into a space before performance.\nThere is simply no time for the\nart.\nAlthough the work of certain improvisational\nartists (myself included) has\nlong been presented in international\nfestivals of dance, it has most often\nbeen framed as exotic or “alternative”\nfare. One can well imagine why producers\nare wary of booking work that is\n“unpredictable” or “unrepeatable” in the\ncustomary way, but this reluctance has\nhelped keep both audience and press\nunderexposed to the development of\nimprovisational dance, and thus at a\nloss to appreciate its current sophistication.\nSo it’s high time for improvisational\ndancers themselves to begin a\ncampaign for education.\nI have become accustomed to expect\nvery little open-minded viewing of my\nwork by audience and critics alike on\nthose occasions when my work has\nbeen announced as improvisational,\neither in the advance publicity or in the\nprogram The great majority of audience\nfor dance seems to become instantly\npolarized by this labelling—aficionados\nexpecting “risk” and “spontaneity”\non the one side, traditionalists expecting\n“self-indulgence” and “the threat of\nparticipation” on the other. As I see it,\nnone of these expectations have pertinence\nto my own work. In light of this,\nI have as often chosen to omit any\nreference to improvisation as I have\nchosen to include explanation of it. So\nfar, neither approach has satisfied my\nneed for my work to be seen freshly—\nas dance, not methodology.\nA festival could be just the chance\nto broaden these expectations. But\nwhere do we start? I turn to the word\n“improvisation.” What has it come to\nmean? It is currently applied to an\nenormous range of approaches, methods,\npractices and performances. From\nloosely constructed scores for performers\nwith and/or without “dance” experience\n(requiring little rehearsal); to spontaneous\nor ad hoc performances by\nexperienced artists (whose work is\ncustomarily not improvisational) who\ntake the opportunity to taste a collaboration\nor try something out in the zing of\nthe public eye; to basically set movement\nchoreography leaving a few choices\nto the performers; to highly defined\nand rehearsed (sometimes over years)\nscores for movement, attention and\ninteraction; to the participatory, gravity\nand touch-focussed score of contact\nimprovisation, to describe but a few.\nContact improvisation itself brings\nup a related quandary. As the only\nimprovisational dance form to have\narisen from modem dance, and have a\nname of its own, Contact’s very appellation\nhas, in my experience, created a\nkind of unconscious moratorium on the\npublic’s awareness of and openness to\nother developments in the field of improvisational\ndance over the last 20\nyears. This has had some frustrating\nfall-out, with work as far-ranging as\nnon-improvisational video art, solo\nperformance, and duet dances with\nvirtually no physical contact, being\nassumed under its label. This part of\nthe prevailing confusion takes on absurd\nproportions. A festival of improvisation\nat this point in time might address this\nconfusion. A simple acknowledgement\nof the ranginess of its subject would be\na good place to start.\nIn expressing these thoughts to the\nNY festival organizers, Julie Carr and\nSondra Loring, I found them in an\nexploratory and inclusive frame of\nmind. As a result of their openness, I\nconstructed a way to approach some of\nthese concerns. I was joined in this\neffort by my collaborators in Image\nLab: improvisor/choreographers Karen\nNelson, KJ Holmes, and Scott Smith.\nFor our project, we set up a series\nof “Observatories” in a small theater on\nweekday afternoons as part of the festival.\nThe Observatories opened to the\npublic our practice of an improvisational\ncomposition score which applies our\nimprovisational skills to an investigation\nof the meaning of movement. It is a\ncollaborative learning form, both for\nourselves and an audience. It seeks as\nmuch to demystify an improvisational\nprocess as to preserve its mysteries.\nWe were grateful for its welcome in the\nfestival, the dialogue it stimulated, and\nits seeming relevance to the incredible\nvariety of participating artists. And it\nwas a relief for me to translate my\nconcerns into action.\nThe 2nd Annual NY Improvisation\nFestival was a two-week event, from\nNovember 28 to December 12, 1993. It\nsucceeded in spawning the 3rd Annual\nwhich will take place November 27 to\nDecember 11, 1994. It also planted a\nseed for the Improv Festival and Symposium\nin Vancouver, which happened\nthe first two weeks of August ’94 at the\nhome base of E.D.A.M. (Experimental\nDance and Music), directed by Peter\nBingham.\nPeter had participated in both annual\nNY festivals as part of the Contact\nGroup, an ad hoc collective of experienced\ncontactors interested in high-level\nexchange. With the input of Steve\nPaxton, Nancy Stark Smith and myself,\nhe constructed a residency project for\nworking improvisational groups to share\ntime daily in his beautiful studio theater\nat the Western Front Lodge. Two\ngroups participated: a smaller collection\nof the Contact Group, renamed Group\n6—Peter, Nancy, Chris Aiken, Jeff\nBliss, Julie Carr and Ray Chung; and\nImage Lab (which also included Nora\nHajos and Ray). Steve Paxton was\npresent briefly, and Simone Forti was in\nresidence to share her dance narrative\napproach with members from both\ngroups. Although the time was incredibly\nfull, most of us took the opportunity\nto visit each other’s work sessions,\nshare performances, and take each\nother’s classes which were offered to\nthe public each morning. In fact, all of\nthe work, to varying degrees, was open\nto the public. This was a brilliant stab\nat a new format for improvising artists—a\nworking festival.\nImmediately following the Vancouver\nevent, over half the participants\ntravelled down to Seattle to teach and\nperform at the festival there. From\nKaren Nelson’s telling, the main organizers,\nHeidi Drucker and Robert Harrison,\nhaving been informed about the\nVancouver gathering, had seized the\nopportunity to bring these out-of-town\nartists into the heart of their festival.\nAs Karen put it, “It was a great confluence\nof travelling dancers and local\nartists and a real shot in the arm for the\nalternative dance scene in Seattle.”\nIt is certainly possible that the appearance\nof so many festivals for improvisational\ndance in one year is coincidental,\nas artists in each area respond to\ntheir local conditions. It’s obvious,\nhowever, that the impetus for at least a\ncouple of these festivals came from the\nothers. Whatever the case, thanks to\nthis phenomenon, I’ve been stimulated\nto air some prickly questions about\nbeing part of, as well as out in, the\nfield.",

The festival aimed to foster dialogue and understanding around the uses, values, and cultural meanings of improvisation through performances, classes, jams, and public forums. Despite a lack of critical attention, the festival was well-attended and financially supported, successfully creating a space for the study and practice of improvisation in various forms.",
    "Content": "As per our initial press notes, our intentions were as follows:\n“We are interested in improvisation as a performance and art\nform, as a way of thinking and playing, and as a world view.\nWe believe that within the practice of improvisation lies a key\nto another way of being with one another, one that encourages\nspontaneity, challenge, discovery, and the expansion of creativity.\nWe are producing Engaging the Imagination: A Festival of\nImprovisation because we are interested in gathering together\nartists who have made a commitment to improvisation and the\nimproviser’s “mind” in their work. We seek to excavate and\nrender visible the skeleton, bones and muscles of our community\nand we want to create a space where the language of improvisation\nis spoken both fluently and well. We hope to engage\ndialogue about the uses, values and cultural meanings of\nimprovisation during this festival. Engaging the Imagination will\nbe a venue where improvisation can be seen, taught and\nexperienced. The questions of this festival circle around issues\nof faith and community: we believe that improvisation itself is\nan act of faith, and we are interested in joining with others who\nshare this view.”\n\n\nEngaging the Imagination: A\nFestival of Improvisation, took place in\nthe city of San Francisco from May 23\nto June 5, 1994. A two-week festival of\nperformances, classes, jams and public\nforums, Engaging was an opportunity\nfor dancers, musicians, spoken-word and\ntheatre artists to come together and\nshare their mutual, and dissimilar,\nconcerns and practices in improvisation.\nThe festival focused strongly on performance,\npresenting over twenty different\nartists in eight nights of performance.\nArtists from out of town, including\nDeborah Hay, Simone Ford, Jennifer\nMonson, Karen Nelson, Scott Smith and\nKJ Holmes joined Bay Area artists who\nincluded Ruth Zaporah, Jon Weaver,\nPulp Playhouse, Devorah Major, Maria\nSt. John, Nao Bustamante, Corey\nFischer and others. We tried to create a\nbalance of solo, duet, and group performances,\nbut soloists predominated.\nOut of town artists taught classes,\nperformed and participated in jams and\npublic forums. Classes were also offered\nclass in “Authentic Movement for Performance,”\nand something called “The\nAesthetics of Intimacy.” Anna Halprin\nled a community event attended by over\nseventy people. She shared her Earth\nRun score with us, and with her usual\ngrace and skill, taught participants parts\nof the RSVP Cycles, her process of\ncollective creativity. The festival was\nproduced by Jo Kreiter, Liz Ozol and\nmyself.\nThe festival was well-publicized\nbefore the fact, although no critics were\ncurious enough to come to any of the\nperformances. All of the events, including\n“Skeptics Corner,” an open discussion\nabout the nature, use and value of\nimprovised performance, were well-\nattended, both by members of the local\ndance community and others. Dance\nand writing jams were also well-attended.\nWe received all the grant money\nwe requested (!) and were able to pay\nthe artists and ourselves as organizers.\nOut of town artists were additionally\nsupported with money for their travel\nexpenses. We were pleased to be able\nto do that much and wished, as ever,\nthat we could have done more. Hotel\nTax/ Grants for the Arts, the Anne\nSchneider Trust and the Zellerbach\nFoundation were our financial supporters.\nIn addition, support was given by\nFootwork Dance Studio (through the\nefforts of Wayne Hazard, Michael Jones\nand Keith Corollo) and 848 Community\nSpace, which hosted the first week of\nperformances, where we were treated to\nthe usual support, discourse and challenge\nwe have come to expect from\nKeith Hennessy and Jess Curtis.\nIn organizing the festival, it was our\nintention to create a forum where improvisation\ncould be seen, studied and\npracticed. We were not interested in\ncreating a Contact festival, but rather, a\nbroader event where improvisation in its\nmany forms could be experienced. In\naddition, we were interested in the\nunderground structure of the improvisation\ncommunity, which our intuition\ntold us did in fact exist, although our\nexperience did not fully support our\nbelief.\nIn terms of engaging with artists\nfrom different parts of the community,\nwe hoped that inviting people from\noutside our immediate sphere would\nfacilitate this. All three of the organizers\nare white, female, Jewish, post-Jud-\nson contact-based dance improvisers\n(eclectic, but not diverse), and we wanted\na wider constituency in our presenting.\nLike most multicultural agendas\nthat are created without a sufficient\nnetwork to support them, our hope for\nengaging with people from outside our\nsphere in significant ways was not fully\nsuccessful. It is clear that a multicultural\nand multimedia agenda must also\nhave at its heart a multicultural marketing\nstrategy, which we did not have.\nOur assumption that inviting artists from\nother communities would necessarily\nbring in new audience was fallacious,\nand so our audiences, while ample, were\nfairly homogeneous. Questions about\nproducing outside our own sphere, and\nour need and desire for this kind of\nprogramming were many.\nIn addition, I feel we fell short of\nthe “study and practice” part of our\nagenda by focusing too heavily on performance,\nand the next Engaging will be\nmore educational than performative, if I\nhave anything to do with it. As an\norganizer, I felt obliged to attend each\nperformance, and although each one had\nmerit, the cumulative effect of eight\nperformances in two weeks has kept me\nout of the theatre for the four months\nsince the festival ended! Who knows\nhow long that will last... In its initial\nplanning stages, Engaging the Imagination\nwas called Educating the Imagination,\nand it was my desire to present\nmany teachings in improvisation. Due\nto the collaborative nature of this project\nand different interests on the part of the\norganizers, “Educating” became “Engaging”\nand education was superceded by\nperformance. Whether or not this was\na good choice is debatable and certainly\nsubjective.\nMany lessons were learned through\nthe creation of this festival. Jo and Liz\nand I spent many hours hammering out\nour differences and learning to work\nwith one another. In some ways, this\nwas our biggest learning: how to manage\nan event of this size and collaborate\nacross our differences.\nWe made some significant mistakes\nin the way in which we invited people\nto participate. This festival was a product\nof our own personal desires, not a\n“community event,” and not everyone\nwas invited to perform. We invited\npeople whose work was interesting to\nus. Although we announced the festival\nin the pages of this magazine, and\nspread the word as we went along, we\nwere met with challenges around the\nway in which we issued invitations.\nThere had been an assumption within\nthe Bay Area improvisation community\nthat the festival was “theirs” and would\nrepresent everyone’s work. We learned\na good deal, again, about the politics of\ninclusion and exclusion.\nNext time, I could see producing the\nfestival by asking for submissions,\nrather than relying only on our own\nlimited exposure as producers. This\nwould change the scope of the festival,\nand would be a big shift in its organization\nand purpose. Alternately, we may\nneed to be more clear about the ways in\nwhich we invite people to participate,\nand leam to weather the storms of emotion\nthat necessarily follow.\nI feel that Engaging the Imagination\nwas a worthy experiment. Friends were\nmade and old friends met again, and\nteaching and learning and dancing and\ntalking happened. In coordination with\nthe Talking Dance Project and the\nDance Critics Association events about\nimprovisation which followed our festival\nto have been reached regarding the\npresence and importance of improvisation\nin our lives. I look forward to\ncreating more events of this nature and\nwatching the process continue to unfold.\nAny questions, desires to participate,\nconcerns, etc., you can address to Engaging\nthe Imagination, 1074 Carolina\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 97107.",

Slowly move the head, allowing the vapor sphere to float within the\ncavern of the skull, moving in and out of the inner surfaces of the face and head. Leading\nwith the head, curving forward, slowly roll down through the spine, allowing the sphere to\nfloat down the hollow tube of the spine. Roll back up to vertical, floating the sphere to the\nlevel of the shoulders.\nLetting the body be moved by the action of the sphere, slowly float it out through the\nleft arm, all the way to the fingers. Bring it back, and send it slowly and with sensitivity\nthrough the column of the right arm. Now float it multidirectionally within the cavity of\nthe torso. Continue this process of allowing the body to be moved by the floating sphere,\nthis time moving it through the legs and the pelvis. Now allow your movement to expand\nin all directions, following the unpredictable and subtle flow and shift of the sphere.\nImagine the sphere as an internal shadow partner. Try adding a second sphere, perhaps of\na different color, density or temperature, and “juggle\" them internally, always letting the\nimage carry you into the movement.\n\nDay 3\nSitting in a comfortable, well-balanced position, gently open the eyes, including the third\neye. Allow the eyes to simply absorb what they see, without leaping out to grasp. No\nneed to name, catalogue and interpret each detail of the visual landscape. Allow your\neyes to receive, the focus to remain soft. Open and close the eyes, practicing this bare\nvision, receiving both the light and the dark with equal awareness.\nContinue to alternate between opening and closing the eyes, shifting your body's\nposition randomly and slowly, so that the visual field changes slightly with each opening\nand closing of the eyes. Get used to a receptive vision, releasing the natural aggressiveness\nand contraction of the eye-mind. Let the eyes become part of the big democracy of\nthe body's sensual experience, no more important than anything else. Imagine expanding\nyour inner vision, so that “seeing\" becomes a function of all the cells of the body.\nBreathe in, breathe out\nDay 4\nStand with eyes closed and feet close together, balancing the cups of the sit bones above\nthe cups of the heels. Breathe into the envelope of the skin, beginning with the surface of\nthe feet touching the floor, and extending to the soft palate of the crown of the head/ Feel\nthe whole body as a long, soft column of breath, from floor to ceiling. Imagine the sole of\nthe foot as a diaphragm, subtly responding to each breath. Feel your skin-body billowing\nout with the wind of each inbreath, and settling into stillness with each outbreath.\nNow lie down on the floor, and begin to move slowly, riding on this experience Of the\nbreath, travelling across the skin-map of the body. Experience your breathing as receptive\nand flexible; observing the uniqueness of each breath. Explore all the surfaces .of your\nbody: front, back, sides, top, bottom, listening to the movement of the breath through the\ncells, emptying and filling the pores of the skin. Alternate moving and stillness. Pause at\nvarious points in the landscape and allow your awareness to expand.\n\nDay 5\n\nUsing a surface that is soft and low (a low massage table, bed or even a pile of pillows),\nbegin testing the weight of the body. First let an arm or leg hang off the surface, feeling its\ninternal volume and outer form. Then try allowing all of one side or the other to fall and\nlengthen into gravity. Then let the torso hang, first lying face down, then face up, finding a\nbalance point which permits you to completely release into the hang without experiencing\ndiscomfort. Let the lower body hang, finding ways to support yourself so that the breath\ncan move freely through the inner cavities of the body. Begin to improvise a duet with this\nsurface, exploring all the ways in which you can use your bed-partner to suspend, hang,\nand lengthen. Be especially awake to the transitions from one position to the next, for\nthese are the places that hold the most possibility for discovery, where the dance is\nunpredictable.\nAs your body begins to have a deeper sense of length and volume, begin to explore the\ndifferences between an active, reaching stretch, and a passive, hanging one. Explore the\nprocess of going from active to passive and back again. Notice the sensation and the\ngradation of tension (a slow steady decrease or increase) when a muscle slowly engages or\nreleases. Slow down your movement to extend those moments even further, so that the\naccumulation or dissipation of muscular engagement becomes even more refined, and you\neliminate any “jumps\" or jerks, and are slipping almost imperceptibly from active to\npassive. Move just at the threshold of your sensory awareness.\nNow activate all the muscles at once, quickly changing position. Then release\ncompletely, but maintain a sense of readiness to move—as if the engine of the body is still\nrunning. Repeat these rapid shifts several times, each time changing position. Notice the\ndifferences that this dramatic speed change brings to your awareness and feeling.\n\nDay 6\nBegin by centering your weight on hands and knees, feeling the anchoring connection of\nthe knees upward into the hip sockets, and hands lengthening to the shoulders. Do not\nsag into the position, but be aware of a tensile strength and aliveness in this shape. Feel\nthe horizontal hollow column of the spine, from its atlanto-occipital cradle at the skull to\nthe end of the tail.\nSlowly rock forward and back between the head and the tail. To further activate the\nspine, create a clockwise circling motion with the pelvis which is echoed by a counterclockwise\ncircling in the head and upper torso. As the head reaches up to the right, the\nhips reach back and up to the left. Then head and hips drop through center, head moves\nup left, hips moving right, and so on. The head and hips describe circles in the vertical\nplane, and the spine circles like a jumprope between the two. Reverse the directions.\nFeel the head and tail actively reaching out into the space, seeking the far corners of the\ntwo circles. Add the movement of the eyes, making their reach the primary initiation for\nthe movement. Now initiate from the coccyx, letting the skull and eyes be pulled by the\nreach of the tail.\nCome back to center and fold the hips back and down, letting the sit bones rest on the\nheels and the forehead on the floor. Breathe through the hollow column spine, then slide\nthe hips laterally to the right or left to roll onto your back, lengthening and widening out\nthrough the arms and legs into an “X\" position. Enjoy the residue of the movement in your\nskin, your muscles, your bones.\n\nDay 7\nLie comfortably on one side, noticing all of the asymmetries, internal and external, of this\nposition. Beginning with any two points in the body, for example, the tail and the concave\nsocket of the closed right eye, start a slow-moving conversation between these two points.\nLetting yourself be moved by this dialogue, explore all the possible elements of conversing:\nquestion and answer, silence, listening, simultaneous speaking, leading and following.\nRather than sinking heavily into gravity, feel the floor as an active partner, and move\ntowards and away from it with a sense of dynamic tension between up and down,\nobserving the interaction of the body's surfaces with the floor surface. Include the whole\nbody, so that echoes of the principal conversation are “heard\" throughout the body's\ninterior spaces. Allow the inner and outer “landscape\" of the body to be transformed by\nthis dialogue, letting go of ideas about how your body looks, how your body usually\nmoves. Play with time, moving at the speed of grass growing, the speed of a star falling.\nObserve the stream of images and sensations that arise as you move. Let yourself be\nchanged. Generously allow the body to wander, to lose its orientation, while the attention\nremains clear and focused. Let the body decide.",

    "Abstract": "This article recounts a concert tour to Croatia and Serbia during wartime, organized by social activists to bring art and performance to communities and refugee camps. The author, a performer and teacher of improvisation, reflects on her anxieties about the trip and the potential impact of her work on a war-torn audience, highlighting the power of art to connect and offer solace in times of conflict.",
    "Content": "My friends, social activists Tova\nGreen and Fran Peavy had been to the\nformer Yugoslavia, specifically Croatia\nand Serbia, several times since the war\nbegan, each time bringing gifts and\nmedical supplies that they had gathered\nfrom American women. They\nmade many friends on these trips,\nparticularly members of local women's\norganizations working against the war\nand supplying aid to refugees. While\nthere, they asked their friends what\nthey would like them to bring on their\nnext visit. To their surprise the response\nwas: culture—art and performance.\nHence, they invited me and\nseven other women to join them in\nJune 1994 on a three-week tour, offering\nperformances and workshops\nthroughout the war-tom country.\nThe conditions of the world, at least\nas depicted by The New York Times\nevery morning generally had me overwhelmed.\nCustomarily I've maintained\na vague removal from international\nmisery, probably as a way of protecting\nmyself from my own sense of helplessness\nand rage. But events seemed to\nbe mounting and my guard, thinning.\nI was pausing more while reading,\nprojecting myself into the stories, identifying\nwith the victims and trying to\nfind myself in the persecutors. So\nwhen Fran called, there wasn't a\nmissed beat between her invitation and\nmy response. Yes, absolutely yes and\nthank you, thank you.\nThere were ten of us on the June\n'94 \"Honoring Loss/Celebrating Life\"\nconcert tour. Four performers: myself;\nRhiannon, a jazz vocalist; Barbara Bor-\ndon, a percussionist; and Naomi Newman,\nan actress with the Travelling\nJewish Theater. Two Muslim women\nfrom Malasia: Norma Nordin, a lighting\ndesigner and theater director; and\nZuriah Aljeffri, a painter. Penny\nRosenwasser, a stage manager and\ncommunity activist; Franceska Schifrin,\na painter; and Fran and Tova, the organizers.\nWe called ourselves \"Doves.\"\nWe were Jews, Christians, Muslims and\nBuddhists. We were happy with that\nmodel and felt it appropriate, since we\nwere heading into a war zone fueled\nOur itinerary included Zagreb,\nSplit, and Dubrovnik in Croatia, and\nBelgrade and Novi-Sad in Serbia, plus\na total of nine refugee camps that surrounded\nthese cities. The plan was to\ndo performances in theaters in the\ncities and workshops/performances in\nthe camps. Fran and Tova had made\nall the arrangements on their previous\nvisit\nEven though I trusted Fran and\nTova's judgment in including my work\non the bill, I experienced a subtle anxiety\nabout it Both the performances\nand the trainings that I do draw forth\ncontent that is somewhat unpredictable\nand possibly dark. This seems to suit\nthe tastes of educated American or\nEuropean audiences and students. I\ndidn't know about the Balkan countries—who\nwe'd run into there, whether\nthis work would translate.\nI improvise performances. Performing\nboth as actor and dancer, I\nweave images through movement,\nlanguage and vocalization. I enter the\nstage with no pre-arranged concepts. I\ncreate pieces by beginning with a spontaneous\naction. I then build a scenario\nstep by step until content is realized.\nWithin that process, I introduce characters,\nevents and situations that reflect\nthe mingling of imagination and personal\nexperience. The pieces are\ndreamlike, landscapes grounded in\nhumor and pathos.\nMy Action Theater trainings investigate\nand exercise various physical\nand mental processes of awareness.\nStudents look deeply at their perceptions,\nbehaviors and the possibilities\nfor skillful change.\nIn the weeks preceding the trip,\nthree fears loomed larger and larger in\nmy fantasies: (1) being captured and\ntortured by the Enemy; (2) doing movement\nwith women refugees, inadvertently\nopening them to deep pain and,\nthen, abruptly leaving without having\ntime to mend; (3) finding my improvi-\nsational work irrelevant and inappropriate\nfor a war-tom audience. I didn't\nwant to bring what I anticipated as my\nown despair and rage into their already\npressing lives nor did I want my\nhorror, dismay, and revulsion to\nshroud what I could otherwise offer\nthem.\nThe first fear turned out to be unfounded.\nI was never in physical danger\nin either Croatia or Serbia, or, if I\nwas, I didn't know it. Yes, there were\nsome tense moments. When our train\npassed across the Serbian border, the\npassport control officials were nasty\nand insulting and when we stood with\nthe Women in Black* in a main plaza\nin Belgrade holding up peace placards\non a Wednesday afternoon, there were\ngroups of military watching our every\nmove, and the lobby of our modest\nhotel in Belgrade seemed to be full of\nlurking shady characters with their\neyes steadily on us. Otherwise, as we\ntravelled from city to city we travelled\nfrom hand to hand, graciously and\nfastidiously hosted by local women's\norganizations. Everything was tidily\narranged. Even the State Department\nand the United Nations knew of our\nwhereabouts. For the most part, I felt,\nat least physically, safe.\nIn Zagreb, the first war city on our\nitinerary, it became clear that this tour\nwould require two different kinds of\nperformances. One for the refugee\ncamps and the other for the city theaters,\nwhich drew general audiences. In\nthe camps, we needed to work nonverbally,\nand when we did speak it\nwas with the aid of translators. In the\ncities, the people were somewhat educated\nin English, generally more cultured.\nLanguage, simply stated,\nworked.\nEvery camp was different and our\nvisits, unfortunately, were short, three\nto four hours. We'd usually arrive by\nbus and then be offered a tour. We'd\nalways decline, preferring to go directly\nto where we'd be working. We\ndidn't come to observe or gawk. We\ncame to offer our talents, meet people\nand listen. Each camp required a few\nmoments of scoping out. On the Dal-\nmation Coast, once a resort area, the\nrefugees were housed in damaged\nhotels. There was a sense of calm,\norderliness. People were nicely\ndressed, the children settled, contained.\nIn contrast, in the sprawling camps\noutside the cities of Split and Belgrade\nthere was commotion, disarray, the\nchildren chaotic. Some of the camps\nwere mostly women and children,\nothers mixed, with men and boys. The\nambiance would cue us as to how to\nproceed with an appropriate presentation.\nWe aimed to be simple and\nfriendly. For example, at a children's\nhospital I found myself singing and\ndancing \"You Put Your Right Foot\nIn...\" and \"Old MacDonald Had a\nFarm,\" a far cry from my practiced\nhaute-art fare.\nMy second fear also didn't apply.\nTeaching anything turned about to be\ninappropriate. What was fitting was\nplayful performing and interactive\nactivity. For example, I danced with a\nharmonica in my mouth, a language\neverybody understood. Seeing a mid-\ndle-aged woman prandng around with\na harmonica clenched between her\nteeth seemed to tickle everyone and, at\nleast for those moments, distract them\nfrom their boredom, apathy and despair.\nI drew those who were willing\nout onto the floor and we danced to\nthe harmonica together. There were\nalways some people unwilling to\ndance, dressed in black, obviously in\nmourning. But even they couldn't\nresist a smile, as delight and laughter\narose.\nEven though I had found, with the\nharmonica, a mode that translated, it\ntook me a few camp experiences to\ntruly find myself in the task. At first, I\nwas tense, off balance, focusing too\nmuch on the audience and how I was\naffecting them and what I wanted from\nthem—to make them feel better, be\nrelieved, forget war. But as I looked\ninto their faces, felt their warmth, hugs\nand smiles, and heard their heart-\nwrenching stories, I stopped objectifying\nthem. In a sense I let go of them\nand took hold of myself. I travelled\ninward, locating the deepest, strangest\nself, the self I love to play with.\nThe city performances were, in a\nsense, a bigger challenge. In each\nshow, I improvised three pieces, the\nfirst being a dance with either Rhian-\nnon singing and playing the piano, or\nwith Barbara drumming. I hadn't\nperformed just dance in many years,\nmy interest having been overtaken by\nintrinsically connected language and\nmovement But here, in this setting, I\nlonged for silence, for my body to\nmove with and through the horrendous\nexperiences that I was witnessing.\nDance came forward and moved itself,\none feeling transforming into another,\nhorror to humor, shame to power.\nEvery dance was different and I met\nmyself each time.\nThe second improvisation was the\nharmonica dance, light and playful. I\nwas usually up for it, having cleared\nmyself and paved the inner route with\nthe previous dance.\nIt was the third improvisation,\nwhich included the indelible concreteness\nof language, that was the crucible.\nIt presented a challenge I couldn't\nignore, not after all these years of practicing.\nSplit was the first \"war\" city we\nperformed in. I was tense. I was programmed\nto follow a slide show of\nFranceska's powerful Sarajevo war\npaintings accompanied by Barbara\ndrumming. I watched this event from\nbackstage and experienced myself\nshifting into a dark and somber place.\nI entered the stage denying these feelings,\nagain, as in the camps, trying to\nentertain, change the energy, lift the\nspirit. Maybe I did. However, the\nexperience wasn't satisfying. I worked\ntoo hard, didn't relax, didn't transcend\nmyself.\nIt wasn't until Dubrovnik that I\ndropped into myself. We were there a\nweek, got to know people, made\nfriends, felt the city, took up life there.\nThis exquisite city had been under\nattack for fifteen months. Our new\nfriends had lived through that and had\nhad loved ones die. They were fierce,\ndedicated, steamy, sophisticated and\nvery warm people. The refugees we\nmet in the camps nearby shared the\nsame fire and light. We laughed,\nshared stories, gifts and clothes and\nargued about the war. We were glad\nto know each other.\nWar was taking place ten kilometers\naway and yet these people were\nliving their lives as normally as possible.\nI was in awe of their strength and\nmy improvisations reflected that. Their\npower inspired my power, their grandness,\nmine. The content of the pieces\nshifted to themes of hopefulness, endurance,\nadaptability, and perseverance.\nI reflected their experience and\nwas grateful for the inspiration.\nBelgrade and Novi-Sad in Serbia\noffered yet another challenge. We\ndidn't know who our audience would\nbe, whether we would be aligned politically\nor not. I didn't know how direct\nmy material should be. Whether I\nshould say what I thought about their\nmilitary history and current violent\nabuses.\nAgain, this mental bantering was\nirrelevant. We stayed in Belgrade a\nweek. Yes, it was difficult The city,\nthe air, the faces, had a gloomy resignation.\nThere was little food. Americans\nwere hated. The general citizenry\nwas uninformed, indignant, nationalistic.\nIn the refugee camps we heard\nchilling stories about genocide, rape,\nmutilation, etc similar to those we\nheard in Croatia. Yet, in these camps\ntoo, there were smiles, hugs, playfulness,\ngifts and loving gestures.\nOur hosts in this aggressive, male-\ndominated culture, were wonderful,\nbrave, dedicated women, who put\nthemselves on the line daily by speaking\nout against their government's\nactivities. The people who came to our\nperformance knew that we were invited\nthey were either politically aligned or\ngovernment spies. The room was\npacked: energy—powerful, temperature—smotheringly\nhot, air—dankly\nhumid. I improvised my heart out,\ndanced with all the passion I could\nmuster, \"harmonica-ed\" my breath\naway, and, finally, spoke of accommodation:\nIn the valley there lived a group of\npeople. They stayed ■very dose\ntogether all the time. Breathed\ntogether. In and out. You could\nalways hear their collective breath\nno matter where you were. One\nday one of them noticed a light\ncoming from another valley. During\nthe night that person left.\nWith the dawn, there was a noticing.\nBreath stopped. Silence. But\nthen a baby gasped for air. And\nanother, and another. And soon\neveryone adjusted themselves to\nthe change and was breathing\nagain. Sometime later, another\nperson disappeared. Again breath\nstopped. Again accommodation.\nAgain breath. And this happened\nagain and again until the only\nthing the valley people knew how\nto do was to accommodate.\nThe reception was fantastic, overwhelming,\nboth to my piece and the\nwhole evening. A lot of gratitude that\nwe seemed to understand their situation,\ngrateful that we related directly to\ntheir experience without preaching, sermonizing,\ncondescending, or over-sympathizing.\nIn Novi-Sad, we were hosted and\nsponsored by the local office of an\ninternational peace and development\norganization, Soros. A young woman\nwho directs their cultural events met\nus. She described an event of the previous\nweek. A multi-national theater\nfestival had drawn a large audience.\nThe local television station showed up,\npresumably to film the event for broadcast\nAfter focusing for five minutes on\nthe production, the camera shifted to\nrecord the faces of everyone in the\naudience. (This is a government-run\nstation.) This obviously created a very\ntense situation. Consequently, she\ndidn't expect many people to turn out\nfor our event. And she was right\nOnly seventeen people came. Yet, I felt\ngraced by their presence, their willingness\nto risk comfort and maybe even\nfreedom. The improvisations reflected\nback their commitment to peace.\nThroughout the tour, I maintained\ncomposure. (I think having raised four\nchildren prepared me for anything.) I\nfunctioned clearly and fairly unemotionally.\nBut when I got home, I\ndropped into a state of depression and\ndespair that I've never known. I couldn't\nfind a way to hold my life here in\nCalifornia with what I knew of the\nsuffering and cruelty that was going on\nover there. I lost all semblance of hope\nfor any of us. It seemed justified that\nwe're ruining the planet and creating\nour own demise.\nA week after I returned, still wrestling\nwith the upheaval, I left for a two-\nweek residency at the Naropa Institute\nin Colorado. Groups of people would\ncome together as they did at home\n(family and friends) and want to hear\nabout the tour. What was war like?\nWhat did you see? I made several\nattempts at recounting the experience\nand each time it felt wrong, a severe\ndiminishment. The experience was not\nlimited to the facts of \"this happened\nand then this happened.\" It was only\nwhen I was on a panel about improvisation\nwith Nancy Stark Smith and\nRachel Rosenthal, that I, inadvertently,\nfound my voice. Rachel used the word\n\"sacred.\" That word blew me open.\nHow did sacred apply to war? Finally,\nthe accounting poured out of me with\nthe passion with which it originally\nentered. I learned that I had to be\nmoved to speak.\nThe following week I performed an\nimprovisation for the Naropa community.\nI knew that I wanted to make\nwork about what I had experienced\nbut I didn't have any idea how that\nwould happen. I entered the space\ngarbling language, and garbled and\ngarbled, travelling back to Croatia,\nSerbia, the Slavic people, my hotel\nrooms, the young boys going off to\nfight, murder, torture, crying women,\nangry women, mutilated men and\nwomen, my travelling mates, my loss\nof hope. In performance, I felt myself\nagain, and heard myself telling myself\nwhat the trip meant to me.\nThe tour was a great lesson about\nthe fullness of life. I touched the aspect\nof war that's about people struggling\nto smooth out their existence in\nthe face of miserable onslaught. I\nlearned that underneath despicable\npain and despair, the heart beats, loves\nand, given a moment's breath, hopes.",

    "Authors": [
      "Kate Tarlow Morgan"
    ],
    "Abstract": "This article explores the author's journey of rediscovering dance through teaching creative movement to children. Inspired by Paul Valery's concept of the \"Fourth Body\" and children's natural movement exploration, the author observes and learns from the children's techniques for creating and mapping dances, seeking to reignite their own creative process. The author aims to understand how children learn and express themselves through movement, hoping to apply these insights to their own dance practice.",
    "Content": "I am thinking of Paul Valery's\nessay on \"Aesthetics\"1 in which he\ntalks about the existence of three\nbodies.\nThe MY BODY is \"a thing that\nbelongs to us\"— arm that waves, leg\nthat walks, head that nods—or it is a\nthing that we belong to—a headache,\na wave of passion. The My Body\noccupies a \"strange, asymmetrical\nspace.\" My Body exists only in the\npresent; its universe is made up of\nimmediate moments.\nThen, there is SECOND BODY.\nThe one that others see; the one that\nconfronts us in the mirror. The Second\nBody has form, that which is\ndonned with armor, clothes, tattoos,\nhats, jewels. The Second Body\nmoves in the Outside World, the\nvisual world, as a surface; its universe\nis made up of images.\nTHIRD BODY, or the inside, can\nonly be perceived in pieces. It is the\nscience of fluids, sponges, vessels,\ntubes, fingers, articulated rods, tissue,\ncorpuscular shapes. Third Body\nis our dissection/inspection; its universe\nis the microscopic.\nAccording to Valery, however,\nthese three bodies are not sufficient\nin relaying the full body experience,\nand therefore he names a FOURTH\nBODY \"...which I might call the Real\nBody or equally well the Imaginary\nBody.\" The Fourth Body derives\nfrom the properties and events of the\nother Three Bodies and makes the\nunknown known. It \"pulverizes,\nmixes and rearranges.\" It makes\nsense out of nonsense and it creates.\nThe universe of the Fourth Body is\nthe universe of creation.\nI had been stuck for some time.\nAlmost three years, no dance. I\nwould go to the studio twice a week\nto contact my Fourth Body. I turned\nout the lights; I painted; I wrote; I\nslept; I cried—no dance. Then it was\nAutumn again. Time to go back to\nteaching creative movement to children.\nWhat was I going to teach, if I\ncouldn't move?\nI teach RhythmsR to children\n(ages 3 to 9) at Stevens Cooperative\nSchool in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nRhythmsR, founded by Ms. Ruth\nDoing in the 1920s, is a form of\nphysical education that has links to\nthe international physical culture\nmovement of the late nineteenth\ncentury—involving people such as\nFrancois Delsarte, Leo Kofler, and\nfimile Jaques-Dalcroze. I did\nRhythms twice a week as a child, as\ndid my mother. Today, we still\ndance with our teacher, Sylvia Miller,\none of Doing's original students.\nDesigned especially for children\nto move creatively to music in ways\nnatural to their development,\nRhythms is based on the premise\nthat every human being has their\nown inner rhythm. This is a useful\npremise on many levels, and fundamentally\nit's where I know the\nFourth Body lives. Or as Paul Klee\nwould call it—the 'unified diversity7\n{Sketchbooks, IV.43) of inner sensing\nand outer perceiving. Ah! the joy of\nmoving—I remember it! But how\nwas I ever going to recapture the\nmoving itself long enough to make\nsomething? Every path I took in\nmaking a phrase of movement\nwould disappear beneath my feet.\nThen I read something:\n\"When we are children, we discover\nourselves, we slowly discover the extent\nof our bodies, we express the particularity\nof our body through a series of efforts...\nWe twist ourselves around and\nwe find ourselves or rediscover ourselves,\nand we are surprised! We touch\na heel, grasp the right foot in the left\nhand, hold that cold foot in that warm\npalm... Now I know myself by heart.\nMy heart too. Bah! The whole earth is\nmarked off...\" [Paul Valery, Monsieur\nTeste, 1924]\nSo, the whole earth is being\nmarked off as we move. This\nseemed great. That is, not only are\nwe learning by moving—equilibrium,\ndexterity, even consciousness\nitself—we are also making our mark,\nwriting ourselves on the world,\nphysically.\nThis year, in my creative frustration,\nI made the secret agenda for\nmy teaching to observe (if not steal)\nthe techniques children use to make\nand map their dances.\n\nTHE 5/6s\nI was inspired by the five- and\nsix-year-olds' math project of pattern-\nmaking on paper and so, when they\ncame to Rhythms, I asked them to\ntry to make their patterns with their\nbodies in space. They went right to\nit, using the immediate sort of child-\ntalent that blends inspiration with\ntrial and error. Then came the problem\nof how to remember. We talked\nabout the patterns as dances and\nhow to capture movements by using\nother forms of expression such as\nwords and pictures. I brought out\nbig rolls of paper for the children to\nwork with and they made maps of\ntheir ideas.\nThe following week, when I\nasked the 5/6s to review their maps,\nthey became very disoriented. I\nrealized that the sheer act of mapping\na week ago had solidified the\ndances in their minds enough for\nthem to recall what they had done.\nWithout referring to their original\nmaps, they danced their dances with\nremarkably little variation. Then we\ndiscussed what it meant to rehearse\nand how repeating something helps\nyou remember it. I made sketches of\nthe children's dances for them to\nrefer to when they came to class. In\ntime these sketches were not needed.\nThe 5/6s worked for three solid\nmonths making dances with towels;\nthen they performed them.\n\nTHE 6/7s DANCE SCORES\nI became fascinated with the idea\nof remembering movement and wondered\nat what age the recording process\nwould move more easily between\na system of hieroglyphics and\nactual movement in space. My answer\ncame when the 6/7s needed to\nwork on a play they adapted from an\nAfrican tale, \"Who's In Rabbit's\nHouse/' which involves many species\nof jungle animals attending to\nthe problem of a rabbit not being\nable to get back into his house.\nI asked the children to choose an\nanimal, make up movements, and\nrecord them on paper. They went\nright to it. Each week (two months\nin the process) they would come to\nclass, ask for their \"scores,\" and\nreview and revise as they saw fit.\nThis seemed to be the age of moving\nand mapping.\nThere were several different\nrecording techniques: One, the spatial\nsequencing of a road map, indicated\nwith numbers, places, on a\nconnecting line. Two, the pictorial,\nless linear use of words and sketches\nto create a context as in a stage set.\nThree, the frame-by-frame technique\nwhere each movement was boxed\nand numbered as in a film or a comic\nstrip. And four, recording in\nsheer words as in directions for a\nplay.\n\nTHE 7/8s and 9s DANCE SCORES\nThe 7/8s and 9-year-olds took on the task of dancemaking and scoring\nwith verve. In terms of recording techniques, I noticed that the boys had\nrefined the frame-by-frame technique whereas the girls seemed to rely\nmore on straight language or words with drawings.\nThe 7/8s girls made dance-books in which the directions for the dance\nwere broken into phrases and set with a strong sense of design on the\npage. The 9-year-olds' Dances With Towels developed into a sophisticated\nrepertoire of solos, duets, and trios. They made use of their scores\nthroughout—as the dance evolved, so did the score——which engaged them\nin a double editing process in space and on paper.\n\nAnd so. I have the feeling I\ndidn't learn what I set out to learn.\nThis year, while I created the space\nfor children to make and map their\ndances, I stopped trying to dance\nand began to paint. Yet why do I\nfeel like I've been dancing? I am\nthinking it's because the paintings\nare maps. Big maps. With big thick\nstrokes on thick paper. Of bodies\nand subways and fish. Pictures\npainted with all my Four Bodies.\nWith the First Body, clumsy and\ndirect; with the Second Body, a limitless\nsurface of images; and with the\nThird, a getting in there and poking\naround. Finally, they are commanded\nitself. This is why, then, I feel like\nI've been dancing.\nAs Valery's says: \"...We twist\nourselves around and we find ourselves\nor rediscover ourselves and\nwe are surprised!... Now I know my\nheart.\" I hold to this, and will continue\nto hold my right foot in my left\nhand as I learn my dance.",

    "Abstract": "This article describes a creative movement and music project undertaken with first-grade students in response to a severe weather event. The teachers used the children's emotional reactions to the storm as a springboard for creating poetry, a sound orchestra, and improvisational dance. The project highlights the importance of flexibility and spontaneity in engaging children's creativity and addressing their anxieties through artistic expression.",
    "Content": "Flexibility and spontaneity must\nnever be forgotten when working on\ncreative projects with young children.\nOne Friday afternoon last year, a wild\nwind and rain storm occurred in New\nYork City. The children at The Town\nSchool were in their last period of the\nday: creative movement and music.\nThey were first graders, six and\nseven year olds to whom the events\noutside were overwhelming. Our\nschool is located right on the edge of\nthe East River. Cars on the FDR\nDrive, which borders the East River,\nwere being covered by water. The\nchildren were watching people being\nblown up and down the street. It had\nbeen difficult enough getting to school,\nbut the storm had gotten out of control.\nThe children spent a great deal\nof time worrying about how they\nwould get home and how they would\nmanage to traverse the floods.\nMy team teacher, Suzie Schwartz,\nand I sat the children down and decided\nthat we would discuss the events.\nWe formed a circle and began our\nconversation about wind. What words\ncould they use to describe the wind?\nSeveral children chose words like\nrevolting and hateful. Their fear was\nevident. Others offered pushing, pulling,\nblowing. We continued to create\na long list of words that described\ntheir feelings about the power of the\nwind. Class ended and we decided to\ncontinue this project for the next few\nweeks, basing our process on all of the\nnatural occurrences of the day.\n\nWhen the children returned the\nfollowing week, we decided to take the\nwords they had volunteered to describe\nthe wind and have them create a group\npoem. Each child presented a phrase\nof his or her own to describe the wind,\nand clever and thoughtful poetry was\nbom. Two very distinct poems were\ncreated by each of the first grade\nclasses.\nAfter the poems were completed,\nSuzie and I decided that we would\nhave the children create a wind sound\norchestra. We chose instruments that\nwould mimic sounds that could be\nassociated with the rain (bells, triangles,\nfinger cymbals), thunder (large\ncymbal, drums), wind (grates, shakers,\nwhistles).\nNext we divided the group in half.\nOne group became the orchestra,\nwhile the other group became the\nimprovisational dancers, moving with\nsome themes we had developed in\nclass. We enhanced the orchestral\nbackground by adding a sound effects\nrecording of thunder, wind and rain.\nThe children took turns participating\nin the orchestra as well as dancing.\nThe completed project began\nwith a reading of the poem followed\n\ndance and sound effects. The performance\nended with a second reading of\nthe poem.\nThe excitement and fun of an\nintense project that engaged the children\nfor three separate sessions, had\nbeen stimulated by the extraordinary\nnatural events of one day. We were\nthrilled by the results and fortunate to\nbe part of a creative teaching environment\nthat encourages and applauds\nspontaneity and flexibility.\n\n\n\nWIND by 1P\n\nWind, Wind the revolting Wind.\nThe Wind is cruel,\nThe Wind is scary,\nThe Wind, the Wind is pushing me.\nThe Wind, the Wind is lifting me.\nThe Wind, the Wind is pulling me.\nThe Wind is powerful.\nWind, Wind the revolting wind.\n\nWIND by 1K\n\nThe Wind swirls and whirls around,\nit can trip you and flip you and throw\nyou about,\nLike a merry-go-round.\nUmbrellas blowing up and up.\nThe Wind is very strong.\nIt can pick you up right off the ground.\nThe Wind can go from place to place,\nand pick up lots of water.\nIt can blow you,\nThe Wind seem s like an invisible ghost,\nThe Wind is all over the world.",

    "Content": "taking dance to the workplace in W. Australia\n\nWe are read as we move\nWe write as we move\nWe move and we mean\nmean to say\nmean to move\nMoving meanings\n\n\n\nIn Perth, Western Australia in\nMarch 1992, preparation began for a\nproject which would take dance to\noffice workers in the Federal public\nsector. The project involved dancer/\nchoreographers Alice Cummins and\nJanet Lee working with the Public\nSector Union. The project was part of\nthe Art in Working Life program\nwhich is supported by State and Federal\narts funding bodies to encourage\nartistic involvement in and representations\nof working life. My role was to\nrecord the project. My qualification\nwas both as a writer of fiction and as\nan ex-office worker. I understood the\noffice environment; in order to better\nunderstand the dance environment and\nprocess, I participated in the project.\nAlice and Janet were aware that\nthey would be breaking new ground\nand that all their skills would be required\nto bridge the gap between the\nworld of dance and the world of office\nwork.\nVarious discussion documents of\nthe Art in Working Life program had\ndemonstrated that dance as a cultural\nform was not well represented in the\nprogram. As in most other Western\ncountries, dance in Australia has generally\nnot deigned to waltz, pirouette\nor even hold out its hand to the everyday\nutilitarian world of work. This is\npartly due to the predominance of\nballet, which has led to the development\nof a dance culture dominated by\na concern with high aesthetic ideals,\nthe practice of which involves specialised\ntraining. Generally, it is a dance\nculture that is neither accessible nor\nmeaningful to a broad and varied\naudience with differing cultural and\nsocial values.\nIn the workplace, where the intention\nis to convey information, dance,\nas a non-verbal, non-linear art form, is\na less accessible medium than literature,\nsong and theatre. It is generally\neasier to disseminate information\nabout a range of issues of concern to\nworkers through spoken or written\nlanguage.\nThe development of this dance\nproject, therefore, depended on the\ndancers having an approach to dance\nwhich varied in many ways from the\npredominant traditions of dance in\nAustralia.\nThe dancers and their dance\nThe dancer/choreographers Alice\nCummins and Janet Lee both work in\nthe area loosely designated ‘post-modem\ndance’. Their work allowed for an\nequation to be reached between such\napparently diverse areas as office work\nand dance because, through their\n‘post-modem’ perspective, both activities\nare understood to articulate\nthrough the body. It is on this ground\nthat dance, with its potential for transformation\nand play, found its voice to\ncommunicate with workers in the\nFederal Government bureaucracy.\nThe participants\nParticipants in the workshops came\nfrom a range of jobs, such as working\ndirectly with the public (for example,\nanswering enquiries on the telephone\nand over the counter) and internal\nwork (such as operating computers\nand being in management positions).\nAll participants came from a wide\nrange of cultural backgrounds and all\nhad varying contact with the world of\ndance. Many had never attended\ndance classes or events. However,\nsome had participated in folkdancing\nor yoga. The participants attended ten\ntwo-hour workshops over a ten week\nperiod The workshops took place in\na dance studio as well as in the workplace.\nDance as work and work as\ndance\nThe major differences between the\ntwo worlds appeared to be between a\nmentally-orientated, rational, hierarchical,\nrule-and-regulation-based bureaucracy\nin which the individual becomes\nan officer occupying a rank, and a\nphysical, sensory-based, ‘creative’,\n‘artistic’, non-hierarchical world in\nwhich individuality appears to be\nhighly valued\nIt soon became clear that one of\nthe outcomes of the project would be\nto challenge many of these preconceived\nideas for the dancers as well as\nthe participants, for those taking part\ndirectly and indirectly.\nThe aim of the project\nThe objective of the workshops\nwas to provide the opportunity for\nparticipants to experience the process\nof ‘creativity’, a process which would\nallow them to physically embody then-\nimages, language and experiences.\nThe workshops offered the dancers\nan opportunity to reach outside the\noften closed environment of dance to\nboth learn and communicate. As\nanticipated, the workshops challenged\nboth the way the dancers taught and\nwhat they taught\nOne of the premises for the workshops\nwas that not only would participants\nbe dancing and learning about\nthe body (with all the potential this\nheld for improving the physical aspect\nof their working lives) but by working\nwith metaphors and images from then-\nworking lives, they could ‘literalise’\ntheir experiences and if desired, make\nchanges in them.\nFor example, in an exercise that\ninvolved working with a familiar object\nsuch as a telephone, pen or keyboard,\nor retracing their journeys to\nwork, the participants would simplify\nthese movements and work with their\n‘physical essence’. The exploration of\nthese movements led to an awareness\nof the body in the work environment\nThe following section tells of both\nthe practicalities and the poetics of\nwhat emerged from the workshops for\nthe participants and the dancers. “The\nWorkshop” describes the workshop\nprocess and the practical benefits that\nthe participants experienced. “The\nBody Works Another Day” is my\nresponse to the in-house dance Crossing\nthe Floor with Intent, created and\nperformed by Alice and Janet especially\nfor the participants at the end of the\nworkshop. The sound composition for\nthe piece was created by Rob Muir.\nThe performance served to represent\nthe work that the participants had\ndeveloped during the workshops so\nthat they could witness their working\nlives from a movement and dance\nperspective. In this way, the performance\nfulfilled one of the project’s\nmain objectives which was to facilitate\nan exchange between the working lives\nof dancers/artists and office workers.\n\nTHE WORKSHOP\n\nAlignment work\nThe first hour of each workshop was\nspent on alignment work. The dancers\nchose alignment work to put participants\nin touch with their senses, their bodies,\nand their imaginations.\nEach week the participants addressed\na different skeletal and muscular part of\nthe body, such as the foot, the pelvis,\nthe arm. The first week, for example,\ninvolved articulation of the head. Both\nin terms of the type of work they normally\ndid and the hierarchical situation\nin which they functioned, the participants\ncame to the workshops with the\nsense of being, as one participant put it,\n“top-heavy.” The alignment work was followed\n(rolling, crawling, walking, etc.) in\nwhich participants explored a gradually\nacquired series of movements. This\nmovement sequence was practiced as a\ngroup with each person working/moving\nin their own time, while maintaining a\nsense of the others. Moving like this\ninvolved the subtle introduction of\nperipheral vision. The sequence led the\nparticipants to be able to change levels\neasily and fluidly between movements\nsuch as rolling, crawling, walking and\nfolding. With this preparation, they\nwere able to move with ease from the\nalignment work to the more full-bodied,\nimprovisational dance activity.\nDancing the ‘everyday’\nThe second half of each workshop\ninvolved exploration and structured\nimprovisations. In one exercise, the\nparticipants recreated in the studio the\nsteps they took each day from the entrance\nof their workplace to their particular\nwork position. There was much\nhumour as the participants dodged each\nother along imaginary corridors, into\nelevators, in and out of the tea room,\ntaking imaginary stairs two at a time.\nIn the coming weeks they would refine,\nexaggerate, and play with their journeys,\nas choreographers.\nIn another exercise, each participant\nwas asked to consider what personal\ngestures they typically had. Some\nscratched their heads saying they didn’t\nhave any! Others recognised that they\nhad habits such as constantly pushing\ntheir glasses over the bridge of their\nnose, rubbing the back of their neck,\npulling at a tie, fidgeting with clothing.\nEventually these idiosyncrasies would\nbe added to their dance vocabulary, like\nspice to a cooking pot.\nTwo men walk towards each\nother passing closely, narrowly\nmissing. A woman and man\nwalk towards each other. They\nstop, he fingers his earlobe, she\nadjusts her glasses. They move\non. He stops, I stop, we look, I\nrub my neck, I wince, he laughs\nand rubs his chin. We move on.\nDance as process rather than performance,\nwas particularly appropriate\nfor a project involving people working\nwithin a bureaucratic structure where\nworkers receive and send, and enact\nonly a part of the whole. Working with\nprocess was also signficant for the\ndancers. The process involved a variety\nof stages from attending meetings in the\nworkplace to providing a space for\nrelaxation and innovation. It was important\nfor the dancers because it allowed\na relationship to be developed\nbetween them and the participants. On\nthis basis, an exchange of social and\ncultural ideas about movement, dance\nand the body in the context of the\nworkplace could begin to develop.\nThe workshops emphasised multiplicity\nof movement. The body was\nfocussed on as it changed in different\nenvironments and situations, as it\nmoved from an entrance to a place of\nrest, from the workplace to the home,\nfrom the kitchen to the garden, from the\noffice to the basketball court\nSometimes the participants were\nguided by the dancers with an image,\nsometimes by a question. What do you\ndo, which way do you go, is it like this\nlater in the day, earlier in the day?\nHow do we trace the present?\nHe swings his arms energetically,\ndivesting himself of his\ncoat and scarf, spinning into his\nchair and reaching for the telephone.\nNow the movement is\nrepeated, the movement flows,\nnow a teetering body, windmilling\narms, swirls to the ground.\nThe workshops used imagination\nand improvisation as a way to transform\nmental or sensory experience into bodily\nexpression. Aids to the imagination\nwere used such as moving while wearing\nan item of work clothing. This\ndrew attention to the differences inherent\nin various locales such as work,\nhome, places of leisure. Wearing an\narticle of clothing such as a tie, a shoe,\nallowed participants to play with their\n« own image as an image, thereby gaining\na new perspective on the multiplicity\nof images that we come to know as\n‘the self’.\nThe dancers worked with participants\nto physically embody such abstract\nnotions as pressure, fear, co-operation,\nisolation, hierarchy. In this way\nthey were able to address some of the\nstresses, strains and pleasures of work in\nan office environment.\n\nBenefits in the workplace\n\nThe issue of ‘creativity’ in the\nworkplace is no lightweight matter (to\nuse a nicely embodied metaphor). The\nkey to success in any organisation is\noften the imaginative worker who can\nsee beyond what is given, take a calculated\nrisk, initiate an innovative\napproach; someone not bound by what\nhas gone before.\nIt is partly to encourage innovative\nmanagers that modem management\nprograms in both the public and private\nsectors use activities such as\ncaving, abseiling, rock climbing, to\ndevelop the skills of quick, innovative,\nlateral thinking as well as team building\nand leadership qualities.\nA participant in one of the studio\nworkshops was a senior training consultant\nHe offered these observations:\n“Many management programs are\ndesigned to enhance managers’ capacity\nto manage risks. This frequently\ninvolves experiencing events that\n‘push’ the individual to the edge of\ntheir comfort zone. Abseiling is often\nused for such training. In my opinion\nthese dance workshops were more\nchallenging than jumping off any\ncliff... The workshops provided each\nparticipant with additional experiences\nand practice at managing personal\nrisk at some level...\n“Potential tangible benefits include:\nincreased performance due to\nimproved stress management capacity;\nreduced likelihood of occupational\noveruse syndrome because of improved\nphysical awareness; increased efficiency\ndue to quicker decision making due\nto enlivened creative thinking processes;\nand more effective work performance\ndue to enhanced sense of well\nbeing...\n“Movement and dance specialists\nhave so very much to share with other\nworkers. The human being is in a\nstate of near constant movement. To\nbe able to treat or view this movement\nas a dance, and to be able to choreograph\nyour own dance in your day-to-\nday life is an act of tremendous empowerment.\nTo help people see this\nviewpoint can be of great value.”\nA female office manager (a friend\nnot involved in the workshops) framed\nthese views in another way. She had\nrecently returned from a management\nexercise which involved being lowered\ninto a deep cave with four others, one\ntorch between them, and memorised\ninstructions as to how to find their\nway out She explained:\n“...One of the greatest problems\nexperienced by senior women in management\nis having to work in a predominantly\nmale environment. The\nchallenge of this, for both men and\nwomen, is of course never addressed\nor acknowledged in these terms. Consequently\nI am thrown into a training\nexercise based on masculine notions of\nphysical challenge and expected to\ncope. Perhaps with the so-called\nfeminisation of the workplace’, the\nidea of what constitutes a challenge\nshould be addressed. Perhaps, dance\nworkshops and other such exercises in\nwhich men move in a traditional female’\nspace would provide men in\nparticular with the opportunity to address\nsome of their social conditioning.”\nOne of the potential benefits of\nbringing office work together with\ndance is improved physical and personal\nhealth. The attention a dancer\npays to her body is an essential skill\nand a constant factor. The occupational\nhealth hazards of the typical\noffice workplace include eye strain,\nheadaches, occupational overuse syndrome,\ntense shoulder muscles, neck\nand stomach tension and many other\nailments. Although ergonomic furniture\nand subdued lighting of the best\noffice environments shows increasing\nawareness of occupational health issues,\nattention and care is still required\nAs participants learned to engage\nphysically and ‘play’, they began to\nexperience changes on a personal\nlevel:\n“I saw how supple the performers\nwere and decided it’s not too late to\nchange. The workshops made me\nmore aware of how I move. I am now\nmore aware of the physical body in\nthe home and the work environment. “\n[female administrator]\n“We learned more about how our\nlimbs and bodies move. I personally\ndeveloped a greater awareness of my\nphysical self which carries over to the\npresent... It was a significant learning\nexperience to rediscover a ‘sense\nof wonder’ that can be associated with\nthe smallest most subtle movement.”\n[male training consultant]\nThe benefits of the project were\nphysical and intellectual, personal and\npublic. The worlds of dance and work\nhad met and a productive exchange\nhad occurred. The dancers had\nachieved a greater understanding of\noffice work culture and an enriched\nvocabulary of movement, and the\nparticipants expressed clear satisfaction\nin the unusual journey they had\nchosen to embark on.\n\nTHE BODY WORKS ANOTHER DAY\n\na response to Crossing the Floor with Intent,\na dance by Alice Cummins and Janet Lee\nCrackle thin/thick noise. A car revs.\nShe saunters, she walks then falling she,\nthey fall into space. Rolling the body to\ncomputer rhythms, birds chirping. Bodies\npropelled forward, ‘ifs a regular\njob’, rolling one after another, ‘you can\nsay that for it’. Awkward body, zip-\npered buttoned and clasped, adjust the\nclothing. At odds, with and not yet\nwith. Hear the tiny tiny pin squeak\nrhythms, hardly a rhythm at all. Silence.\nThe clatter of people with people. The\nspace opens to chatter recorded at full\nvolume, it's like the release of a thousand\npigeons. The dancers walk. They\nmeet, they dance a jig. Phones ring in\nthe silence. They move apart each\nbalancing the movement of the other.\nTwo halves make a whole. Springing\nsteps, places to go people to see.\nShe sits. She keys, she plays the keys.\nShe sits, she is the seat, she is the keys.\nThe bell pings, she reaches the end of\nthe line, the end, the very full stop. She\nswivels, she turns, down the water gurgles.\nDown she falls rolling backward\nover the other’s body, the body becomes\nthe seat. Let’s do it. One more time.\nThe keys tap tap. The lazy brown dog\njumps over the something fox. The\nchair sighs her into place. Leaping to\ntheir feet they call out. Got to make it\nhappen. ‘Lisa, Ian, Shirley’, they run\nfrom one to another passing on the\nmessage, things to do to do to do.\nStamp me press me determine me.\nDocuments will be filled in, sign on the\ndotted line.\nThe body expands, edges fill and overflow,\nthe singer croons me baby, baby.\nOff she goes on maternity leave. It’s\nmore than she bargained for and who\ndid the bargaining? First break, ha ha,\nin seventeen years ha ha. She takes\ncentre stage, she cradles the phone.\nThe tennis balls flip to and fro. Ping\npong, she rolls into the half-court.\nPing pong, she rolls under the net, she\nis no champion, just a born survivor.\nArms swivel in their sockets, swiveling\nhip joints, her foot glides forward as\nshe pulls herself through another day.\nAgainst the far wall another watches,\nsuspended, only her head moving to and\nfro on a musical merry-go-round. She\ncurves her body, she’s a lion-tamer, a\nbareback rider, she has a lasso. She is\nriding on the a bus, a bus to work.\n\nGraceful birds float and leap. Someone\nhas given instructions, how to be graceful,\nhow to float, how to leap, how to\nbe. Learning curves can bend and bow\na body. Folding. Rolling. Sitting.\nSimon says, do what I do and I do.\nBalancing. On a foot, on a toe, on a\npoint, it’s a mute point. Turning, the\nsound is turning, I hear a sound turning\nand see a body turn. I watch.\nJust checking, keeping you in check.\nShe balances on the back of the other.\nA foot against a neck, a hip against a\nthigh. She sits, cupped in the thighs of\nanother. You support me, I will climb\nyou, I will support you, you will climb\nme.\nIt’s a crossing times five, Monday to\nFriday and all that. Some cross seven\ntimes. And here it comes again, watch\nthe space, mark your trail. This is your\nlife. Lift a foot, place it, straight leg,\nbent leg. Eyes front. She steps, all is\nsure. 'When push comes to shove and\nyou don’t know, you can’t know, can\nyou?’ Will she ever get up off the\nfloor? Hear the latest, so and so, said\nthey’re falling like flies. Stay on track,\nplaces to go. Blown by the wind. We\nare here to help. At your service. It all\ndepends. With your assistance. Yours\nsincerely. I’m out of here.\nShe keys in her sleep, keys, whisks and\nbeats. She’d rather be whisked than\nbeaten. The beater shapes the bowl, the\npen sways over its white terrain, her\nfeet mark the ground on which she\nwalks, she’s come a long way and the\nbeater shapes and the pen sways and\nthe body shapes, the body sways and\nthe body works another day.",

    "Content": "Michelle Distel, Jay Knapp\n\n\nCURRENT, a performance by\nvisual artist Bill Botzow, dancers Meg\nCottam and Michelle Distel, and musi-\ncian/composer jay Knapp, is a working\nexamination of the way people work.\nTwo of the four artists are a recently\nmarried couple; the two others are\nfriends, both married, one pregnant\nthroughout the process. They vary in\nage from mid-20s to mid-40s. As director\nof No. B.I.A.S. (North Bennington\nIndependent Artists' Space) in Vermont,\nthe gallery where Current was performed,\nlocated directly above their rehearsal\nspace, I had the unique opportunity\nto observe the group's process.\nThe four artists began by agreeing on\na format in which to work. They decided\nto meet twice a week; the dancers\ndanced, the musician improvised on the\nsaxophone, the visual artist did action\ndrawings (my term) on large pieces of\npaper. He did one each session. All\ndrawings made during the rehearsals/\nperformances were present at the sessions,\nthe new drawing added to the\ngrouping each time. These drawings\nbecame a symbol of their work together,\nthe only tangible artifacts of the sessions.\nTheir accumulation represented time,\nwork and progress.\nThe process was one of, what I call,\nknowledgeable interaction. Each time,\nthey got together and played, like a jazz\ngroup might. However, it was not what\nI would call strictly improvisational—\nthey talked too much for that, reflecting\nand shaping as they went along.\nThe challenging part for all of them\nwas the collaboration. It was a collaboration\nin an unusual sense because,\nalthough they interacted, the emphasis\nwas on their individual activities, which\ncombined, filled, and created spaces.\nThey worked with no other scores than\nthe agreement of times to meet, and the\nenvironment created by Bill's large sectional\ndrawings. These drawings later\nbecame part of his installation of draw-\nx ing, painting and sculpture that occupied\ni the gallery as an autonomous exhibition\n* and created the physical and visual\nstaging for the performances.\nThe artists' various life-styles also\ndictated the work in terms of their differing\nschedules and obligations outside the\nwork. They came into conflict regarding\nthe working process fairly regularly,\nwhich was as fruitful for and telling\nabout their project as anything else. For\nme, their project was a humanistic one\nof how people work and live together.\nTheir endeavor became symbolic of\ntrying to to posit an autonomous individual\nin a cohesive society. In the end,\ntheir efforts proved successful in terms of\nprogressing their individual aesthetic\nlanguages and creating a group dynamic\nwhere the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts. The stronger their personal\nlanguages and idioms became, the\nstronger the group performance became,\nillustrating an interesting paradigm.\nIt was also a kind of dramaturgical\nmetaphor (“all the world's a stage\"), in\nwhich the performers played the roles of\nthemselves. This was valuable to the\nartists' understanding of themselves, and\ninteresting to the audience in its theatrical\npresentation of the artists as themselves;\nit struck a funny chord. Current\nis an innovative kind of theater, which\nfor me evokes, among other notions, the\nrealization that we play so many concurrent\nroles in our lives (workers, bosses,\nmothers, lovers, spouses, civic members,\nand guardians) that all we have to\ndo to observe theater is become conscious\nof ourselves and the people we\nlive and work with.\nFor the artists, Current was partially\na study of organic movement—of\nchange. This work-in-progress will\nalways be such; its structure provides it\nwith no place to land, like our lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drawings, paintings and sculpture in the exhibition are the outgrowth\nof several years of observing and drawing water in local streams and\nrivers.\nI make the drawings by layering black, white and colored chalk on a\nwatercolor ground. Each piece is comprised of twelve to twenty units done\none after another. As each segment is completed it is pushpinned to the wall\nadjacent to another until a square or rectangular block is achieved. The\nconnecting lines are sometimes accidental, sometimes not\nI make the sculptures from dead and down wood. First I debark, cut,\nand drill branches and saplings and then I reassemble the parts into flexible\nstructures. Originally, these pieces were floated to interact with currents and\nthus reveal water's motion. I also hang them from tree limbs to move in the\nair. More recently, I've been combining them with the big drawings. Like\ntheir initial subject, water, the various parts can be considered separately or\ntogether.\nThe paintings are the most recent invention. They continue the processes\nestablished in the drawings. Here, a rough, multicolored ground is partially\ncovered with freely painted black and white oil paint, then parallel surface\nlines are dropped through the paint film.\n\nBill Botzow\n\n\nAt the onset we had inordinately little\nconversation or instruction as to the\nform the process and the product would\ntake. Our main score, so to speak, was\nto have no score. In considering form\nas information, to choose to work with\nlittle or no form would be to take uninformed\naction. Being that we had no\ndirections, no score, no format, we\naccessed the part of ourselves which\nenables one to intuit or create a situation\nwithout a plan or blueprints. Our\nintuition created our form. W e gained\ninformation from our experience as\nopposed to needing information to have\nan experience. It seems to me that our\nprescribed demands were for the most\npart on ourselves. Each of us composes\nas we see fit, (with our presence as well\nas our absence) contributing our part or\nelement to the collective. Within each\nof us, I believe our intuition is relied\nupon to create our form, our process\nand our products.\n\nJay Knapp\nmusician\n\n\nFor me, a session often proceeds this\nway:\nI enter the work space with greetings\nand small talk to my partners. After\nhanging up my coat I take the completed\ndrawings from each of the previous\nsessions and lay them on the floor. Then\nI take graphite, a folded fresh sheet of\npaper, my drawing board, and begin\nmaking instant marks in response to\nwhat I notice. The dancers' stances,\nmotions and rhythms, the musician's\nsound, the marks on my page or the\nsounds from the next room may engage\nmy attention. Sometimes I draw with my\neyes closed or my left hand. When the\ninitial folded sheet is partially filled I turn\nit over and continue. I usually move\naround the room a few times in a session,\nsometimes coming quite close to\nmy partners, sometimes withdrawing to\nthe edges. I am a participating observer.\nWhen the next portion of the sheet is\nalso partially completed, I unfold and\nrefold the page and continue working.\nEventually, all the parts become linked.\nAt some point between forty minutes and\nan hour we arrive at closure. Then I add\nthe completed sheet to the previous\ndrawings. We take some time to reflect\non the session and make any necessary\narrangements. I retrieve the drawings,\ngather up my belongings and depart.\n\nBill Botzow\nvisual artist\n\n\nWe (Bill, Meg, Michelle and Jay) have\nbeen meeting and working together for\nsome weeks. Originally brought together\nand their potential as performance\nscores; what happened was a continuing\nemergence of confluences. Each artist\nhas brought their individual perspective\nto the working process, observing the\ngradual convergence of energies and response.\nWhat has interested me so\nmuch is the dual development of accumulation\nand distillation. The folded\ndrawings being the accumulated record\nof working sessions. The sound and\nmovement being the resonance of ur\nmutual understanding.\nInitially, a body in early pregnancy\nand a need to re-evaluate movement\ninvolvements and ways of being, combined\nwith the decision to pursue Authentic\nMovement. This encouraged a\nvery slow/non-moving or few movements/closed\neyes/waiting-stance in\nterms of source and topic for improvisation.\nThis became mixed with open\neye observation of other participants.\nThis very internal and self-involved period\nstarted changing after a few weeks\ntowards a more interactive relationship\nwith Bill, Michelle and Jay. More frequent\neye contact, touching, duets—an\noverall closeness. Solos retained some\npossibility for the earlier absorbed kind\nof movement. I should note that opportunities\nfor solos sometimes happened\nwith other activity carrying on in\nthe room.\n\nMeg Cott\n\n\nWhen we first talked about how we\nwanted to approach working together\neveryone seemed interested in simplicity—not\ngiving directions or outlining\ngoals. So we each engaged in what we\npersonally felt moved to explore within\nour own medium. We observed each\nother and interacted with one another.\nWe have returned to this process for\neach rehearsal.\nThere are several challenges in having\nno prearranged directions, rules or\ncues. Though we originally strived for\nsimplicity, the environment we created\ncan be particularly demanding. The\ndemands fall on one's focus and creativity;\nto stay alert, responsive and sensitive\nwithout being able to rely on any preconceived\nnotions of what is expected\nor appropriate. One's state of mind\nmust be far more lucid than if things\nwere mapped out. When I dance a ‘\npiece in which every step has been\nwell-rehearsed, I don't have to make the\nsame kind of creative decisions. My\nenergy is directed towards the execution\nand performance of the choreography.\nIn Current, what I dance is the creating\nof the choreography. My impetus to\nmove is related to my personal convictions,\nthe other artists' activities and the\noverall effect of our interactions as a\ngroup.\nThe challenge of this process increases\nwith the addition of an audience.\nIn the studio my task is to follow\nmy individual impulses while responding\nto and assimilating the other activity\naround me. In a performance, the presence\nof the audience will become as important\nan element of the environment\nas the music, movement, drawings or\nsculpture and consequently part of what\naffects my choices. So, given that the\naudience will witness what has been our\nrehearsal process and not a previously\narranged or defined product, it will be\ninteresting to see how the audience may\ntransform the work, and in turn how\nthey will experience it.\n\nMichelle Distel dancer\n\n\n\nWe met twenty-five or so times to engage\nin a process that continued most\nfeatures of our first meeting. Through\nrepeating our unspoken structure, a form\narose that combined our individual\npractices with a deepening awareness of\neach other. I was impelled as much by\na desire to meet and combine as to\ncreate a “performance.\" I think our way\nof working together was as much a social\nform as a performance form.\nThe four public showings were quite\ndifferent from each other. The first happened\nas part of the opening of my\nexhibition at No. B.I.A.S. We warmed\nup ahead of time, withdrew from the\nspace as people came in and then found\na way with movement and sound to\nmake space within the viewers. At the\nend of this showing we invited others to\ncome and join us on subsequent Tuesdays.\nSeveral came back the next Tuesday\nand joined in, including several\nchildren, while a new smaller audience\ncame to watch. This session was quite\nwonderful and spontaneous but also\nmore diffuse, disjointed, undifferentiated.\nFor the third meeting we invited\nthose who came to work with us to\nwarm up with us, then watch while we\nworked together. Then we stopped to\ntalk about our way of working and afterwards\nresumed with the others joining\nin. Some who had come simply to be\naudience “played\" too. I found this\nsession successful, especially after we\nstarted up again, when everyone's contribution\ncreated a sense in the room\nthat was strong and satisfying.\nThe last session was different again.\nA few of us arrived early and started\nworking before any audience arrived.\nThose who came to work with us joined\nin easily and those who came to watch\nfound their way around the gallery space\nas we did. As attention points moved\nfrom one side of the space to the other,\nthe audience did too. It seemed as if\naudience, sculpture, drawings and participants\nwere in simultaneous motion.\nI realize more than ever that I am\ninterested in exploring and working with\nforms that come from attention to the\nsituation at hand.\n\nBill\n\nMaking a personal process public always\nhas some unexpected results. The performance\nduring the gallery opening\nstands as a unique/not wholly satisfying\nevent unto itself. Maintaining a trueness\nto the varying rhythms of our long\nestablished working process was very\ndifficult with such a large viewing\ngroup. Other sessions where there were\n“watchers\" had, as part of the process,\na steady drawing in of those present.\nDrawing in by eye contact, feeling and\nproximity. I realize in retrospect this\nwas a part of the working process we\nmight have taken pains to articulate in\norder to make participation possible\nwith a large group of viewers. I don't\nthink the same problems would have occurred\nif the group was physically participating.\nThe arrival, exchange and discussions\nwith a pretty wide variety of community\nmembers was interesting and\nsatisfying. This took a slightly different\nform and tone each week depending on\nwho showed up and what we felt was\nneeded. The openness, forcible change,\ninclusiveness, stimulation, and heightened\nawareness of the community interaction\nis a long longed-for and treasured\nexperience. I guess it's this feeling that\nsparkles in my memory.\n\nMeg\n\n\nThe word improvisation was often used\nto describe our process. The dictionary\ndefinition of improvise is: to compose\nor invent without preparation. Consequently,\none would need to be unprepared\nin order to truly improvise. Although\nour first meeting was indisputably\nimprovisation, it seems to me that\nthe degree or amount of our work together\nwhich remained solely improvi-\nsational decreased proportionally with\neach meeting.\nThis idea poses a challenge to the\nparticipants when their goal is to improvise.\nGranted, in any process or\nperformance there will always be something\nwhich one will be unprepared for,\nbut unless one goes out of her/his way\nto create a new situation, one is recreating\nprevious situations.\nO nce a group has worked together,\nthey have to some degree developed a\nvocabulary. As the vocabulary increases,\nso does the element of predictability-\nTo me improvisation is an indispensable\ntool with which one creates, composes\nor choreographs. O nce something\nhas been created, how does one\nmaintain the element of improvisation\nin successive meetings?\nPersonally, I feel that improvisation\nis a form which is executed in relation\nto a structure. Improvisation is done\noff of a form. To improvise off of\nsomething which has no form is something\nelse. W hen one improvises, I\nbelieve one is making a personal statement\namidst a variety of set statements.\nStructure can “exist\" without improvisation\nbut cannot be “created\"\nwithout improvisation. It does not\nseem possible to have true improvisation\nwithout structure. To work with\nno mutual structure whatsoever is to\nspontaneously compose. W e, each of\nthe artists, are drawing from the entirety\nof our vocabularies to create material\nat our meetings.\nI believe the challenges we incurred\nwhen taking our work out of the studio\nand into the performance spaces are\ndirectly related to our form. In my\nmind the form we chose required us to\nbe composing and not improvising. To\ncompose amongst three other artists of\nvarying media is one set of challenges.\nTo compose and perform amidst an\neager audience is another.\n\nJay",

    "Abstract": "This article explores the neurological processes involved in improvisational decision-making, focusing on the cyclical exchange of information between the brain and the body. It presents a model of how the brain receives sensory input, generates movement signals, and evaluates the results to inform subsequent actions. The author emphasizes the complexity and speed of this process, suggesting that the brain proactively seeks information to navigate the demands of improvisation.",
    "Content": "I recently had reason to do\nsome thinking about improvisation.\nI was scheduled to lecture at Mid-\ndlebury College in Vermont about my\nquantum-based model of the improvising\nmind (CQ, Vol. 19, No. 1), but I\nwanted the students to understand the\nmodel within a larger context of impro-\nvisational decision-making. In particular,\nI wanted to explore two aspects of\nthe decision process: first, the neurological\ncycle of action and information\nexchange that occurs within the improviser\nat the moment of decision; and,\nsecond, the types of improvisational\ndecisions that we make. The following\nis a brief presentation of these ideas.\nI/O PROCESSING\nThe deeper we try to peer into the\ninternal flow of information during\nimprovisation (the brain's input/output\n' processing to borrow from the computer\nlexicon), the murkier the view becomes.\nThis is because much of the electrochemical\nactivity during decision-making\noccurs within the confines of the\nbrain itself, and scientists are just beginning\nto scratch at the surface of\nunderstanding internal brain function.\nWhat we are better able to identify and\nmonitor are the signals that come into\nand out of the brain through the central\nnervous system1\nA simplified view of nerve structure\ndescribes two pathways for neural\ninformation—efferent and afferent.\nEfferent nerves send signals from the\nbrain out to the muscles and organs.\nThese outbound messages are electrochemical\ndemands for action. Afferent\nnerves send signals back to the brain\nfrom the five external senses and the\nbody's proprioceptive systems. These\ninbound messages provide the brain\nwith information about the body in\nrelation to itself and its environment.\nTo provide an image of how this\ntwo-way traffic operates during improvisation,\nI created the following circular\nmodel:2\n• Signals Sent: A complex set of\nneural instructions is sent from the\nbrain, through the efferent nerves,\nand out towards a variety of muscles.\nThese instructions, all combined,\nwill produce a specific\nmovement.\n• Signals Received: There is a brief\ndelay (measured in milliseconds)\nwhile the signals travel to and\narrive at their various destinations.\n• Movement Results: Almost immediately,\nthe muscles contract, causing\nmovement.\n• Monitoring Beings: Movement\ntriggers the proprioceptive systems\nto send signals back to the brain\nabout the relative \"success\" of the\nintended movement, and more\ngenerally, about the state of the\nbody in time and space. Such\ninformation is also gathered from\nthe five external senses.\n• Information Ordered and Evaluated:\nThe amount of information\nreturning from the periphery is\nstaggering, yet somehow we find a\nway to make sense of it all.\n• Brain Generates New Signals:\nThis is the moment of decision,\nwhere we choose whether to adjust\nand continue the previous movement,\ncontinue with the next movement\nof an intended series, or set\noff in an entirely new direction.3\nAs I mentioned in my last article\n[\"More Thoughts on Science and\nthe Improvising Mind,\" CQ 19:1],\nthe brain may, at this moment,\ncreate multiple sets of signals, corresponding\nto various possibilities,\nbut eventually must send just one\nset.\nWhile this diagram provides a\nclean and simple look at information\nflow, the reality of this cycle is, of\ncourse, much more complicated. The\nsignals do not travel out, then in, then\nSignals Sent\nout, then in. Information is going in\nboth directions unceasingly. It is up to\nthe brain to sort out the pulses and\ndecide how they relate to movement\nintentions. New decisions must often\nbe made before a complete picture of\nthe last movement can be gleaned from\nthe returning signals. Having to make\nquick decisions at this kind of informational\ndisadvantage places a certain\nkind of pressure on our brains. I believe\nthat this forces our brains to take\na more proactive role in information\ngathering. Instead of simply relying on\nsignals already returning, our brains\n\"seek out\" desired information by\nsending out a separate, primarily unconscious,\nset of movement instructions\nwhich are demands for the muscles\nthat control our senses, our eyes, ears,\netc., to perform specific information\ngathering tasks.\nJames J. Gibson, in his fascinating\nbook The Senses Considered as Perceptual\nSystems, has addressed this issue by\ndividing movements into two categories—performatory\nand exploratory.\nPerformatory movements simply accomplish\nmovement-oriented goals\n(e.g., raise your arm, take a step, etc.).\nExploratory movements are specifically\ndesigned to gather information (e.g.,\nturn your head to the right, and then\nshift and focus your eyes to check\nwhere the edge of the space is). In the\nsubtle reality of movement improvisation,\n\"performatory\" and \"exploratory\"\nare ends of a spectrum, not an either/\nor proposition. Actions of the sensory\norgans are not reserved exclusively for\nexploration. Looking, listening, touching,\netc., can be gestures and therefore\nhave a performatory intention. And\nmost improvisers would probably\nagree that movement in any part of the\nbody (not just eyes or ears, etc) can be\nexploratory. The dividing lines are\nunclear, but thinking about and moving\nwith Gihson's ideas can spark a new\nunderstanding of movement intentions.\nINTENDING DECISIONS\nThe most mysterious and challenging\npart of the decision cycle, and the\npart that dominates much of my own\ntheorizing, is the area between the\nevaluation of information and the sending\nof a new signal. This is the moment\nof decision itself. In the past, I\nhave attempted to shed light on this\ncomplex process by applying equally\ncomplex paradigms derived from chaos\ntheory and quantum theory. This time\nI would like to approach the decisionmaking\nquandary more directly by\nattempting to make sense of the\n\"types\" of decisions I see myself and\nother improvisers making while moving.\nTo avoid confusion, I want to make\nclear that the decisions I am discussing\ndeal more with \"intention\" than with\nthe actual movement result, because I\nfeel that the interpretations of any\n\"movement,\" either apparent or unseen,\nare so multifarious as to be beyond\nexplication. But when I focused\nmy thinking on the \"intention\" (you'll\nsee that I am using this term loosely)\nbehind decisions, I was surprised that\nonly four types came to mind. They\nare as follows:\n• Initiating\n\"Initiating\" is choosing to perform\nan action. It involves a conscious\nintention about moving, or\nperhaps a focusing of conscious\nawareness on an aspect of being/\nmoving. It could be as obvious as\nchoosing to perform a muscular\ncontraction or release, or it could be\nas subtle as consciously monitoring\nthe sensation of your own blood-\nflow.\n• Reacting\n\"Reacting\" is not a conscious\ndecision. It might be better called a\n\"body\" or \"pre-conscious\" decision\nbecause it happens before we can\nengage our initiating consciousness.\n\"Reacting\" is movement that stems\nfrom instinct or from our habitual\nmovement patterns (these can be\ninnate or trained). It is movement\nfor which no thinking (higher brain\nfunction) is required. It is often\nour means of protection when falling\nor when an object is hurtling\ntowards us; and sometimes, even\nwhen we are not protecting ourselves\nfrom a specific danger or\nfalling back on old habits, the\nspeed and force of our moving surpasses\nthe pace at which we are\ncomfortable initiating, so w e must\nallow our reactions to take over.\nAt this point, it becomes difficult to\ndistinguish reacting from some\nforms of \"flowing\" (see below).\n• Not Doing\n• \"Not Doing\" is just that It is a\nconsious decision to not initiate or\nto not react. It is the intention of\ninhibiting movement or some aspect\nof moving. Of course we, as living\ncreatures, are unable to ever truly\nstop moving. But if you were in a\nstable position and chose to not\ninitiate (and no outside force was\nacting upon you), only autonomic\nor semi-autonomic movements4\nwould occur, and you would go\nnowhere until you released the\ninhibition. Not reacting, then, is a\nconscious choice to try to override\na body decision before it can be\nexecuted. For example, if you were\nfalling and suppressed your body's\nnatural protective movements, you\nmight find yourself performing\nmovements that were dangerous\nand/or unusual.\n• Flowing\n\"Flowing\" is allowing our\nbodies to follow the physical or\naesthetic momentum created by\ncertain movements, impulses, or\nimages through to an organic conclusion.\nIt is a \"decision\" to disengage\nor not engage the initiating\nconsciousness. Where reacting was\npre-conscious, flowing is sub-conscious\nor unconscious. Flowing can\nbe as simple as coming to the \"natural\nend\" of a gesture you initiate,\nor it can be as subtle and enthralling\nas the long sequences of moving\nwe can experience when truly\nengaged at a body level.\nAs with Gibson's performatory/exploratory\ndualism, the lines between\ndecision types are quite fuzzy. I see no\nreason to think certain improvisational\nchoices could not arise from two or\nmore categories in combination, or that,\nif you looked at different parts of the\nbody separately, you might not see all\nfour categories presented simultaneously.\nCategorization, though, is not my\nprimary intention. I hope, by thinking\nand moving on parallel tracks, to spur\nmyself on to a greater understanding\nof what I consider to be ultimately\nunfathomable. CQ has provided a\nforum for me to put these thoughts out\ninto the collective improvisational\nunconscious in an effort to find agreement\nor amendment or debate. If these\nideas interest you, move with them\nPonder them Please let me know\nwhat you find. \n\n\nNOTES\n1 By central nervous system, I am referring\nto the brain and spinal cord. Also, I\napologize for the standard dualistic\n\"body or brain\" language of these descriptions.\nTo do justice to a more integrated\napproach to this material would\ninvolve many more words and sidetrack\nthe article away from the simple points I\nam hoping to convey. I hope to delve\nmore deeply into the structure and function\nof the nervous system during improvisation\nin a future article.\n2 This visual/verbal model is an adaptation\nand an elaboration of a verbal\nmodel by the music psychologist Jeff\nPressing. His article, \"Improvisation:\nMethods and Models\" is well worth\nreading and can be found in the book\nGenerative Processes in Music: The Psychology\nof Performance, Improvisation, and Composition,\nedited by John A. Sloboda; Clarendon\nPress, Oxford; 1988.\n3 This whole cycle also applies to the\nperformance of pre-existing material, the\ndifference lies in the fact that in that case\nmore emphasis is placed on the \"template\"\nfor the material. The signal generated\nis provided by that template. Proprioceptive\nresponse and evaluation\nemphasize the measuring of actual results\nagainst the template. Then subsequent\nsignals are often adjusted to more closely\nmeet the performer's interpretation of the\ntemplate. I believe that improvisation\ndemands a \"broader\" awareness to facilitate\nthe simultaneous invention and execution\nof a newly created template, and\nthat the best improvisers are those that\ncan achieve this broader awareness without\nsacrificing the subtle attentiveness of\nperformance.\n4 Autonomic movements are movements\nperformed by parts of the body over\nwhich we basically have no control (i.e.,\nheartbeat, circulation, etc.) Semi-auto-\nnomic movements are those over which\nwe have limited control (you cannot stop\nbreathing indefinitely, but you can speed\nit up, slow it down, or stop it for a short\ntime).",

    "Abstract": "This article presents a case study of using movement within Process Oriented Psychology to help a client address her difficulties with planning and commitment. By focusing on a spontaneous gesture and amplifying it into a dance, the client accesses a deeper understanding of herself and discovers a new, more spontaneous approach to life. The article highlights the core principles of process work, emphasizing the importance of following the flow of experience and finding solutions within unexpected movements and dreams.",
    "Content": "The following is an example of the application of\nmovement work in process oriented psychology.\nOne day, a client of mine sat down and began to\ntalk very seriously about problems she was having\nmaking plans and commitments. As she talked, her\nmotions were quite intense and linear except for a\nfleeting moment when one of her hands quickly\ntossed a sweater she was carrying into the air,\nthrowing it in a nonchalant manner off to the side.\nWhen I encouraged her to notice this unexpected\ntossing of the sweater and to focus her awareness\non the quality of that movement, she seemed shy but\ncurious to find out what that motion was about.\nShe picked up the sweater again and seemed to\nenjoy flippantly tossing it into the air. After she did\nthis a number of times, I asked her to stand up and\ntry the same movement but this time without the\nsweater.\n\nShe stood up and experimented with quick, indirect,\nflicking movements as she threw her arms, legs, head\nand finally her whole body in unexpected spurts in\nmany directions around the room. She laughed, thoroughly\nenjoying the sense of abandon and freedom.\nBut suddenly she stopped and said sheepishly, “I don’t\nknow what I’m doing. It feels great but could it be\nhelpful?” I suggested that she follow this mysterious\ndance just a bit longer and let its meaning reveal itself\nto her.\n\nI joined her in her dance as we threw ourselves in\nquick lunges and spurts around the room. As we\nmoved I asked her to make a face to go along with the\nquality of her movements and possibly add sounds as\nwell. Her eyes opened wide as she made strong blowing\nsounds with her mouth. I then asked her to “see”\nwhat she was doing, or tell a story about it. She said\nshe saw and felt the image of a great wind goddess\nwho was following the winds of fate! She continued to\nunfold the story of this wind goddess as she tumbled\nand turned in an unexpected and thrilling way.\nWhen she finally landed on the ground, smiling,\nshe said she realized that this was the quality she\nneeded in dealing with her everyday problems: not\nso much organizing, analyzing or planning life but\ninstead—living it spontaneously!\n\nThis is an example of a woman who unfolded her\nprocess through the tools of process oriented psychology.\nThe woman is not a dancer, but found her own natural\ndance by focusing on her spontaneous motions and allowing\nthem to unfold. She discovered through her dance a\nnew attitude toward her life, and a world of possibilities.\n\nProcess Work\nProcess oriented psychology, commonly called ‘process\nwork’, was developed by my partner Arnold Mindell and\nassociates in Switzerland and the U.S. over the past 25\nyears. Process work is a form of psychotherapy which at\nits core is based on the ancient knowledge of Taoism and\nthe inherent wisdom of nature. It respects the known and\nunderstandable world while delving into the mysterious,\ndreamlike and unknown dimensions of life. Its application\nranges from working with people in near death and comatose\nstates to group and political work, relationship work,\nmovement and bodywork, meditation, and art work. Process\nwork reveals that the seeds of solutions and great\nsources of creativity are found just in those places we least\nexpect it: in our most difficult problems, in our spontaneous\nmovements, and in our dreams.\n\nMovement, in the most general sense of the word, is\nthe core of process work because the term “process” means\nthe flow of experience, the movement which is inherent in\nlife and nature. Like Taoists who spend their lives studying\nand adjusting to the on-going transformations in nature,\nthe process worker notices and joins the river of our experiences\nand attempts to assist nature in its unfolding.\nWhether focusing on a body symptom, dream, movement,\nrelationship conflict, a group interaction, or an extreme\nstate of consciousness (otherwise called psychosis), the\nprocess worker asks, “What is moving? What is changing?”\nand attempts to follow nature’s winding path.\n\nStates and Processes\nA process orientation towards life contrasts with a\nstate-oriented view of events. A static view of life tends to\nlabel experiences with names which are only momentarily\napplicable. Such names as “pain,” “relationship trouble,”\nor “movement difficulties,” are only static descriptions of\ndynamic processes which are in the process of unfolding.\nOnce we tap into and follow the movement inside of these\nmomentary states, we discover fluid and creative processes.\nLike all movement-oriented people, process workers understand\nevents by getting into the stream of experience rather\nthan analyzing life from the outside. Most importantly,\nprocess work focuses on the creative spark behind our\nindividual, couple or group experiences.\n\nPerception and Channels\nWhen I went to Zurich in 1980, I had been trained in\ndance and was looking for a way to work with people with\nmovement which delved deeply into each person’s individual\nnature and creativity. I absolutely loved dance, but felt\nthat I was a bit stuck in my movement repertoire. Process\nwork afforded me a vocabulary to understand my movement\nprocesses and go beyond my own perceptual movement\nboundaries. Let me speak generally about process\ntheory and then specifically about movement.\nSignals are bits of information which manifest in different\nchannels—a stomach pain, a gesture, a relationship\nsituation. Channels are modes of experience, neutral or\nempty vessels through which information manifests. The\nchannels most commonly identified are the kinesthetic\n(movement), visual (visions, dreams, hallucinations), auditory\n(outer and inner sounds or voices), proprioceptive\n(inner body sensations and/or feelings), and relationship\nand world channels which occur when we focus on our\ninteractions with other people or on events in the world\nand environment.\nProcess, as we use the term, refers to the evolving flow\nof signals as they appear and move through the various\nchannels. The art of process work is to follow and aid the\nnatural flow or movement of process as it winds its own\nunique path of development.\nProcesses are structured by their relative distance from\none’s awareness. The term primary process refers to\nthose aspects of our process which are close to our awareness,\nwith which we identify in a given moment. In the\nexample of the wind goddess, we notice that her primary\nintention or process was quite serious and focused on\nproblems having to do with making plans and commitments.\nSecondary processes refer to all events which we\nexperience as “happening to us,” which are farther away\nfrom our awareness and with which we do not identify,\nlike the toss of the sweater that led us to the great wind\ngoddess.\nThe terms primary and secondary are different from the\nterms “conscious” and “unconscious.” This difference is\ndue to several factors. Our primary process is normally\nnot completely conscious or under our conscious control.\nIt is a particular identity which we have adopted and which\nmay be hard to change even if we want to. Also, primary\nand secondary processes can flip back and forth, depending\nupon what we are identifying with in a given moment.\nWe use certain channels as part of our primary and\nother channels as part of our secondary processes. The\nchannels that we use in conjunction with our primary\nprocess are called occupied channels. These we use\nregularly with some degree of awareness. Occupied channels\ncan be determined by listening to the way in which we\nuse language, particularly by the use of the active verb\nform. For example, sentences like “I see myself as a\nbusiness person” indicate that the visual channel is occupied\nchannel might be indicated by a statement such as\n“Sometimes, I just jump out of my skin.” Occupied movement\ncan also be recognized when the movements, or\nmovement gestures, complete themselves, and also when\nthe movements closely mirror what the person is saying\nverbally.\nUnoccupied channels are aspects of our secondary\nprocesses. These channels are not used with conscious\nawareness. We determine unoccupied channels by noticing\nthe way we use verbs passively in our speech. In a therapeutic\ncontext, phrases like “people are looking at me”\nindicate an unoccupied visual channel because other people\nare doing the looking, not me. Unoccupied movement may\nbe detected in such sentences as “She can stand up to the\nboss, but I can’t,” or “The tree bent in the wind.” Unoccupied\nmovement is also indicated by recurrent, spontaneous\nand incomplete gestures, movement-oriented accidents, and\nunintentional body motions.\nIt is important to notice unoccupied channels because\nthey give us the most rapid access to our deepest processes\nwe are allowing ourselves to notice. That is why encouraging\na client to use an unoccupied movement channel by\nsimply standing up, can reveal both her or his entire life\nhistory and current process in the space of a few seconds.\nProcess work embraces secondary experiences as the\nseeds of new life and helps them unfold through the technique\nof amplification. Amplification means strengthening\na signal in the particular channel in which an experience is\noccuring in order to bring out its full message. My client,\nfor example, amplified her movement first by putting her\nfocus on it, then by standing up and using her whole body,\nthen by making a face which mirrored her movement and\nfinally by creating a dance. Processes can be unfolded in\ngreat depth by using the technique of changing channels,\nor adding on other channels. In this example, I asked the\nwoman to change channels by making sounds which mirrored\nher movements. I then encouraged her to switch\nchannels once again and create a visual image of her experience\nin her mind, which she further developed into a\nstory.\nDifferentiating Movement\nThe differentiation of movement into primary and\nsecondary movements has been extremely helpful to me in\ngoing beyond my own movement repertoire and delving\ndeeply into my own and my clients’ “dreaming” processes.\nPrimary movements are intentional and congruent with our\nmomentary identity. We understand them, they make sense\nto us. In the example of my client, her intense and direct\nmotions are primary because they mirror her primary intention\nto talk seriously about her problems.\nSecondary movements are unintentional, spontaneous\nand incongruent with our primary identity. These secondary\nmovements are dream-like communications which are\nmysterious and surprising. They do not complete themselves,\nand we do not readily understand them. Secondary\nmovements are like the beginning of a sentence which\nstops in mid-air! They have a tendency to repeat themselves\nuntil we notice them and help them unfold. A\nsecondary movement in my client’s process occurred when\nshe threw her sweater in the air. The quality of this movement\nwas incongruent with her primary intention.\nIt is not easy to recognize these secondary movements\nand stay with them, although this can be one of the goals\nof improvisational and creative dance. Unintentional\nmovements can happen very rapidly like a quick stumble, a\nshrug of the shoulders, or a movement tic. It is all too\neasy to fool ourselves and focus on those aspects of our\nmovements which we like or favor, and to ignore or simply\nnot notice those aspects which we do not understand, or\nwhich are distasteful, fleeting, strange, unintentional or\ndifferent from the way we have identified ourselves. We\nmight get attached to moving in a certain way and ignore\nsecondary movements which momentarily disrupt our\nprimary movement flow.\nNoticing primary and secondary movements that occur\nwhile we are speaking or moving, and focusing on them\nwith awareness not only leads to more creative options but\nalso minimizes movement injuries. We have found that\nbecause secondary processes have a tendency to amplify\nand repeat themselves in order to be known, forewarnings\nof movement injuries can be seen in tiny, secondary movement\nsignals.\nThe Edge\nCentral to process oriented movement awareness is the\nability to notice movement “edges.” The edge is the\nboundary between primary and secondary processes. It\nappears when something new arises and we are confronted\nwith the boundaries of our known world.\nThe edge appears in movement when we begin to\nexplore a secondary movement and suddenly stop, become\nconfused, giggle, or doubt the value of our experience. If\nwe continue to move, we may subtly revert back to our\nprimary process movement theme. All of our fears and\nbeliefs which forbid us to explore new territory arise at the\nedge. Remember the woman in the example? She stopped\nat one moment, became shy and doubted her experience.\nShe was perched at the edge of something new, something\nunknown. This woman only needed a bit of encouragement\nto go over her edge and explore a new world. But\nalways take care to watch which way the process wants to\nflow! At times it might be necessary to go more deeply\ninto the belief systems which stop us from exploring secondary\nsignals before attempting to go over the edge.\nIf you are moving and feel that your movement is\nrepeating itself or if you feel bored, you might check out if\nyou missed an edge. At this point you might ask yourself\n“Where was the last point of energy?” The answer to this\nquestion may lead you right back to the moment when a\nsecondary movement appeared but was let go of.\nThe edge can be very elusive. I remember watching\ntwo women moving together in a very fluid way.\nThey faced one another, palms together, and rocked\nsmoothly back and forth. This was their primary\nmovement process. As they moved, however, there\nwere very slight pushes with their hands which\nwere incongruent with the rhythm and force of the\nrest of their movement. Here was an edge to notice\nand explore. When encouraged to follow these\npushes, they began to wrestle, challenged one another\nand enjoyed feeling their strength.\nMetaskills\nI have just mentioned a number of process oriented\ntools. Yet, process work, or any therapeutic method, is\nmore than a set of technical skills. The art of process\nwork also includes what I am calling metaskills—feeling-\noriented attitudes which accompany and enhance techniques.\nThe way in which we work with ourselves and\nothers, the way we approach numinous and mysterious\nmovements, is a matter of feeling. Certain metaskills and\nfeelings make it possible to open up to new experiences\nand value our stream of experience.\nWhether working with herself or with others, a process\nworker compassionately embraces both those elements of\nexperience which are close to awareness and those which\nare farther away, which are unknown and surprising. She\ncreates a nurturing vessel in which even the tiniest secondary\nsignals can grow. She does not throw away disturbing\nor surprising experiences but recycles them, providing a\nfertile soil in which they can develop. She also needs the\nmetaskill of courage to make room for new aspects of life\nto emerge when consensus reality seems to forbid them.\nShe will use the metaskills of creativity and playfulness as\nwell as the Zen ‘beginner’s mind’ which do not prejudge\nexperiences but allow them to explain themselves as they\nunfold. She sensitively explores the edge and notices in\nwhich direction the river wants to flow. And perhaps most\nimportantly, she must have a basic movement orientation\nwhich fluidly adapts to the unique changes and surprises in\nany given process.\nThe Dreambody and the Dreaming Process\nLet’s return to the development of process work and\nthe connection between movement and body symptoms.\nAmy made a fascinating discovery many years ago. At\nthat time, he was a Jungian analyst in Zurich, Switzerland\nand believed very strongly in Jung’s idea that our dreams\nare meaningful expressions of our inner lives. Jung approached\ndreams like a medieval alchemist. He took the\ndream (the alchemists would call it ‘prima materia’), focused\non it (or put it in a pot so to speak) and with appreciation\nand dedication cooked the contents until they instructed\nus about our lives (turned to gold!). Amy wondered\nif the same attitude could be applied to body symptoms.\nWhat would it be like to follow body experiences as\nif they were potentially meaningful?\nDuring that time, Arny had a client who was dying\nof stomach cancer. After an operation, and while\nstill under partial anesthesia, the man told Amy in\nan excited, almost elated, tone that his tumor was\nstill growing. Though Arny reassured the man that\nhis tumor had just been removed, the man insisted\nthat it was still growing and began to make movements\nthat pushed out and expanded his stomach.\nWanting to validate this man’s experience, yet worried\nthat continuing this movement might burst the\nman’s stitches, Arny encouraged him to change\nsensory-oriented channels by translating this movement\nexperience into a visual picture.\nThe man reported that he saw a picture of fireworks\nand suddenly said, “Oh, but that is what I\ndreamed the other night! I dreamed that there was\nan explosion of fireworks on Independence Day and\nthat that would be my healing!” In other words,\nthe experience he had in his body was mirrored in\nhis dream. This man was ordinarily quite shy.\nArny helped him to explode his sense of shyness by\nbecoming more expressive in his everyday life. He\nlived much longer than expected. (See Arny’s\nWorking with the Dreaming Body, 1984.)\nFrom this experience and countless others, Amy developed\nthe concept of the dreambody: the idea that our\nsecondary body experiences and our night-time dreams\nmirror each other. In fact, this example shows that we do\nnot only dream at night but that our bodies are dreaming\nall of the time in our sometimes disturbing, mysterious and\nunintentional secondary body signals and movements. We\nneed only notice these experiences throughout the day and\nhelp them unfold in order to tap into our on-going dreaming\nprocess.\n\nThe Neglected Channel\n\nIn industrialized cultures, the movement channel is\noften unoccupied. Furthermore, for most people, even for\nsome of us trained in movement, it may be unusual to learn\nto use out awareness to follow unintentional movement\npnvesses. Many people learn to walk and move properly.\nKit not to follow then unique, mysterious, often unpredictable\nmovement signals.\nThere are numerous examples which I could give from\nour process oriented movement clinics (led by Kate Jobe,\nNisha Zenoff, Amy and myself) or the Lava Rock body\nsymptoms clinics (led by Amy, Max Schuepbach and staff)\non the Oregon coast. The following example occurred\nduring a session with a woman with cerebral palsy at a\nLava Rock clinic. It illustrates the difference between\n“learned” and “spontaneous” movement\nThe woman came to the center of the room in order\nto focus on her movement process. She began to\nwork with Arny as other seminar participants\nlooked on. She said that she had cerebral palsy\nfrom birth. She also said that she was interested in\na childhood dream she had had in which she was\nwith her family in a castle and everyone was having\na really happy and fun time together. (Arny’s research\nhas shown that childhood dreams are connected\nto life myths and chronic symptoms).\nThe woman continued to explain that in order to\nmove somewhere, she must first concentrate very\nexactly on where she wants to go and only after\ncareful deliberation is she able to begin to move in\nthat direction. She said that this sort of concentration\nis very tiring but that nevertheless this is the\nway she had learned to get through life. This is her\nprimary way of moving, her intention and means of\ngetting along with her movement process.\nIn order to stay close to her physical movement\nprocess, and hopefully in this way to find out more\nabout her dream, Arny asked her how she would\nmove if she did not concentrate on where she wanted\nto move but allowed her body to move in its own\nnatural way. He was asking about her secondary\nmovement experience. The woman was excited to\nfind out what would happen but afraid that she\nmight fall. Amy encouraged her to sit on the floor\nand to experiment from this safe position.\nShe sat down, closed her eyes, and followed her\nnatural movement tendencies. Arny sat with her so\nshe would not feel alone and helped her to follow\nher movement. She began to sway back and forth,\nand started to crawl sideways across the floor. She\nthen wanted to try this movement standing up.\nOthers from the seminar stood around her in case\nshe lost her balance. She started to move sideways\nand her motions began to transform as she added a\nslight lilt, a kind of light, rhythmic quality to her\nmotions as she moved and swayed from side to side.\nShe began to laugh and laugh. She said, “Oh, this\nis so much fun! It is so easy! I don’t have to work\nhard!” Amy joined her in her movement as they\nplayed and experimented with this movement.\nEncouraged to allow the movement to unfold\nfurther, the vooman's fingers began to snap, her\nhead bobbed back and forth, and she started to hum\na jazz tune. Her body bopped from side to side and\nshe danced freely and sublimely. The rest of the\ngroup spontaneously started to sing and celebrate\nand joined her in her dance. She said it was like\nbeing with a happy family and suddenly recalled\nher childhood dream!\nchronic movement process and allowing it to unfold, she\nentered into her dreaming process, discovered her childhood\ndream, her connection to others and a splendid, magical\ndance. This experience was the beginning of a new\nway for her to live in her body and the world.\n\n\nQuick Access to the Dreaming Process through\nMovement\n\nInterestingly enough, we have found that because\nmovement is far from awareness (unoccupied) for many\npeople, it gives us quick access to the dreaming process,\nfor it is in those places that we have least awareness the\nthe dreaming process comes up most rapidly. Simply\nasking someone to walk around the room and to notice the\nmovements she or he is making which are “not simply\nwalking” can be the beginning of unfolding the dreaming\nprocess!\nI remember an elderly professional man who\nwas the head of a social agency and had developed\nprograms in many places around the world. As he\ntalked about his work he glowed. He had decided,\nhowever, that it was time for him to retire. He\ncomplained that he had weakness in his left leg.\nHe had already explored and taken care of the\nmedical causes for this weakness and was interested\nin finding out more about this movement difficulty.\nAmy and / asked him to walk around the room\nand notice anything that “wasn’t just walking.’’ He\nsaid that he noticed that his left leg was slower in\nrecovering its step than his right. With our encouragement\nthe man slightly amplified or exaggerated\nthe slowness of this leg. He focused intensely on\nhis experience as if in meditation. He bent even\nfurther down on his left knee and then stepped up to\nhis right.\nSuddenly, the man walked over to one of the\nseminar participants, bent down all the way to the\nground and bowed his head. He repeated this\nmotion several times until he knew why he was\nbowing. He finally said, “I am giving respect, I am\na servant.” He continued, “Wow, I thought I\nshould retire because of my age, but actually / am\nexcited about going back to work and doing more\nfor people and the world!\"\nThis man’s movement difficulty was not only pathological\nbut a meaningful aspect of his process. By asking him\nto walk around the room and amplify that aspect of his\nmovement which was “not just walking,” he unfolded the\nexperience in his leg and discovered his desire to continue\nin his role as a servant of the people.\nMovement and Coma Work\nAs process work began to develop and a school began\nin Zurich and in Portland, Oregon, it branched out into\nmany areas. But one area which has been most significant\nin my life has been the work with people in comatose\nstates. Movement and other forms of nonverbal communication\nare important in coma work because people in these\naltered states of consciousness do not relate in ordinary\nverbal ways. We have found that individuals in comatose\nconditions feel they are being intimately related to when\nwe are able to enter into their communication system.\nComa work involves noticing even the most minute movements\nand signals, following and helping them unfold.\nAn extensive description of process oriented coma work\ncan be found in Amy’s Coma: The Dreambody Near\nDeath. Let me briefly mention however, a few of the\nmovement signals which we have seen in coma work. For\nexample, the signal of a head turned slightly to the side\ncan, when amplified and encouraged, transform into the\ngesture of a child putting its cheek forward, so to speak,\nhoping for a caress. I have seen how the apparently spastic\nmotions of the arms of a comatose person become the\nbeginning of a wrestling match! In the same way, the\nslightest movements of a finger or a hand have transformed\ninto the response to an imaginary embrace from a lover. A\nheaving of the chest and gasping for breath became, from a\nperson near death, the singing of the inner child.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nProcess oriented movement awareness requires the\nability to differentiate intentional movements from unintentional\nones and to perceive edges. By embracing those\naspects of our movement experience which are far from\nour awareness, which are unknown and mysterious or\n“secondary,” and unfolding these through amplification and\nchannel changing, we discover our on-going dreaming\nprocess, night or day. In so doing, we break through\nconsensus reality revealing our own unexplored worlds. ★",

    "Content": "I am wanting to share with you\nsomething that came up at the West\nCoast Contact Dance Festival last\nsummer in Berkeley, California, organized\nLori B. It was a fantastic event of\nsharing, teaching, learning, and expanding.\nAnd there was an undercurrent\nrumble of slight what?, discontent?,\nchallenge? It took the form of some\nstudents expressing the feeling that\nthere was too much distinction being\nmade between students and teachers.\nThat the “hierarchy” was inappropriate.\nNow, we all have a fairly negative\ncharge on that “H” word and so I found\nmyself looking at this interesting development\nand wondering if this kind of\ngrumbling is going on elsewhere.\nI think there is a bit of confusion for\nstudents new to the form—especially\nthose coming from a more “new age”\napproach—that this is a form that everyone\nand anyone can do—that there\nRoll by Tica Lemos, imprinted in sand. \nAlcantara, Maranhao, north of Brasil.\nshould not be such distinctions between\nlevels of skill, that “hierarchy” is automatically\nbad.\nI found this disturbing.

    "Content": "I had the privilege of participating in\nthe Point Reyes Studies Project this\nyear, March 29 to April 3, 1994, in\nPoint Reyes, California. Organized by\nStephanos Georgantis and Ray Chung,\nthe Point Reyes Project is a gathering of\na group of improvisors from the Bay\nArea (and this one adopted Easterner) to\nexplore, discuss, create and perform\nimprovisation. We were: Anne Aronov,\nRay Chung, Jess Curtis, John Doyle,\nStephanos Georgantis, Rachel Kaplan,\nJo Kreiter, Chris Mathias, Stephanie\nMaher, Andy Meier, Carol Swann, John\nWeaver, Scott Wells, and myself, Libby\nWitzel.\nWe met for two preliminary evenings\nat the Zaccho Studio in San Francisco\nto generate ideas, interests, desires,\nto clarify our focus for the project\nand find out who we are as a group.\nOur discussion began by questioning the\neffect an audience has on improvisation:\nWhat is the difference between inner\npresence and outer presence? What\nhappens in the transition between soloing\nand duet? Between soloing internally\nand soloing externally? Longevity\nand Feedback were other interests\nraised. And for this displaced Easterner,\nthe question—is there a difference between\nEast Coast and West Coast Contact?\nWe worked in Point Reyes for three\ndays, practicing various scores which\ninvolved dancing for each other and\ngiving feedback. In small groups, one\nperson soloed while the others spoke out\nloud to the dancer about what they saw,\nexperienced, and witnessed as they\nwatched them move.\nMy personal favorite was our accumulation\nscore. Solo watches solo\nmover, gives feedback, reverse roles.\nThese two soloists become a duo, duo\nwatches another duo, gives feedback,\nreverse roles. These two duos become\na quartet, quartet watches another quartet,\ngives feedback, reverse roles. These\ntwo quartets become an octet, octet\nwatches octet, gives feedback, reverse\nroles. The two octets join, perform\ntogether for the rest of the group, the\naudience gives feedback. Remy Charlip\nhonored us with his presence as we\nworked—our grandfather, our timekeeper,\nour overseer.\nEvenings consisted of large quantities\nof food and long discussions about\nour sexiest moments on stage, sexuality\nissues in Contact, and sexuality in general\non the West Coast vs. the East\nCoast. What a delicious feast it all was.\nOur work culminated in a performance,\n“Defying Gravity,” on Easter Sunday at\nthe Dance Palace in Point Reyes.

Organized by Karen Nelson, the retreat brought together a diverse group of people with varying abilities to share research, network, and engage in self-generated exploration. The retreat fostered discussions around stereotypes and barriers, and used Contact Improvisation as a uniting factor.",
    "Content": "Retreat took place February 19 to 26,\n1994 at Camp Sealth, a rustic facility on\nVashon Island in Washington State. It\nwas organized by myself, Karen Nelson,\nwith the assistance of Joan Hanna and\nScott Smith. I had envisioned it as an\nideal meeting place where the work of\ndance between disabled and non-disabled\npeople could be explored in detail;\neach person bringing their own ideas for\nresearch and for ways to spend one\nweek in a rural retreat environment.\nFrom New Mexico, Europe, New\nYork, Oregon, Boston, Texas, California,\nIdaho, Vermont and Vashon Island/\nSeattle we were quite a varied population\nof teachers, performers, students,\ncommunity organizers, sign language\ninterpreters, physical therapists and\ndancers. There was a variety of physical\nabilities and so-called disabilities\nincluding people with cerebral palsy,\nvisual impairment, quadriplegia, postpolio\nsyndrome, deaf-blindness, single\nleg amputation and speech and motor\nfunction impairment due to head injury.\nThere were mostly adults, one child, and\na visit by some local kids. Also some\nof us rehearsed in public for a local\nelementary school, reaping beautiful\nartwork in response.\nFor many participants it was a place\nto meet and to network. It was also an\nopportunity to consider the activity of\nself-generated research and how to use\ntime constructively. Some people came\nknowing what they wanted to focus on,\nothers wanted to see what would come\nup at the site. Some people set about\nworking individually, some in small\ngroups, others wanted to function as a\nlarger group—making a group decision\non how to spend the time after all the\nideas had been put on the table. Ultimately,\nthere was enough room for all\nways to co-exist.\nThe dance form of contact improvisation\nwas a uniting factor. We\nwarmed-up and jammed together often.\nLive, improvised music was constantly\ninspiring. Many of the class offerings\ncentered on contact improv and also\nincluded work with vision, rolling mobility,\nASL (American Sign Language),\nNora Haj s and Sonny BoyArdee engaged i some research at breakfast.\n\ngroup scores, sounding, and a “no language”\nmorning emphasizing communication\nwithout known languages.\nWe had an informative session with\nSue Polland about injury prevention and\npotential hazards of movement for people\nwith specific limitations.\nThere were many discussions.\nDavid Sampson and Lori B initiated one\non “Hierarchy and Bias.” The following\nlist of stereotypes of disabled people\nwas made during that discussion, which\nincluded both disabled people (DP) and\nable-bodied people (AB).\nStereotypes: it’s hard for DP to do\nthings, they cannot speak for themselves,\nthey are ugly and physically\ndisgusting, mentally retarded children\nare cute, disabled people are inspirations,\nDP are really children (so can\nbehave like children), DP’s needs are\nendless, DP are too dependent, disabilities\nare contagious, people with\ncerebral palsy are more disabled\nthan paraplegics, disabled people are\nhard to communicate with, are delicate,\ncan’t compete with/match ABs,\ncan’t live without ABs, DP hold me\nback, DP are easily offended, DP are\neasy to take advantage of and get\naway with it, DP are incompe-\ntent/hold only menial jobs, DP are\nalways happy or always sad, DP are\njust disabled people.\nJulie Joyce, a dancer who directs\nBuen Viaje Dancers of Santa Fe, NM,\nan integrated performance company of\npeople with various physical and mental\nabilities and disabilities, brought up the\nquestion of why there aren’t more people\nwith developmental disabilities\npresent at ‘danceability’ workshops.\nPointing out a barrier there.\nRiley Ford is a 10 year old boy who\nis deaf and blind. His world is a place\nwhere movement and touch are the\nprimary sources of stimulation and\ninformation. His mother, Joyce Ford,\ntold us he was introduced to dance\nabout a year ago by dancer and sign\nlanguage interpreter, Harriet Jas-\ntremesky from Idaho. Harriet also\nworks with Riley in the classroom and\nit was she who suggested they come to\nDiverse Dance. They wanted to videotape\nRiley dancing with different people\nin order to show his movement choices\nwhile dancing and how he expresses\nhimself. Joyce is an activist for deaf-\nblind rights and awareness and she\ntravels extensively lecturing to parents\nof deaf-blind children. Joyce told us\nthat Riley’s world is based on touch,\nwithout touch he doesn’t exist.\nMany of us became tired of the\nword disabled and it was a relief when\nAlito Alessi came up with the idea to\nwrite the word “DISABILITY” with a\nslashed circle around the letter “D,”\nthereby slashing the notion of unwholeness:\n\nD^Tisability\n\nFinally, a public presentation entitled\nmlxEd UP: a dance performance\ncelebrating the diversity of the human\nbody, provided the opportunity to view\nand explore creative work. I was blown\naway by the work of Augustino Dance\nTheater from Oakland, California. In\nparticular, there was a duet performed\ncreated by Slobodan Dan Paich and\nAugustos Ferriols, in which Grace,\nwhom we had previously seen in a solo\nwheelchair dance, is now “standing” full\nheight in her grand ballgown gracefully\ndancing a “Zen Waltz” with her adoring,\ntights-clad, seemingly not disabled,\nmale partner. A bittersweet image of\nimmobility and freedom of movement\nand love.\nThere were several other works\ncreated during the retreat. Another\nstrong memory for me is a piece directed\nNo...Speak No,” for three disabled\nwomen (Bonnie, Kum Hee Hong, Karen\nRyan) who all appear sitting on three\nwhite boxes. Gradually they move off\nthe boxes and their unique and amazing\nstyles of locomotion reveal their “different”\nbodies, easily forgotten for a moment\nwhen they form a three-headed\ntotem pole. I love watching human\nbodies move, and to witness diversely\nshaped bodies that initiate movement in\nunusual patterns and timings is very\nrefreshing.",

    "Content": "Touchdown Dance is a project based\nin England that teaches Contact Improvisation\nto integrated groups of people\nwith and without visual impairment. It\nwas co-founded in 1986 by Steve Paxton\nand Anne Kilcoyne, who remained its\ndirectors until 1994, when the directorship\nwas passed to Katy Dymoke. [Eds.]\nIn July 1994, Anne Kilcoyne\nleft for America to start a new life.\nShe left behind boxes of addresses,\npapers, and tapes. I have a summer to\nbrowse through, digest it all and start\nto cultivate a company. Touchdown\nhas carried out a great deal of research,\nbeautiful work, to enable dance\nto be accessible to those without sight.\nFrom 1989 to 1993,1 worked in\nDenmark with deaf-blind and visually\nimpaired people through the Performance\nTraining Workshop which I cofounded.\nP.T.W. offered vocational\ntraining and workshops in the performing\narts for adults with and without\ndisabilities.\nThe group that I worked with the\nmost was the deaf-blind, whose communication\nsystem is through touch,\nand so have fewer taboos about physical\ncontact. One of the men in the\ngroup, Torben Hansen, determined\nfrom the start that this dance was a\nnatural extension of his own body\nlanguage, and we achieved huge progress\nworking together.\nA performance was created with\nTorben taking a major role. In this\nperformance, signs were integrated\ninto the movement, so the dance spoke\nto those who couldn't hear the music.\nWe invited blind people in the audi-\noiw to come onto the stage prior to\nthe sIk'\nnv and touch our costumes, fed\nthe set. .mi identify each person in\nterms of height, and shape. Having\nblind people m the audience of a\ndance piece was no longer an issue, as\nthey enjoyed the experience, the music,\nand the descriptions which enabled\nthem to receive the poetry.\nWe worked in good-sized rooms,\nwith wooden floors, as the sensing of\na good floor is of paramount importance\nwhen doing contact improvisation.\nNo doubt we had much fun:\nspontaneous ripples of laughter as we\ngot tied up, and gasps as we achieved\nthe next lift or roll or simply had a\ngood move.\nI was taught sign language, their\nlanguage became ours, and the collaboration\nbecame real. The communication\nbarrier was soon broken, time\nbecame dilated, and four years rolled\nby. Videos of the process show the\nreality: that a form that in its essence\nis pure and in its process non-discrim-\ninatory, is effectively enabling those\npreviously excluded from knowing a\ndance form that compliments their\nbodies, to now benefit and have a\nbetter quality of life. P.T.W. continues\ntoday, run by disabled artists.\nThis is not evangelical: Torben\nnow walks tall, no longer has periodic\ndepressions, and has attained employment\nwith the telephone company,\nteaching other deaf-blind to use the\nequipment. The joy of dance gave\nhim a new dimension, enriched his\ndesire to be physical in life, with\nothers, just as it does for me. The\nstory is not unknown, we all know it,\nlet’s continue enabling others to know\nit too.\nI am continuing the work here in\nthe U.K. with physically disabled, and\nI hope to raise money for a performance\nI have named “Skin”—since\ndancing with Nancy Stark Smith in\nPenrith I wish to focus on the “skin-\nesphere,” to discover it! With thanks\nto Steve Paxton and Anne Kilcoyne, I\nlook forward to crossing the Atlantic\nto meet you ‘guys.\" and those I met\nin Copenhagen. once more.",

    "Content": "DanceAbility is an integrated workshop\nin contact improvisation dance for\nphysically disabled and non-disabled\npeople. It is directed by Alito Alessi.\n\nThe 7th Annual DanceAbility\nWorkshop was held at the University\nof Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, March 4\nto 6, 1994. The workshop opened with\na lecture-demonstration on Friday evening,\nfollowed by two days of experiential\nworkshops and a performance on\nSaturday night.\nThis year’s project demonstrated\nincreased sophistication in staff organization\nand teaching methods. We attribute\nthis to a staff orientation meeting,\nwhere goals for the workshop, as well\nas an inner structure to facilitate achieving\nthose goals, were created.\nThis year’s staff was made up of\ndisabled and nondisabled teachers and\nperformers, including Alito Alessi, Emery\nBlackwell, Lori B, Bonnie Dunn,\nKumhee Hong, Bruce Jackson, Anne\nKilcoyne, Bill McKinlay, Karen Nelson\nand Steve Paxton. At the planning\nmeeting, the staff shared how they saw\ntheir individual work in reference to the\ndevelopment of the DanceAbility work\nas a whole. We decided what was\nnecessary to include in the workshop,\nand prepared a “menu” outlining the\nvarious exercises that would be included\nduring the workshops, and who would\nlead them.\nA significant component in the creation\nof the menu was to create a “web”\nof support that would extend throughout\nthe weekend. During the exercises, staff\nmembers who weren’t teaching acted as\n“satellites,” offering one-on-one instruction,\nexplaining exercises or facilitating\npeople’s explorations. The main task of\nthe “satellites” was to maintain and\ncontain the outer edges of the “web.”\nEach workshop session began and ended\nwith staff and participants forming a\ncircle, where thoughts, feelings and\nfeedback were shared.\nAlso included in this year’s staff\nwas a facilitator who was both involved\nin the project and acting as an “outside\nobserver.” The facilitator agreed to\nmake both an oral and written evaluation\nof the project at its completion.\nThe plan for the written report was that\nit solidify the vision of this work and\nmake it usable in future teaching efforts.\nWorkshop Sessions\nThe initial workshop circle included\nan introduction to and explanation of\nthe philosophy behind this work—\nbuilding common ground, creating\ncommunity, communicating and respecting\nlimits. Time was then provided for\npersonal introductions where people\ncould share information about themselves\nconcerning any physical, emotional\nor other limitations.\nAfter the opening circle, the morning\nconsisted of warm-ups involving\nspatial and sensory exploration. (Composer\nSuse Millimon provided live music\nduring Saturday and Sunday using a\nsynthesizer, guitar and drums.) After\nthe warm-ups, basic contact improvisation\nskills such as counterbalancing,\nfollowing the point of contact, and\nweight transfers were introduced The\nfirst session ended with guided open\ndancing and a closing circle.\nAfter lunch was another opening\ncircle, then an exercise incorporating\nsimple bodywork according to each\nindividual’s abilities. The suggested\nbodywork forms included rocking, pressure,\ncompression, rolling and stretching.\nThe rest of the afternoon included\nworking with various scores (such as\ndancing solos with people watching,\nthen replaying solos for each other),\nfollowed by a rather energetic round\nrobin and a closing circle.\nThis same “menu” was followed on\nSunday.\nThe DanceAbility Performance\nThis year’s DanceAbility Performance\nwas greatly expanded over last\nyear’s to showcase the continued\ngrowth and diversity of work in the\nfield of integrated dance. Besides\nshowcasing staff performers, the program\nincluded members of the San\nFrancisco-based AXIS Dance\nTroupe—Bonnie Lewkowicz, Thais\nMazur, David Russell, Uli Schmitz,\nLynelle Sjoberg and Judith Smith.\nOther performers included Bjo Ash-\nwill, lone Beauchamp, Karen Daly,\nNora Hajos, Dirk Poquestoferri, Wendy\nRuble and Gweneth Van Frank.\nThe performance included live\nmusic, original choreography, group\nimprovisations, duets, and solos. Karen\nNelson led an audience participation\nintermission event that used blindfolds,\nsound effects and touch to give the\naudience the chance to experience dance\non different sensory levels. The performance\nwas sign and audible-interpreted.\nNote: DanceAbility T-shirts are\navailable!",

    "Content": "The following interview took place\nat the Spring ’94 Breitenbush Jam Conference\non “Contact Improvisation: The\nForm,’’ at Breitenbush Hot Springs in\nOregon. The interview was conducted\nusing a score set up by the interviewee,\nSteve Paxton. Written questions were\ngiven to Steve, who sat in a small box at\none end of the space, out of our view.\nSteve responded in writing and each\nquestioner read to the conference their\nquestion and answer from Steve.\nWhile this was going on, the rest of\nthe people in the room participated in\nan energetic discussion on topics ranging\nfrom the varying styles of Contact\npracticed in various parts of the world\n(e.g., West Coast, East Coast, Germany,\nQuebec) to issues of economic accessibility\nand ethics and values within the\nContact community.\nThe weave of these two separate and\nrelated discussions was rich and engaging.\nI have taken the liberty of putting\nthe questions in an order, for they came\nto me in a pile. I did not credit individual\nquestioners (except in one case\nwhere it seemed relevant), because not\neveryone identified themselves on their\npapers.\n\nORIGINS / Cl\nWhat led you to invent the form we\ncall Contact Improvisation?\nSteve: Having noticed it (I did not\ninvent anything but the name and a\nprocess to study it), I noticed the form\nevolved. What do you mean by the\nform? A physical practice by individuals?\nDuets? The above evolved into a\nnetwork.\nWhat role does perception play in the\nform? Is Cl a state of mind? If so\ncan you define that state?\nEvery discipline begins with perception.\nStates of mind are caused by\nperceptions and/or states of mind determine\nperceptions.\nCl is an improvisational state of\nmind partially determined by another’s\nimprovisational state of mind; the contact\nis not a state of mind but a physical\nexterior event. The two blend like the\ndouble circles of ripples seen when two\nstones are dropped in a pond.\nDo you think Cl is evolving as a\nform? How?\nYes. 1. Socially inclusive. 2. Technically.\na) Why do you think people have\nsuch a longing/desire to do Cl?\nb) Do you think it’s possible that, by\npracticing Cl, the physical body\nchanges towards an addiction to\nphysical contact?\na) Touch is essential to development\nof the infant’s health, nurture, mental\ndevelopment, emotional maturing.\nMany people have not received enough,\nor continue to benefit from the way it\nworks on the adult body.\nb) “Addiction?” Are we addicted to\npreferring fresh air or healthy food?\nAre there books and tapes on contact\nimprovisation? What are they? How\ndo I get better?\nideas about what possible ways one\nmight aim practice. But the first part of\npractice is physical. The magazine\nContact Quarterly contains most info.\nIs there a difference between practice\nand discipline?\nNot in practice.\nYou said earlier that Cl is evolving\ntechnically... Could you elaborate,\ni.e., What specifically do you see as\ntechnical advancements? Do you\nteach this in duet work?\nI teach it in solo work and I will not\nelaborate on paper but only physically\nin the studio.\nHow do you feel about Cl being\n“used” in the new dance/post-modern\ndance field?\nWho cares?\nWould any other form of dance help\nwith the skills of Cl?\nAll.\nTHE SMALL DANCE\nWhat is the “Small Dance”?\nTuned to gravity, reflexes arrange\nour skeletons, aligning weights and\nproportions to maintain our stand.\nNoticing the Small Dance gives the\nmind a way to tune to the speed of\nreflex.\n\nAre all involuntary movements part\nof the Small Dance?\nMovements of the skeleton.\nIn the Small Dance, is the teetering\nupright equilibrium sought only a\nmechanical one of weights, levers and\nmuscle motors, or does the psyche\nalso attempt to find expression and\nrecognition of its own states in the\ntensing and releasing of the stander’s\nmusculature?\nThe small dance is only the first\ndefinition you give here. The second is\nthe study of such techniques as the\n“imagine you are taking a step with\nyour left foot...” sort. Separating these\ntwo is instructive. (My theory is that\nwe learn a lot by contrast.) In practice\nthey interact.\nAre breath and heartbeat a Small\nDance?\nThey are further, but other, manifestations\nof an aspect of mind to which\nconsciousness is denied direct access,\nyet may infer by such evidence.\nDid the “Small Dance” get created\nbefore Cl, the form, or after?\nBefore.\nWhat stage of your dance life were\nyou in then (what were you most\nbeing influenced by)?\n\nDance: Aikido, meditation, gymnastics,\nimprovisation technique, NY urban\ntension, art as abstract, “form” as principle\ncontrol, the work of Simone Forti, a\nremark by Agnes Martin—“The only\nthing left of nature in NYC is gravity.”\nIf there is a standing small dance, is\nthere a sitting small dance?\nYes, half as long.\nCan the Small Dance be refined? If\nso, what are die indicators?\nCreamy but fine-grained elastic\nscope of movement.\nI don’t know how to teach people to\nlet their small dance get bigger like\nmine. [This question came from Emery\nBlackwell, who has cerebral palsy.]\nYour example is contagious.\na) Dear dr. box, is there a difference\nbetween dance and movement?\nb) If so, if a person cannot feel their\nskeleton (paralysis or inattention) are\nthey still in the small dance?\na) Dame Peggy von Praugh reportedly\nsaid, “It is only dance if it is en\npointe. ”\nb) They are of it but not in it.\n\nFAITH IN THE FORM\n\nDo you ever lose faith in the form? If\nso, what have you done to find your\nway back?\nNo, I don’t lose faith in it, but I lose\nunderstanding of it sometimes. I clear\nmind and look again. Breitenbush\nhelps, also.\nIs Contact Improvisation a spiritual\npractice? If so, how can its principles\nmost effectively inform right relations\nin the world?\nAll dance is (due to momentary\nawareness). That is why the church\nkicked out dance as an accredited religious\nart. Whether or not it is spiritual—aside\nfrom that—it is a game which\nrequires two people to win. Extrapolate\nfrom that.\nWhat function does Cl serve in society\nat large?\nStarting in urban centers it replaces\nthe denatured physical life of the inhab-\nitants/inmates. Spreading outward, it\ninhabits a vacuum imposed by society’s\nvery real need to influence the physical\nbodies of its members; slips the knots\nof regimentation, releases directed focus\ninto peripheral, unknown, unknowable\nand familiar old potential. A form to\nre-identify touch in a manner so innocent\nand righteous that it can fairly\ntranscend taboo.\nWhat about metaphors...like for living?\nWhat about them?\nI realize the many many layers or\nlevels of occuring at the same time.\nLooking at details, i.e. Small Dance,\ndancing/process/improvising, i.e. giving\nweight is giving weight—giving\ncenter is giving self. Are you separate\nfrom me or part of my dream?\n\nThank you.",

    "Abstract": "This article summarizes a discussion about the values embedded within Contact Improvisation, particularly focusing on its historical context and the social changes occurring when the form emerged. The discussion highlights values such as inclusivity, the exploration of touch as communication, and the establishment of an unwritten contract to prevent abuse of intimacy. It also addresses the complexities of sensuality and sexuality within the practice and the potential for denial within the community.",
    "Content": "Last March I attended the 12th annual Contact\nImprovisation Jam held at Breitenbush Hot Springs in\nOregon. Following the jam was a conference dedicated to\nboth a physical and verbal discussion of “Contact Improvisation:\nThe Form” led by Karen Nelson. The “small dance,”\nthe physics of contact, teaching contact to high need youth,\nand a discussion on the embedded values in Contact Improvisation\nwere among some of the topics explored.\nThe following report was gleaned from a transcript of the\ndiscussion on values led by Lori B. Participants in the\ndiscussion included, among others, Lori B, Brad Rothbart,\nlone Beauchamp, Steve Paxton, Mary Ganzon, Libby Witzel\nand myself.\nLori began the discussion with this thought:\n“I experience some set of values every time a\ncommunity gathers to practice the form. There are\nsome remarkable similarities in people who get drawn\nto practice the form and I think there are actually\nsome political values, maybe not intended to be a\nfundamental part of the form, but that have somehow\nbecome embedded in the form... As an example, I\nwould give the idea of inclusiveness... ”\nStarting from this point, we proceeded to examine Contact\nfrom a variety of perspectives, the first one historical. When\nSteve Paxton invented(?) discovered(?) recovered(?) uncov-\nered(?) delivered(?) Contact Improvisation in the early 1970s,\nour country was in a period of social unrest and change.\nThis manifested in a number of trends. Among them was the\nchallenging of dominant social values and sex, race and class\ninequalities.\nDuring this period, ideologies around touch were also\nchanging. Touch and the sensuality of touch were explored\nas means of communication, not simply the prelude to a\nsexual act. Contact Improvisation explored this territory of\ntouch communication directly. In our discussion, it was\nstated that in Cl “successful” communication through touch\nrequired that the dancers enter\n“a listening state, listening to the self and to another\nperson on a deep, subtle level ” (lone Beauchamp)\nThis listening state was in sharp contrast to the presentational\nfocus of most western theatrical dance. A listening\nstate was achieved by having the dancers slow down their\nmovements in order to take an internal focus.\n\"Rightfrom the beginning there nus a commitment to\nexplore the internal life of the body... * (Steve Paxton)\nDancing from the listening state created an unusual type\nof short-term intimacy between the lived, danced, physical\nbody and someone or something outside the body.\n\"In the form there is u degree that you are intimate\nbecause you are letting someone into a certain\nspace...and you let down by letting it be slow and not\nbeing afraid of that. ” (Mary Ganzon)\nAlong with the freedom to touch and be intimate came an\nagreement, an unwritten contract, which stated that the\nprivilege to touch would not be abused. (Abuse might\nconsist of using the dance for seductive and/or masturbatory\npurposes.)\nThere was a great deal of disagreement in the group about\nsimilarities and differences between a sensual experience and\na sexual one. Using a broad definition of sensuality, a\nsensual experience might be had with another dancer, but\ncould also be experienced when dancing alone or with the\nfloor. Some felt that the individual could choose to be\nsensual without being sexual.\n“You sense your bones, you sense your muscles, you\nsense sexual feelings and you choose where to place\nyour focus. ” (Carol Horwitz)\nHowever, regardless of the intention of Contact teachers\nand dancers, in the practice of Cl sexual feelings do occur.\nThese feelings may not get addressed within the Contact\ncommunity, which can result in an unhealthy atmosphere of\ndenial.\nContact was discussed as a sport/game. Rather than the\ntypical win/lose situation of sports, Contact was seen as a\ngame where “it takes two people to win” (Steve).\nIt was agreed that inclusivity was a primary Contact\nvalue. Contact can be done with any BODY. A Contact\ndance arises from the meeting point, the ’’common ground,”\nbetween any two bodies regardless of their dance experience,\nsize, shape, sex, race or ablebodiedness.\nIt was also suggested that among Contact dancers there\nwas a “commitment to process” (Carol). Process takes place\nin ‘biological” or “organic” time (Carol) or “erotic” time\n(Lori) which is distinctly different from and often significantly\nslower than linear clock time. The Contact dance moves\nand matures at its own pace.\nMany agreed that Contact put you in touch with your\n“physical self and physical strength” in a way that other\nmovement forms did not. “The being in the body for me was\nthis elemental thing, central...,” someone added.\nContact’s power to integrate various parts of oneself was\nrecognized as a valuable result of practicing the form. For\nmany this integrated state was considered healing.\nInclusivity, an embracing of new social values that\nemerged in the ’60s and '70s, openness to the intimacy of\ntouch, willingness to move slowly (or fast!) and listen,\nrespect for the Contact dance contract, physicality, noncompetitiveness,\nprocess orientation and integrative and\nhealing potential were some of the values which we identified\nas components of Contact I welcome additional thoughts\nand feelings on the subject. These ideas and others from the\nContact community are forming the basis of my dissertation.",

    "Abstract": "This article recounts Nancy Stark Smith's experience collaborating with dancers from diverse styles to create a performance piece. It highlights the challenges and discoveries of integrating Contact Improvisation with traditional dance forms like ballet, exploring how different movement vocabularies can interact and influence each other within a community context. The piece reflects on the potential for cross-disciplinary exchange and the creation of hybrid dance forms.",
    "Content": "The invitation from my local arts\ncouncil was to come together with a\ngroup of local professional dancers to\ncollaborate, under the direction of a\npostmodern choreographer, on the making\nof a piece, to be performed in eight\nweeks time on the stage of a beautiful\nold theatre in town.\nThere were about seventeen of us in\nall. Directors of companies and/or longstanding\nteachers and performers, each\nof us represented a different style of\ndance practiced here in the “Pioneer\nValley” of western Mass.: tango,\nmodem, salsa, African, jazz, classical\nCambodian, ballet, contact improvisation,\nbelly dance, show dance, butoh,\nintergenerational postmodern, and tap.\nThe idea was that we would share material\nfrom our dance forms and from this\nexchange a dance would be made.\nI know that Contact and many other\nnew movement practices are not common\nfare to the majority of dancegoers.\nBut through these weeks of rehearsal I\ncame to experience just how the work I\ndo deviates from traditional dance\nforms: the spherical spacial orientation\n(sometimes dancing inverted, any part of\nthe body touching the floor or partner),\nthe focus on touch as the central vehicle\nfor the dance form, the value given to\nspontaneous invention and play, the\nsense of extending your balance beyond\nyour own axis into a shared sphere of\naction and support with a partner.\nWhat could I communicate of contact\nimprovisation in this context? In the\nfirst session of our small exchange\ngroup, after showing some photos, talking\na little, and demonstrating my solo\nuse of weight (falling, rolling, inverting,\nworking off-balance), I thought why not\njust start, improvise through touch,\nweight, and movement, without further\npreparation or explanation?\nMy first dance was with Gail, the\nballet teacher, and it consisted of her\ncranking me mercilessly (I loved it) like\na plastic ballerina on top of an alarm\nclock, in what she identified as “finger\nturns,” me following, trying to keep up\nwith her touch and direction.\nNext, I tried a back-to-back contact\ndance with her, just a little easy leaning,\nto get the weight blend that might serve\nas ground for further exploring. The\nmoment she relaxed and gave weight,\nshe pulled away, excited, exclaiming,\n“It’s therapeutic; Contact is therapeutic!”\nIf relaxation is therapeutic, then\nyes, Contact is therapeutic. Does that\nmean it’s not also dancing? We went\non... With her ballet shoes slipping on\nthe unrosined “modem dance” studio\nfloor, our first contact improvisation\nwas somewhat comical, frustratingly\nfragmented and superficial, but a start.\nAt one point, the directors began\nguiding us through exploratory amalgams:\ntry the Cambodian walk with the\nbutoh towel-carrying arms. Start with\nthe “contact” head reaching through the\nsphere, and let that circling drop\nthrough the body into the belly dance\nhip circles, etc.\nIn rehearsal one day, we came up\nwith our own amalgam form. The\nrules of the dance were that both dancers\nwould attempt to stay within then-\nrespective forms and dance together.\nThe resulting hybrid dances were, well,\nbizarre, and very exciting to me.\nWhen Gail volunteered to dance with\nme, remembering our first finger turn\ndance, I was curious what would happen.\nTo make and sustain physical\ncontact with her as she whirled around\nher axis, merrily improvising ballet\ncombinations through the space, was no\neasy task. I quickened my pace to keep\nmy body within range of her, to touch,\nbrush, jump past, fall in front of, synchronize\nwith her dancing. Finally she\nbegan to seek me out too—or at least\nconsciously keep herself within my\nreach—presenting me with her pirouettes\nand waltz steps, her pique arabesques\nand pas de bourses, as if to\nsee what I might do with them. I eventually\nmanaged to dance my way into\nher sphere and, feeling a lift coming—a\nnatural and easy extension -of the flow\nof movement we were engaged in—I\nsignalled her through touch, and took\nher up. In past weeks she probably\nwould have stiffened, but this time, her\neyes rolled back in her head, her head\nfell back and she let me have her; legs\nstill extended, toes pointed, she flew\nlike an angel draped over a cloud.\n“That was fun!” she exclaimed afterwards.\n“But you know,” she confided\nto me, “next time I think I’ll take more\nresponsibility.” Maybe Contact teaches\nitself.\nAs I put myself in the hands of the\nteachers, entered the body of then-\nforms, I felt I was travelling: to the\ncourts of Europe where one danced to\nplease the king, to Asia, dancing to\nhonor the Gods.\nPopping through the kinesphere of\nmy own small dance community into a\nlarger world of dancers was refreshing.\nI felt carried in a kind of Noah’s Ark of\ndance to a simple place where various\nforms co-exist in the same garden; the\ndifferent species, life forms, cross-\npollinating where attracted to each\nother, nevertheless remaining distinct.\nA United Nations of dance, with no\nneed for headsets; understanding one\nmovement language made them all\nintelligible, if unpronounceable.\nThe final piece was a series of ‘features’\nin which dancers performed then-\ndance style on its own amidst a variety\npf mixed-dance-language backgrounds,\nstage crossings, and transitions to the\nnext feature. It was a real pleasure to\nperform a straight-forward full-tilt contact\nimprovisation with a skilled and\nsensitive partner, Stephen Yoshen, in a\ncrazy quilt piece made to be accessible\nto a large general audience in my\nhometown.\nI think the arts council did me a big\nfavor. The project put news into my\nbody, showed me as I am, and gave me\nthe opportunity to consider what I’m\ndoing and how it meets other kinds of\ndancing. It gave me an intimate experience\nof other dance forms and the\nworking processes of the remarkable\ndancers who do them.",

The\nlatter were sparsely attended, but consistently\nso by the same interested\nindividuals, all of whom, in response\nto the changing dance environment,\nwere facing crises about whether to\ncontinue to dance, and if so how.\nOften, as the afternoon sun worked its\nway through the room in surprising\nand beautiful ways, we fell to talking\ninstead of doing, about what dancing\nhad meant to us, could we get along\nwithout it.\nInspired by their despair, I made\nDisappearances. We worked in the\nstudio several weeks looking for the\nthreshold between what one could do\non the street that would remain invisible,\nand what one might do that would\ncross that threshold and catch a passerby’s\neye. Armed with our degrees of\nvisibility, and rules about how to respond\nto situations we guessed might\ncome up as we walked the line between\nperformance and non-performance,\nwe took the work to two places\nI’ve long thought suitable for open-air\nwork, the expanse on lower Broadway\nnext to the Marine Midland Bank,\nwhere a twelve-foot high orange cube\na block east, the plaza in front of the\nChase Manhattan Bank, where an\neighteen-foot tall Dubuffet, read by\nmost as “mushroom-like,” or at least\n“organic,” breaks with curves the\nredundant right angles of the surrounding\narchitecture. Our plan was\nto spend half an hour in the first\nspace, where most of the pedestrians\nare moving through, the city’s quick\npace at full throttle, the second half\nhour in the second, less a pathway,\nmore a retreat, where people stop to\nsun, to eat a sandwich, to rest in the\nsatisfying expanse of the raised plaza,\naway from the streets’ tumult.\nDay one, stepping from the bus’s\nfrigid air into Manhattan’s summer\nheat and humidity, I was alarmed to\nsee a guy in the first of the two spaces\nalready working the lunchtime crowd\nwith his dog. Sit, stand on your hind\nlegs, run a circle and come back, lie\nsupine and let this lady rub your belly.\nHow, with our delicate material, are\nwe going to compete with this, to\nmyself with knitted brow I moaned.\nBut quickly I recalled the spirit of our\nwork, and realized that this more conventional\nperformance suggested simply\nthat we adjust upward our threshold\nof visibility. Eight of us or so\nstood in one or another of our somewhat\nrealistic, somewhat stylized\nposes against the windowed wall of\nthe bank, falling in and out of unison\nas chance and choice would have it,\nso that for the semi-circle of tourists\nand lunch-breakers who had established\nthemselves as viewers of the\ncanine spectacle, we became an upstage,\noff-hand corps de ballet.\nIt’s the kind of performing after\nwhich you want to talk to your fellow\ndancers in order to confirm your experience,\nto verify fleeting impressions.\nDid anyone else see the bank guard’s\nface go from neutral to oh!, and feel\nthe same relief as he made no move to\nstop us? Does anyone know the\nyoung guy who joined in and gave off\na Hey-I-know-what-you ’re-doing-and-\nI-can-do-it-better attitude? Did you\ntoo tone down your material to point\nup his arrogance without squelching\nhis participatory spirit?\nOn our last day a woman in black\nwas buzzing about, alternately taking\npictures and looking perplexed. A\ndancer or two had asked if I knew her,\nI didn’t, and said they had done what\nwe agreed, lied about our activity,\ndenying, when she asked them, that\nwe were performing. “No, my friends\nand I work in the building right over\nthere, and we like to exercise on our\nlunch hour.”\nSuddenly I remembered that a\nnewspaperman had called asking about\nthe location of the event, unspecified\non the postcard advertising it. (As I\nwas not sure we wouldn’t, as we\nincreased our visibility from day to\nday, be asked by security officers to\nleave our chosen spaces, the card\nasked that those who wanted to watch\ncall for our daily whereabouts. Also,\nwhile not wishing to exclude friends\nand fans, I didn’t want to attract in\nnumbers customary dance audience, as\nthe piece was for and about pedestrians\nfree from performance expectations,\nand too much focused attention\nwas sure to blow our cover. We\naveraged half a dozen intentional\nviewers a show, some of whom, despite\nmy requests to the contrary,\ninsisted on approaching to converse.\nA few blessed days we danced for the\nunsuspecting only.)\nI approached the lady in black and\nwith chagrin confirmed my suspicion.\nShe was frustrated, ready to blow.\nShe had been down the day before as\nwell, had seen nothing she thought to\nbe dancing, had gone back to her boss\nwho said No, you must return, look\nagain...then the dancers lying to her.\nPart of her Leica began to look like a\nsilencer. To make amends, and, as it\nwas the end of the last day’s hour, to\ngive up with impunity our relative\ninvisibility, we performed for her in\nunison our least reticent material, and\nhope some day to see ourselves, dancers\ngently disappearing into the black\nhole of a Wall Street lunch hour, immortalized\non the pages of the Village\nVoice. (I was told there might be\ncoverage next Spring in an article\nfeaturing street dance.)\nTo jump back to May. For a week\nof that splendid month, within eye and\nnose shot of the fresh blossoms of\nWashington Square Park, New York\nUniversity held a week-long conference\non the Beat Generation. That\ndance is often excluded from lists of\nthe arts is a fact that makes some\nmovers who read sad... But, historically\nspeaking, Beat Dance there wasn’t.\nNone. So you wouldn’t expect the\nconference to embrace such a category.\nMoreover, during those seminal ‘50s,\njust thirty miles south of North Beach,\nI was being a proper student in a proper\nhigh school. After sitting, full of\nunexpressed yearning, through long\nmornings in desk-chairs, I would move\nthrough the afternoons, not along the\nroad, but toward the hoop, the net, the\ngoal. So my participation in this unlikely\nevent was itself equally unlikely.\nAs for the inclusion of the category,\neveryone knows that the ball parks of\nacademia constructed in the last few\ndecades are missing left fields. That\nis, no safe havens for omissions are\nprovided. (Or maybe it’s the entire\nball park that’s missing and we’re all\nin left field.) The point is, someone\nmust have demanded equal time and\ngotten it. And as for my presence at\nthe event, pure nepotism. So I found\nmyself sitting in the back of a jam-\npacked Loeb Student Center abashedly\nrehearsing un-hip thoughts for the Beat\nDance Panel while listening to half a\ndozen professors of both genders and\nmany colors draw parallels between\nBiblical and Beat literature. Fascinating,\nand light years away in spirit from\nPlanet Beat.\nAs they concluded, and we mounted\nthe stage, the hall began to empty\nout. Before, several hundred, now,\nmaybe twenty. Judith Malina, Living\nTheater dynamo, described demonstrating\nthat very morning in Times Square\nagainst the death penalty. Jean Erd-\nman showed a video of an early solo,\nexquisitely flowing. As our hour\nneared its end, the hall began to fill\nonce again, in anticipation of the next\n(non-dance) panel. I couldn’t help but\ncomment, then and there, through the\nmicrophone, to all of them, the enthu-\nsiasts who had listened to us, and the\nnoisy arrivals, not angrily, more in\nbemusement, on the symbolism of this\naudience ebb and flow. I confined\nmyself to a description of what I saw,\nthe outflow for dance, the inflow for\nwords, but was thinking old thoughts:\nIs dance the too difficult art? Or the\ntoo simple? Too material? Less\ntranslatable even than music to our\nverbal confidence? That I voiced\nwhat was obvious to all the panelists\npleased both our moderator, Joanna\nHarris, master dance lover, teacher and\nknower from Berkeley, and immediate\ncause of my being there, and Miriam\nBerger, head of Dance Education at\nNYU, who a few months later offered\nme a job teaching in her department.\nTo hang out one’s shingle is one\nthing. Those who come to study have\nchosen you from among other available\nteachers, and are therefore fully\nmotivated. In the academy it’s another\nstory. Students may or may not\nwant dancing as a career, may or may\nnot consider you the right influence.\nWednesday evenings September\nthrough December I spent three hours\nwith fifteen graduate students seeking\ndegrees that will help them get teaching\njobs in dance. The class was\nbilled as Improvisation, a word I eschew\nas too loose for use. I was\nnervous. By the end of the first class,\nthe challenge I expected, could I win\nthem, had been reversed, they had\nwon me. The better I got at walking\nthrough the warm fall afternoons the\nfifteen minutes to 35 West 4th Street\nwithout trying to plan something other\nthan what had already been on my\nbody/mind as I had left my studio and\nmy own work process, the more fully\nthe class responded, and the more I\nrealized how much I was learning\nfrom this experience with them.\nExample: I spent one class working\non rhythm, insisting that they\nmake visible in their bodies meters\nthey had invented clapping, not as\neasy a task as one might suppose.\nFocusing on this skill in the class\ntempted me to look again at the workings\nof imagined and realized rhythms\nin my own steps, and I decided to\nfocus on this element in the dance I\nwas making. I like to put my body in\nmotion and through trial and error find\na rhythm. Sometimes I sing, or count,\nthe aural structure acting as a grid\nagainst which the moves take shape.\nThis double layer of information facilitates\nremembering the movement and\ncommunicating it to another dancer.\nAs I paid closer attention to the process,\nI found there were notes in my\ninner singing not in fact represented in\nthe movement. I stop, analyze, move\nagain, insisting on complete expression\nof the sung rhythm. Sometimes a\nblight, here stubbornness bears fruit in\nthe form of turns of phrase I otherwise\nwould not have come upon.\nThe piece I’m talking about, Caracole,\nwill be missing quite a few beats\nif I don’t stop writing this letter and\ngo upstairs to the studio...\nMy happiest wishes to you for the\ncoming year.",

    "Content": "A version of this letter was first printed in\nthe Movement Research Performance Journal\n#10, winter!spring 1995, NYC.\nWhat is IMPROVISATION? What\nare people doing when they improvise?\nWhat am I doing when I watch an\nimprovised performance or any performance\nfor that matter? These are questions\nI found myself pondering during\nand after attending a slew of improvised\nperformances hosted by the Third\nImprovisation Festival/NY this past\nDecember ’94.\nMy experience as an audience varied\nwidely with the viewing of different\nworks. -I have attempted to understand\nhow my perceptions and feelings relate\nto the nature of each artist’s process. In\ndoing this I am making assumptions\nwhich admittedly are personal, screened\nthrough more than twenty years of experience\nas an improviser. I’ve practiced\nContact Improvisation since 1972. I\nhave experimented with many approaches\nto collaborative, ensemble work, and\nI have a long term interest in developing\nimprovisation as a compositional medium\nfor making performance.\nOften, during this festival, I felt an\nempathy with the performers, a recognition\nof various experiences one can have\nwhile performing improvisation. I perceived\ndifferent types of work at various\npoints of development and maturity.\nAbove all I felt my own preferences\nvery strongly.\nThere were artists who appeared to\nbe in the midst of finding their work,\nsearching for a clear formulation of a\nquestion. They were attempting to\nidentify a knowable field, a way of\nworking that resonates with their interests.\nI felt Group 6 and perhaps Teri\nCarter/Ione Beauchamp and group,\npresented work at this stage of development\nThe nature of each of their improvisations\nwas complex. I perceived\na dual activity in the performer of both\nsearching for material, as well as improvising\nwithin the material. There was\nan underlying activity of scanning for a\nway to enter, inhabit, embody, and\nmaintain “the work,” superimposed over\nthe more immediate involvement with\nthe physical work itself.\nI can identify particularly with\nGroup 6 (Chris Aiken, Peter Bingham,\nJeff Bliss, Julie Carr, Ray Chung, Nancy\nStark Smith), a distillation of the\noriginal group of eighteen of which I\nwas a part, that met during the first\nImprovisation Festival/NY three years\nago.\nMost of the members of Group 6\nare expert practitioners of Contact Improvisation.\nYet it appeared that they\nwere not interested in performing Contact\nImprovisation. I was not exactly\nclear what they were working on. I\ncould see they had an interest in mapping\nimages in space. They exercised a\nsense of spatial design. They were\nsensitive to the difference between\nimages that inhabit one part of the\nspace and images that move through the\nspace, to foreground and background.\nThey were polite in their use of space,\ndeferring to each other or waiting for an\nopening. I felt their politeness often\narose from an instinct to avoid cluttering\nthe space too much rather than a\nplay with space as an expressive element.\nI also gathered from conversations\nwith a member of Group 6 that\nthere was an interest in integrating\nContact Improvisation with “image\nwork.” I’m not sure what is meant by\n“image work,” but I saw performers\nworking with repeating movements,\nholding particular movement states,\nworking with facial expression, attitude,\nand posturing, mixed in with Contact\nImprovisation material.\nIn Group 6, there were brief moments\nof pure Contact Improvisation,\ntwo bodies engaged in a responsive and\nsensory physical dialogue. Jeff Bliss\nand Nancy Stark Smith did a short\npurely Contact Improvisation duet in\ntheir first concert at the DIA Center for\nthe Arts. This duet was complex and\nfast, and was clearly felt by the body\nfirst and then perceived by the mind\nThis is distinct, in my mind, from using\ncontact vocabulary to create movement\nimages. For example, in one part of the\nsame performance at DIA, Chris Aiken\nwas spinning with someone up on his\nshoulders and carried this person around\nthe space for quite a long time. I registered\nthis as a decision to sustain a\nfixed image rather than a moment of\nContact Improvisation. Even though the\nmovement material was drawn from\nContact Improvisation and in this case\nthe dancers were in a moment of improvisation,\nthe motivation underlying the\nchoice to prolong spinning came from a\ncompositional idea outside the parameters\nof the focus of a contact duet.\nI wondered about a potential problem\nin trying to integrate two or more\ndistinct ways of working. This approach\nmay set up a horizontal exploration,\nleaving the work lingering on the\nsurface of various subjects rather than\ndelving into any one in particular.\nWhile watching Group 6, I found I\nwas spending at least as much time\nmonitoring the performers’ struggle to\nfind material and negotiate the compositional\npriorities of their physical images\nas I was taking a ride on what they\nwere making. I felt a tremendous\namount of restraint within the perform-\ners, and I wasn’t sure why. In attempting\nto honor a working process that\nappeared to be not clearly understood,\nthey put themselves in a kind of confusion\nwhich was almost cellular—physically,\ntheir bodies were withholding.\nAs I watched, I imagined what I might\ndo to release myself, recalling alternate\nways of using my eyes or feeling space\nwith my body. My frustration rose with\nthe thought that their situation was, on\nsome level, hopeless. Without the glue\nof a clear common working process no\none individual in a collaboration can\neffectively change the overall composition.\nNew elements can be added but\nthe essential mix tends to remain the\nsame.\nOne definition of improvisation\n(mentioned by Jennifer Monson during\nthe Studies Project at Judson Church\nduring the festival), is a focus on the\nprocess of making choices. In performance,\nit offers the opportunity to see\nperformers in the act of composing, of\nresponding to something. The question\nis, responding to what? It is confusing\nto give oneself the task of making a\nchoice, or formulating a response, when\nthere is no clear subject matter with\nwhich to relate.\nIn my mind the action of composing\nimplies there is some underlying way of\nworking which becomes one’s subject,\none’s language, and informs a process\nof manipulating elements relative to that\nsubject. Without a subject there is no\nleverage. It is too late to begin clarifying\none’s subject while performing.\nThis left me with a lack of interest and\na low level of engagement watching\nGroup 6. Perhaps my personal interest\nis in setting up a working situation in\nwhich there is someplace to go, while\nother people may be interested in a state\nof being in which there is no place to\ngo but “now.”\nTeri Carter & lone Beauchamp\ndirected a large group with the intention\nof doing Contact Improvisation. They\nperformed on the final day of the festival.\nThey did not present the work as a\nduet form, but neither did they attempt\nto make a highly intentional ensemble\ncomposition. They had an inherent trust\nin the spatial composition created by\ncouples doing Contact Improvisation\nspontaneously—beginning, ending, and\nexchanging partners at various times.\nThis group had one quality that was\nrefreshing. I saw them extend their\nvision and communicate with each other\nthrough space in a very ordinary but\nphysical way. I saw one performer see\nanother performer across the space,\nrecognize a desire to come together, and\nmove to touch. That simple and palpable\nprogression was very easy to watch.\nI realized this kind of simple sensory\ncommunication was often unavailable to\nthe performers in Group 6.\nThere were artists in the festival\nwho used the occasion to perform\nquickly constructed improvisational\nscores, or improvisations with open\nscores. The group pulled together by\nAndrew Harwood, consisting of Andrew,\nSteve Krieckhaus, Sondra Loring,\nKirstie Simson, and musicians, and\nAlexis Eupierre’s solo performance at\nJudson Church were performances of\nthis kind. The experience of watching\nthese performances was unpredictable,\nand not dissimilar to watching jams\nexcept for the energy added into the\nmix by having an audience.\nAlexis explained in the Studies\nProject discussion after his performance,\nthat he had decided to enter the performance\nspace with no score, completely\nempty, that he had never tried this\nbefore, and that this was his interest at\nthe moment. During Alexis’s performance,\nit was obvious that he was\nstruggling, and dealing with sensations\nthat were new and unfamiliar. Yet, he\ndid not have a lot of devices for covering\nup his vulnerability, and so he\nseemed really on an edge. I witnessed\nhim thread his way through his own\nexperience in a very open way. I perceived\nthe audience as very kind, open,\nand observant I recognized that Alexis\nhad the clear desire to have an experience\nin public.\nI felt very different watching Andrew\nHarwood’s group. It was clear\nthis group was working in a very open\nor loosely scored way. I felt their motivation\nto perform, like Alexis’s, came\nfrom a desire to “have an experience in\npublic.” However, most of those performers\nhave a lot of experience performing\nimprovisational work, it is not\nan edge for them to improvise in front\nof an audience; they have a wealth of\nextraordinary and virtuosic skills. I\nexpected more from their performance\nwork.\nThe ground created by the work of\nthis group was highly quixotic and I\nhad trouble relaxing and trusting the\nperformers. My experience varied\nwidely from being surprised by moments\nof extraordinary dancing and\nincongruous images to watching cheap\ngimmicks and virtuosity in search of\naudience approval. I found it painful\nwhen one member of the ensemble\nupstaged another or to witness a performer\nexposing themselves in ways\nthey were unaware.\nSteve Krieckhaus is someone I was\nlooking forward to watching. I’d seen\nhim improvise a few years ago and he\nhad a very developed dialogue with his\nown movement. He was practically\ninvisible in the performances of\nAndrew’s group. You could say, that\nwas his problem, he just didn’t come\nout; but I’m not interested in watching\nsomeone fight for visibility. None of\nthe other performers seemed to be able\nto give him any space, and that disturbed\nme. Andrew and Kirstie’s large\nand incredible dancing dominated my\nattention.\nAt one point I made a shift to track\nSteve, and I saw a whole other performance.\nSteve was out there trying to\nfigure out what to do, to look and see,\nand feel the space. He was remarkably\nquiet. At one point in their final performance\nat the University Settlement\nHouse, he did have a short solo. He\nwas getting into his work and drifted\nover towards Andrew. It was perceived\nit was. Andrew walked out as if he was\nan eraser and, moving across the floor\nwith a kind of insensitivity or bullishness,\nwiped Steve off the space.\nThat is how I saw it. I was disappointed;\nit is not pleasant for me to read\na performance event on this level. I\nlook forward to having my imagination\nstimulated, my perceptions altered—to\nlearning something, not to seeing personal\ndynamics and politics between\nperformers vying for space or using\neverything they know to make theater\nout of their vulnerability.\nThere was other work in the festival\nwhere none of these considerations\nmattered. There were artists whose\nperformance was based in a practice\nthat was quite defined, known, and\ndeveloped. These works were improvised\nwithin a limited and knowable\nfield of parameters. I felt that, to name\na few, Zeena Parkins, who improvised\non an electronic harp, Kurtis Lamkin, a\npoet who delivered his written poems\nwithin an improvised conversation with\nthe audience, and Image Lab (K.J.\nHolmes, Karen Nelson, Lisa Nelson,\nand Scott Smith), who worked within a\nspecific and well-rehearsed ensemble\nscore, presented work of this nature.\nThey manipulated parameters on the fly,\nwith a sense of having explored the\nterritory. There was a sensitivity to the\ncompositional ramifications of their\nchoices. They had the instrument and\nthey knew how to play. As an audience,\nI felt spoken to, directly addressed.\nI found my imagination and\nsenses engaged as I tuned into the language\nor world evoked by the performance\npiece.\nI couldn’t remember when I’d last\nheard Zeena Parkins play. As I listened,\nI was learning how she was listening. I\nhad the time to get in tune with her,\nbecause she was busy with her process\nof making music, and she stayed with it.\nThis is the kind of experience I look\nforward to both in my own process of\nmaking and showing work as well as\nwhen I watch performance. I was altering\nmy perceptions and going somewhere.\nThe Improvisation Festival/NY establishes\na frame. Any work that is\nincluded in it is contributing to an overview\nthat is, to some extent, defining or\nrevealing the current state of improvisation\nin performance. Yet, though the\ntitle Improvisation Festival indicates a\ndiscerning sense, or curatorial choice to\nhighlight a particular genre or medium\nof expression, I felt the artistic vision or\nmission of the festival needed to be\nclarified and made public.\nImprovisation is a marginalized form\nwithin the field of dance, an already\nmarginalized art form. My hope is that\nan improvisation festival could provide\nsome leverage to further the visibility of\ngood improvisation and to consciously\neducate the participants and public alike.\nThe field of improvisation contains\nseveral sophisticated, developed and\nprofound movement forms and systems\nof exploration. Yet for those who do\nnot know this, I fear the nature of a\nfestival of this kind is such that they\ncould come away without this knowledge.\nI think it is important to find\nways of being supportive by being critical,\nand my hope in writing this is to\nstimulate more dialogue about the work\nand the forms in which it can be presented.\nI would like to thank Movement\nResearch and especially Julie Carr and\nSondra Loring for all their hard work in\ncreating and curating the Improvisation\nFestival/NY. We do have a frame for\nfurther dialogue.",

They outline the festival's evolution, emphasizing its aim to foster community, showcase diverse improvisational forms, and promote dialogue among artists from various disciplines and geographic locations.

    "Content": "with Sondra Loring\nAs curators of the Improvisation\nFestival/NY, Sondra Loring and I would\nlike to respond to Danny Lepkoff’s\nletter (in Movement Research Performance\nJournal #10, and this issue of\nCQ)t and to requests made by others to\nexplain our criteria for curation. We are\ngrateful for the questions and comments\nwe have received over the festival’s\nthree-year span, and are happy to take\nthis opportunity to discuss the goals,\nhopes and values of the festival.\nA Brief History\nAt the time of the festival’s conception\nin 1991,1 was particularly interested\nin how an artist’s environment affects\nwhat they make and how they\nwork. I was specifically looking at how\nan intensely urban environment might\naffect dance-making and the relationship\nof the dancer to the body. I was also\ncurious about the various sensibilities or\nvalue systems which might emerge from\nnon-urban backdrops. I did not, and\nstill do not, assume that all work stemming\nfrom a particular place necessarily\nconforms to a particular set of stylistic\nor contextual concerns, but I continue to\nbe interested in bringing this question to\nlight.\nThe idea for the first Improvisation\nFestival/NY developed partially from\nthis inquiry. That year, a group of\neighteen improvisers were brought together\nto work every day and to perform\nthree times at the end of a week. About\nhalf were from New York and the others\nfrom Canada, Western Massachusetts,\nCalifornia, Minneapolis, Boston,\nSeattle, etc. All shared some familiarity\nwith Contact Improvisation, probably\nbecause this was my home territory and\nso most of the people I knew had\nworked with this material. There was,\nhowever, no definite assumption that we\nwould be doing contact, or exclusively\ncontact, together. Sondra and I did not\nknow what would happen, but were very\ninterested in the experiment.\nA lot was learned from this first\nrun. Mostly we heard requests that a\nsmaller group be formed and that people\nbe given opportunities to show then-\nown more developed work as well. So,\nas interest and energy were available,\nand as Movement Research continued\ntheir support of the project, Sondra and\nI jumped at the bait and formed the\nSecond Annual Improvisation Festival/NY\nwhich was exponentially larger\nand more inclusive than the first The\nfestival then took on the form of a\nshowcase, highlighting many artists’\nwork and stretching to include visual\nand video artists, poets, Action Theater\nperformers, and musicians as well as\ndancers. The initial “contact group”\nwas reformed with some variation and\nwith less people. More workshops were\nadded. We wanted the festival to be\nlarge and unwieldy, and imagined it to\nhave qualities of a circus or parade.\nWe hoped the fullness of the event\nwould carry with it an excitement and a\nsense of cohesion and community. We\ndid want to curate “good” shows, to\nprovide space for local and non-local\nartists to really do what they do, as well\nas to leave room for some surprises.\nThere was no stated “theme” for the\nfestival other than that the work be\nimprovisational.\nSome months after the second festival,\nSondra and I invited a diverse\ngroup of improvisers together to discuss\npossibilities for the future. We took\nideas and tried to model the third year\nafter some of the suggestions that arose.\nStructurally, year three basically followed\nin the footsteps of year two,\nthough we added more workshops\n(five), and the roster of performers grew\nto include more out-of-towners from\nfarther away and more artists from other\ndisciplines and backgrounds.\nFestival Goals and Values\nThe festival aims to promote the\ndiscussion, presentation and study of\nimprovisation as a performance form in\na wide range of disciplines.\nWe hope to bring people together in\na way that is minimally competitive but\nthat does allow artists to show their\ninterests, their current studies, their\nexpertise or their curiosities. It is not\nof interest to either Sondra or I to curate\nonly work that is at its most developed\nstages, or to curate only artists\nwho have already established their deep\nconnection to their material or partners.\nIt is of interest instead to show the\nvarious stages of development which\ncan exist in improvisation and still\nmake for interesting and sometimes\nvery exciting performance.\nWhen I was first witnessing performances\nof improvisation, I was\nthrilled simply by the exposure of the\nperformer’s mind in action. Often the\nperformers I watched were able to respond\nto their internal and external\nenvironments in ways that seemed quite\nskillful, conscious, and controlled, and\nthis ability revealed their proficiency\nand experience. But at the same time,\nI often perceived the unconscious, intuitive\nand impulsive responses at work,\nand so felt that something was exposed\nabout the performer which perhaps was\nnot in their pocket, so to speak; not\nwhat they meant to show, but what they\ncould not help showing.\nIn the dancing of the people I was\nwatching at that time (Steve Paxton,\nNancy Stark Smith, Karen Nelson, Alito\nAlessi, K.J. Holmes, Andrew Harwood,\nSteve Krieckhaus, Jennifer Monson, and\nmany many others) I saw the play between\ntheir knowing selves and then-\nmore vulnerable under-selves. Both\nskill and vulnerability were highlighted\nor confusing situations they placed\nthemselves in when performing.\nSo, in the formulation of the festival,\nit has become a crucial consideration\nthat both of these aspects of improvisation\nbe exposed and respected.\nIt seemed important to bring to the\nfestival veteran improvisers, people for\nwhom this is their life’s work, who\nalready know their form and have a\ndeep sense of how to play their chosen\nand well-rehearsed “instrument,” as\nDanny puts it. However, it also seemed,\nand still seems, valuable to show work\nthat is a result of tossing together elements,\nassembling people who have not\nworked together before, or who have,\nbut in very different contexts, or whose\nworking process is relatively new and\nunder investigation. I have found myself\nhoping that the audiences of the\nfestival would relish both the exquisite\nskill and control that some performances\nreveal, and also delight in the perhaps\nawkward but no less powerful emergence\nthat occurs when a situation is\nless rehearsed, less formed.\nThe “searching” or “thinking on\nstage” that is sometimes apparent, and\nthe “mistakes” which lend themselves to\na different kind of sense, are potent for\ntheir ability to remind us who we are, to\nremind us of our own essential transparency.\nThe truth that can sometimes\nshine from even the most inexperienced\nperformer or the least “structured” dance\nis, to me, one of the values of improvi-\nsational performance.\nIt seems it may be useful to make\nclear to an audience just what they are\nseeing. If a group or an individual has\nbeen working in a certain form or configuration\nfor a duration of time, it may\nbe important to know that. And if this\nis a first time meeting, or an early-in-\ndevelopment performance, this might\nalso be important to state. This is a\nquestion I am not resolved about. Certainly\nthe festival offers room for questions\nand discussions amongst performers\nand audience, but it’s possible that\nframing performances in an informative\nway might make viewing an “easier”\nand less confusing experience.\nCuration\nOur basis of curation falls roughly\ninto four categories: 1) artists (both\nveterans and emerging) who have a\ncommitment to performing improvisation,\n2) artists who excite us by their\nwork, 3) out-of-town artists, and 4)\ndiversity in terms of race, gender, and\nartistic discipline.\nWe are not attempting to bring to\nthe festival “every” improvisation concept\nwhich is in the works today, this\nbeing an obviously impossible mission\nand one which would demand extensive\nresearch as well as a quite dramatic\npresumption. But neither are we interested\nin narrowing the festival to\nthemes. The ranginess and unwieldiness\nof the festival is in fact one of our\ngoals. There is, however, some focus\non “quality,” and this is of course\nwhere the job of curator gets somewhat\nugly and messy.\nTaking on leadership of something\nnew and of (relatively speaking) large\nscope, does seem to give us, as the\ninitiators, some freedom (or freedom’s\npartner, responsibility) to make decisions\nbased on our own judgment. We\ncould, and this has been suggested,\nrelease the curatorial role altogether and\nallow the event to shape itself on a\nfirst-come-first-served basis or some\nother non-judgmental decision process.\nThe Field operates in this way, as have\nother performance events I have been\npart of. This has not been our choice,\nlargely because of our desire to create\nsomething that reflects our concerns and\ninterests as dancers and dance-makers.\nAlso, we believe that if improvisa-\ntional dance and performance is to be\ntaken seriously as an art form, it is\nuseful to invent forums for the work\nwhich attempt to draw attention from\noutside the community. There is ample\nneed for events which act mostly as\ncommunity supports, and I am extremely\ngrateful for the jams and workshops\nwhich nurture the improvisation community.\nThe festival, on the other hand,\nwhile wishing to support improvisation,\nand to further a sense of community\namongst artists, also hopes to reach\nbeyond the community in order to draw\nnew excitement to the work.\nWe do not curate so tightly that\nthere is no room for recommendations,\nor for people to call us with a particular\nidea. Our curatorial approach has been\nvaried. Some people we have invited to\nbring specific work, others we have\nsimply invited to do something—anything—and\nin other instances, people\napproached us with a desire to perform\nand we made space for them. That, in\na few paragraphs, is pretty much the\nmessy job of it.\nFor next year’s festival, we’re\nmaking a public invitation for proposals\nin order to widen the scope of our curation.\nSee details below.\nI would like to thank Movement\nResearch for their continued support of\nthis project and all the participants\nincluding students, audience members,\nvolunteers, teachers and performers, for\nmaking the festival. We hope in future\nyears to grow in ways that will both\nsurprise and delight us.",

    "Content": "I have recently moved to America\nfrom England. My official papers\ntell me I am a resident alien. I am not\nalienated by this though, I am excited\nstrange place and moving within a new\ntribe open up for me. (Was it George\nBernard Shaw who said that the Americans\nand the English are divided by a\ncommon language?)\nI remember the other big move I\nmade in 1961 when I left the genteel\nHome Counties of England for the Anatolian\nsteppes of Turkey in Asia. I was\nnever quite the same again. That move\nwas not only geographical but also\ncultural and intellectual. The move led\nto a series of shifting perceptions and\nfundamentally changed understandings—a\nrealisation that my own culture\nhad taught me its own definition of the\nworld as if it was writ in stone, when in\nfact it was only a relative view. I began\nto see that even the most subtle and\nflexible of my native institutions (my\nmother tongue and my body language),\nplaced very particular and fundamental\nparameters and limitations on my understanding\nof everything and my communication\nwith everyone. English ways\nof perceiving and communicating were\nnow simply part of a series of possibilities.\nMy sojourn in Turkey meant that\nthe realm of the “possible” was forever\nenlarged. What will America hold in\nstore? It already looks promising.\nOver the years as I moved my\nthoughts and practice around (eventually\nback to England), my professional base\nshifted from theatre and visual art, to\neducation, to psychology, to psychoanalysis,\nto body-based therapies, back to\ntheatre and now dance, to contact improvisation.\nWhy change fields so often? Since\nan early teaching experience with an\neleven-year-old girl who improvised\naround the story of Macbeth and revealed\nto herself and the rest of us a\nprivate world of family abuse, I have\nbeen in search of a Holy Grail. A\nsystem of thought and practice which is\nnot trapped in a mind/body split and\nwhich recognises the healing potential\nof the performance metaphor on an\nindividual and communal level.\nAs I am the person that made this\nparticular interprofessional journey I\nhave some understanding of the links\nbetween one field of practice and another.\nIn England, professionally articulating\nthe links and connections between\neach field, and/or integrating one field\nwithin another has always proved difficult.\nEach field proves to have its own\nlanguage, its own professional identity,\nits own self-imposed legitimate and\nprivileged area of enquiry, a keen sense\nof its own “professionalism.” The\nprivileged area of enquiry in each discipline\nseems to manifest as an implicit/\nunconscious and explicit/public\ncode—an almost tribal list of do’s and\ndon’ts, yielding to its aficionados, its\nown flashes of insight, and its own\nblind spots.\nPsychoanalysis, for example, places\nprimary importance on Mind. The\nBody tends to be seen as an instinctual\nboiler-room finding release through a\nseries of developmentally linked orifices—oral,\nanal, genital. In consulting\nroom practice, psychoanalysis holds the\nbody recumbent and still whilst the\nintricacies of the labyrinthine mind and\npersonal developmental history are\ntracked in detail. Beware those who\ndare to seriously challenge the supremacy\nof Mind over Body from within the\npsychoanalytic tribe. Such a challenge\nis radical, a deconstruction of a previously\nunquestioned assumption. No\ntribe can tolerate a consistent radical\nchallenge to its conceptual underpinning,\nits tribal philosophy and customs.\nThe price is scapegoating at best, expulsion\nfrom the tribe at worst. Wilhelm\nReich researched and published on the\nMind-Body as one system—he was\nrewarded for his efforts by formal expulsion\nfrom the Psychoanalytic Association\nand a public burning of his books\nStates!! (This century, folks! Really!)\nMy own attempts to have my group\ntherapy clients sitting on the floor rather\nthan on chairs so that the body is free\nto move and be fully involved was\nregarded within the Tavistock Clinic in\nLondon in 1976 as peculiar, even dangerous.\nPermission to proceed was\nreluctantly granted after bruising battles\nin committee rooms, with the proviso\nthat my group would be observed continuously\nfrom behind a one way mirror\ngraduation from the psychotherapy\ntraining course might now be in\nquestion.\nSuspicion abounds on both sides of\nthe professional spectrum. Even now,\ntwenty-five years later, I am still\namazed that many English performers\nand arts academics are deeply reluctant\nto articulate the connection between\nperformance making/training and a\nhealing process. Indeed many performing\nartists (in England) tend to eschew\nthe therapies (despite the emergence of\nthe drama and dance therapies); seeing\nthe psychotherapies in particular as\npotentially creativity-sucking, draining\nthe artist of the unnamable force which\nfuels the artistic drive.\nWhen I finally made contact with\ncontacters (most of whom come from\nthe American tribe), I began to meet\npeople who live in both worlds...weaving\ntheir way through life as both performers\nand bodyworkers, working daily\nwith the unity of the body-mind system\nand with a consciousness of healing\nforces. There was still a gap however;\neach of the people I talked to have\ntrained as dancer/performer separately\nfrom training as a bodyworker. The\nessential synthesis between one field\nand another had been left to them to\ndiscover or not. The Holy Grail was\nstill elusive.\nArriving in the Bay Area this autumn,\nnot consciously thinking of the\nHoly Grail, I rang Carol Swann to get\ndirections to the Berkeley Contact Jam.\nShe was glad to hear from me; she is\nputting together a new school and invited\nme to come to a board meeting.\n“The School has the body as its\nfocus and a field of study that moves\nthrough education, health, movement\nresearch and performance,” said Carol,\nand my ears immediately pricked up.\nUnder one roof, speaking one language,\ninterconnecting, cross-fertilising? Is it\npossible? After all these years?\nI was tremendously heartened by the\nboard meeting—a cross section of artists,\nbodyworkers, teachers, community\nleaders and business advisors—the\ngroup had its right and left hemispheres\nboth in gear simultaneously. The room\nsparkled with vision, efficiency, humour,\ngood communication, experience, committment\nand a sense of genuine preparedness\nfor an educational adventure.\nSome of the words used give an idea of\nthe underlying vision of SPAR—School\nfor Participatory Arts and Research—\n“creative and sustaining careers in the\narts, health and education,” “contemporary\nexperiments and traditional forms\nin the performing arts and somatic research,”\n“guided by our students’ interests,”\n“hands-on education,” “activating\ncreativity and health in the individual\nand the community,” “cultivating the\nwisdom of the body towards mutual\ngrowth and social change.”\nBut more consoling than all the\nmind/body/healing/art words (many are\nthe unfulfilled educational promises I\nhave heard spoken over the years), more\nimpressive than the detailed business\nplan and the galvanising inspiration of\nthe Mission Statement, was the physical\n\nbehaviour of the board: without shedding\none iota of their intelligent approach\nto the task in hand, my fellow\nboard members stretched, breathed and\nmoved around whenever they felt like it.\nDiscussion did not falter; attention did\nnot flag. Actions speak louder than\nwords. If a board of directors has the\ninstitutional freedom to be thinking,\nmoving bodies at one and the same\ntime, the fruit of the school will undoubtedly\nbe a feast of synthesis, integration\nand new connections.\nCarol is the Executive Director and\nis to be applauded for her vision and\nunruffled sense of good humoured purpose.\nHer experience with contact,\nvoice, bodywork and Hakomi therapy\nideally prepares her to facilitate those\nwho work with her in making new links\nbetween mind and body, healing and\nperformance. She also has a remarkable\nhistory of successful innovation\n(Administrative Director of Movement\nResearch, co-founder of A Cappella\nMotion, Island Movement, New Forms\nand the Outfall Dance Intensive.) She\nhas gathered together a multi-talented\nfounding group of directors. Martha\nEddy (the founder of Somatic Movement\nTherapy, a blend of Body-Mind\nCentering1”1 and Laban Movement Analysis)\nwill develop the somatics aspect of\nthe curriculum. Dancer/choreographer\nJon Weaver will develop the performance\naspect of the School’s work.\nMark Griffith is the administrative\ndirector. Mark is an artist and dancer\nwho has specialised in arts administration.\nHe brings to the school a very\nclear sense of forward-looking creative\nplanning, of articulating philosophy and\nof developing goals and budget sheets\nwhich reflect the vision and values of\nthe founding group.\nCore faculty includes Sara Shelton\nMann (First Moves), Kirstie Simson\n(Gutsy dancing, Contact Improv), Jon\nWeaver (Contemporary technique), Lisa\nSchmidt (Contemporary technique\ntaught through the lens of Body-Mind\nCentering1\"1 and Authentic Movement),\nCarol Swann (Vocal Motion), Lauren\nElder (Site Specific Interdisciplinary\nWork), Martha Eddy (Somatic Movement\nTherapy, Movement Analysis and\nObservation, Hands-on Repatteming).\nVisiting teachers will offer courses in\nchoreography, improvisation, Felden-\nkrais method, voice, Hakomi, Aikido,\nand more.\nWith contact improvisation as a core\ndiscipline, the usual roles of student/\nteacher, therapist/client are expected to\ngradually shift towards a more creative\ninterchange.\nMembers of the school, whether\ntheir research is weighted in favour of\nsomatic studies or performance studies\nwill have the opportunity to work with\nand for the wider community during the\nsecond term—therefore study will range\nfrom the micro-cellular to working in\ncommunity contexts.\nThe school aims to offer a certification\nprogram for teachers, performing\nartists and movement therapists who\nwant to bridge the fields of education,\nhealth and the arts. The vision is that\ngraduates will be able to register as\nmovement therapists and at the same\ntime develop into community leaders\nand social change artists who integrate\ntheir ideas and practice into the world.\nOutreach programs to expand participation\nin the arts for underserved and\nspecial populations and to support community\nexpressions of culture are part\nof the program.\nThe course lasts a year (full time)\nbut can (oh joy, oh joy) be undertaken\nin modular form for those who can’t\nafford the time (September to May), or\nthe money, to pursue it on a full time\nbasis. Despite my thirty-year preoccupation\nwith split mind/body and\nhealth/arts systems, I am so aware of\ngaps in my understanding. This program\ncould enable me to investigate\nthem.\nI am excited by this. The last time\nI had this feeling of wanting to be a\nstudent on a course that I was involved\nin developing was in the Theatre Department\nof Dartington College of Arts,\nwhich I joined after my period with\npsychoanalysis. There, the visionary\neducator Colette King brought together\na faculty which included actors, writers,\ndirectors, dancers, choreographers, psychologists,\nsociologists and community\nanimateurs. It was there that I met\nMary Fulkerson, Steve Paxton, Lisa\nNelson, Simone Forti and many others\nand saw for the first time dances that\nwere kinetically (and therefore internally)\ndriven—a revelation and source of\nmind/body fascination for me for the\nyears that followed. It was one of the\nmost fruitful turning points of my life.\nThe Touchdown Dance project which I\nlater set up with Steve in England continues\nto provide a movement research\nforum and performance training for\nmixed groups of blind and sighted people.\nThat experience was like travelling\nto a foreign country. Scales fell from\nmy eyes, weight dropped from my\nrediscovered body, space opened up in\nmy imagination, new dynamics emerged\nin my communication with myself and\nothers.\nSPAR seems to be another turning\npoint; another benefit of leaving the Old\nWorld of preconceptions and arriving in\nthe New World of changing perceptions.\nI am glad to be a resident alien, or—to\nborrow the language of the tribe in this\nland—I am glad to join this project with\npioneers on a new (or is it a very old)\nfrontier.",

    "Abstract": "This article is a journal entry detailing Paul Langland's experience teaching and performing at a dance festival in Havana, Cuba in 1994. It highlights the cultural exchange, artistic collaboration, and the challenges faced by the Cuban artistic community due to political and economic constraints. The author reflects on the stark differences between life in Cuba and the United States, and the resilience and passion of the Cuban dancers.",
    "Content": "In April 1994, the second Taller\nInternacional de Danza Experimental\nwas held in Havana, Cuba. The\nfestival was organized by David Zambrano,\nVenezuelan dancer from New\nYork, and Rosario Cardenas, director\nof the Cuban dance company Danza\nCombinatorio. Along with Alexis\nEupierre from Barcelona and Becky\nHilton from NY, I was invited to teach\nand perform for two weeks at the\nTeatro Nacional.\nWhat follows is an abridged version\nof my journal. Each day was\nfilled with confrontations, magic, and\nsurprises which are hard to convey.\nIn concern for the political safety of\nmany of the new friends / made there,\nI’ve omitted details of experiences and\nconversations that I feel might endanger\nthem. But I would like to say that\nthe artistic community I came in contact\nwith is complex and cosmopolitan\nand the issues are not always black\nand white. Each day was an eye\nopener. Being in a country so cut off\nfrom the U.S., and thus so different\nfrom my world, made each day feel as\nif reality was being reconstructed.\n4/3/94 Big changes in plans to go to\nCuba. With visa and schedule problems,\nwe all missed our original departure\ndates. David thinks that there is a\n70% chance of the tour happening. If\nvisas arrive today, we can leave for\nMiami on Tuesday, and go to Havana\non Wednesday. Three days late, but\nbetter late than never.\nPaul in Old Havana.\n4/6/94 Flood of activity at Miami\nAirport. Flight to Havana postponed—no,\nnow it’s on time. During\nfinal boarding, Becky Hilton is informed\nthat she is not allowed to go,\nno one is sure why, but that I can.\nFor some reason there’s not enough\nproof that there’s a visa waiting for\nher in Cuba. We make two desperate\ncalls to New York. “Bye honey, you\nare brave,” says Colin’s sleepy voice.\n“Well, go for the experience,” urges\nDavid. Later, alone, I arrive at Jose\nMarti Airport. The airport is having\nmultiple power blackouts, alarms\nringing each time.\nIn the evening, there are constant\ndiscussions with my new hosts, vaguely\nunderstood, about what happened to\nBecky, and what is happening with\nAlexis. It is extremely difficult to call\nor fax Cuba, so little was known about\narrangements from our end.\nWhat a beautiful, yet crumbling\ncity. No one speaks English. I am\nsoon engaged in intense negotiations\nover the hotel room price. Finally it\nis lowered by half—thank god because\nI have limited cash, and absolutely no\nway of getting more before returning.\n4/7/94 The class went very well. The\nstudents are at many different levels.\nMany are beautiful movers. They\nhave tremendous passion and clarity in\ntheir bodies, while easily integrating\nreleased warmups, and improvisational\ncomposition information. There are\n35 people in class from many different\nmodem dance companies and schools.\nRosario Cardenas, the festival producer\nin Havana, is introducing me to\nmany people in the dance world\nhere—choreographers, musicians,\ndancers, scene designers. Along with\nall of the other difficulties of life in\nCuba, she is constantly teaching off\nroles to new company members. Each\ntime she takes her company out of\nCuba on tour, several defect Sadly,\nshe says that she can’t blame them.\nHer salary equals $4 per month. Her\ndancers earn $1.78 per month.\n4/8/94 Rosario’s birthday party.\nGreat! Rosario’s composer was there\nwho is the son of Virgilio Pinera. I\nhave just read about Virgilio in Rein-\naldo Arenas’s rich and tortuous Cuban\nbiography Before Night Falls. Also\nthere was Jean McLean, an Australian\nmember of parliament on a diplomatic\ntrip to Cuba to explore ways to increase\ntourism to Cuba.\nCompany members of Rosario’s\ngave me salsa lessons—so sensual yet\ndignified. I improved with rum and\nthe raucous encouragement of all\nthere. Then on to Afro-Cuban dance.\nI didn’t know my hips were so bad. I\nguess I shouldn’t be surprised considering\nmy Northern European genetic\nimpediment. I brought a bag of chocolates\n(from the States) to the party.\nThey created a sensation. There is\nlitte food or anything else to be found;\nno meat, fruit, vegetables, candy,\npaint, hardware, plastic, or clothing.\nOutside Rosario’s house, the street\nwas pitch black. Most houses are also\nwithout electricity. As the power\nplants break down, electricity is turned\noff for 8 to 10 hours a day. It is 1994\nin the center of a city of 2 million.\nThere is no light. Candles are an\nexpensive luxury.\n4/9/94 Classes are going well. The\nstudents are smart and passionate.\nRosa Elena, Rosario’s manager, took\nme to the tourist food store. I bought\nher family a big can of powdered milk\nwhich they can’t afford. Her father is\na doctor and her mother is a lawyer.\nShe was trembling at the sight of such\nluxuries as cooking oil and bread. I\nwas fighting tears. Later I attempt to\ngo to a performance of Isabel Bustos’s\ncompany. We all sit in the dark courtyard\nof a Spanish colonial mansion,\nnow a theater, hoping that power will\ncome on to run the show. After two\nhours we all leave, no power, no\nshow.\nAlexis arrived, a minor miracle.\nHis flight from Spain had a sudden\nunannounced schedule change. I realize\nnow that Becky is not going to\nmake it. We cannot call or fax the\nStates to get any information. Like\nBecky, Alexis’s visa was invalid, but\nhe was able to buy a tourist visa on\nthe spot for $30 at Madrid airport.\nFrom the U.S.A. this is impossible.\nBecause of the embargo against Cuba,\nany financial transaction with Cuba,\nincluding the purchase of a tourist\nvisa, is strictly forbidden.\n4/11/94 More performances—these\nperformed during the daylight so they\nweren’t cancelled. The work of Mari-\nanela Bonn’s company, Danza Abierta,\nis beautiful, with passion and content\nin the form of magic realism, yet\nconfluent with the released and impro-\nvisational quality of work from downtown\nNY. Also a trip to a great\nbeach, and being a guest at a honest-\nto-goodness Havana gay party. Being\ngay myself, this was one of many\nenlightening experiences—so similar to\nthe U.S. in style and values, yet so\ndifferent in terms of political acceptance.\nIt’s amazing to see how far\nunderground gay life can be driven\nand still survive and even thrive.\nBack at the hotel, I met a doctor\nwho will look for aspirin at the hospital\nfor my knee which has been acting\nup.\n4/12/94 The doctor, Omar, returned\nto the hotel with word that there is no\naspirin at the hospital. He offered a\nSantoria healing for me, since his\nstepsister is a priestess. I accept.\nLater, Alexis and I are guests of\nAlberto Mendes, the choreographer of\nthe National Ballet of Cuba, for a\nrehearsal of the company in their\nbeautiful, crumbling Spanish colonial\nstudios.\n4/13/94 Classes are very deep and\nsatisfying. Alex and I work well\ntogether. There is no water at the\nstudio. The elevator to the eighth\nfloor, where we teach, broke several\nyears ago, and there are no parts to fix\nit. There is no soap to wash the floor.\nStudents bicycle up to eight miles to\nget to class. They, along with their\ndirectors, have little to eat or drink.\nAfter rich, energetic classes, we\nare all covered with dust and dirt, and\nare dehydrated by the 95 degree humid\nheat. All of this at the large\nmodem Teatro Nacional, the Lincoln\nCenter of Cuba. It’s quickly turning\ninto a technological ruin as the country\ngrinds to a halt.\nIn the early evening, I have my\nSantoria healing. Sitting on a chair\nover a chalk circle full of symbols, the\nair is purified by burning pools of\nkerosene splashed on the tile floor.\nOmar’s sister goes into her trance;\nsmoking a cigar, barking, moaning,\nand writhing, she is lovingly and\ncarefully guided by her sister as they\ngradually approach me from the altar.\n4/14/94 Alberto Mendes takes Alexis\nand me to the Morrow, the huge ancient\nfortress used until recently as a\nprison for political prisoners, criminals\nand gays. I have just read the chapter\nin Arenas’s book about his imprisonment\nthere in the 1970s for being an\nartist and a homosexual. Next we\nwent to the Cuban Arts Club in a\nstylish old mansion of which there are\nthousands in Havana.\nAt our last class, we handed out\npackages of toothpaste and shampoo\nwhich we had brought with us for the\nstudents. I perform my solo. My\ndancing is intense. I think I’ve been\naffected by their struggle, salsa, Santoria,\nand their passion for dance. I\nshow videotapes brought from New\nYork. I feel sad to leave these new\nfriends and talented dancers. Alexis is\nscheduled to perform on the weekend,\nsince his flight leaves two days later.\nAfterwards, at Rosario’s house,\nshe shows us videos of her work.\nThere is an exciting, fertile, developed\ndance scene here, partly because dance\nis such a part of the culture, and also\nperhaps because they must fight for\ntheir dancing.\n4/15/94 At the airport, I’m filled with\nemotion about my time spent here. I\nhave never been so affected by a place\nand its people so quickly and deeply.\nI’ll never forget this intense, exotic,\nand artistically rich two weeks. A\nfriend in Havana asked me if I was\nthere to study or teach. I really started\nto feel that I was there to do both.\nHeartfelt thanks to David Zambrano,\nRosario Cardenas and her company,\nthe Taller Intemacional de\nDanza Experimental, the Suitcase\nFund of Dance Theater Workshop, and\nthe Department of Undergraduate\nDrama at New York University for\nhelping to make this amazing cultural\nexchange possible. ★",

Kevin Kortan offers a brief, poetic contemplation on the act of standing still throughout the performance, highlighting the internal experience of stillness.",
    "Content": "two views of performing Trisha Brown's For M.G.: The Movie\nLast Summer while planning a lecture-demonstration for the Colorado Dance Festival,\nTrisha invited me to speak about my experience of the running solo in For M.G.: The Movie. I\nchose to write something rather than speak impromptu. In preparation for this article in CQ,\nKevin Kortan, another dancer in the piece, was inspired to write about his singular role of\nstanding for the duration of the dance. Kevin and I have often congratulated, joked and\ncommiserated on the internal similarities of our roles.\nAbout the dance: In 1991 Trisha Brown made a thirty-three minute dance, For M.G.: The\nMovie, with music by Alvin Curran and lighting design by Spencer Brown. There are four main\ncomponents to the dance: a man standing stage left facing upstage for the duration of the piece, a\nwoman running, a highly technical unison duet between a man and a woman based on the idea\nof a cube rotating through the space, and an eccentric gestural solo for a woman. Even though\nthere are moments when these components occupy the space at the same time, they are performed\nindependent of each other. There is also a trio of two men and a woman that laces through the\nduet. It is a partnering trio re-organizing the duet phrase, in which one of the men is out of sync,\nacting as a voyeur. Slow motion is one of the devices used in the dance to create an elastic, filmic\napproach to time. [D.M.]\n\nThe running solo feels like I’m a marble released in a bowl\nfollowing its course without interruption.\nThere are stops, but they are like the peak of a swing\nwhen no movement is visible as the transition\nis made through the balance of up and down.\nThe time and shape of the dance is determined by\nthe proportions of the space I’m filling\nand the balancing of forward and backward movement\nwith gravity, momentum and centrifugal force.\nIts simplicity strips bare the essential relationship between\ndancer and form.\nThe dance becomes the moment to moment assessment\nof that relationship.\nIn its idealized version the assessment is accurate,\nforces are aligned and I’m dancing at the\nedge of my capabilities.\nThe actual dance is in the miscalculations...\novershoot the edge and I may hit the deck,\nundershoot and I use my muscles too much.\nOne of the inspirations for this dance came from\nrunning down mini-mountains in Montana in one pass\none fell swoop\none non-stop action beginning at the top and\nending at the bottom.\nIt was like skiing without skis\nusing the momentum of the fall to connect the action\nfrom start to finish, making it one huge gesture.\nto the running solo, I see the dance as a song.\nThe repetitions of the forms are the vibrations\nwhich make up the elongated tones of a song.\nThe dance was made in a 40’ by 28’ space.\nI wear that space. It’s a tight fit.\nIf I lose a couple feet in either direction\nit changes the sound of the dance\nsmaller forms\nmore repetitions\nfaster vibrations\nhigher tone.\nMaking this dance, through Trisha’s direction, we mined\na form that is essential to who I am.\nBecause of its fierce simplicity it is one of the\nmost challenging dances I’ve ever performed.\n\n- Diane Madden\n\nMaking the running solo, Trisha and I often relied on drawing to communicate our ideas.\nWe were both surprised by my sure hand and Trisha encouraged me to draw more with a\ngift of 30” x 20” drawing paper and black crayons. The drawings became another creative\nprocess for me with their own logic. What worked three-dimensionally did not always\nwork on paper. One exception was the figure-eight form which is the first of the ten forms\nin the dance. In the drawings, any more than two, or sometimes three, forms would\nclutter the page, and I made up forms which don’t appear in the dance. Each drawing\nhad its own particular rhythmic song as it was being made. They are similar to the dance\nin their ongoingness.\nThe drawing is finished when my hand stops moving.\n\n\nA CALL TO DANCE\nStand.\nOkay, standing.\nAlways beginning, always ending\nMoving\nStilling\nMy task: to stand — still — in place — feet under hips — arms at my sides.\nFor how long? At the inception of this dance, who knew? It was the first full\npiece that I had made with Trisha. All I knew was — I wanted to DANCE!\nMeanwhile as we made the dance, I stood and waited and stood and wondered\nand stood and angered and stood and laughed and stood and cried and stood\nand stiffened and stood and relaxed and stood and breathed and stood and\ndirected my body and stood and listened to my body, my heart, my spirit and\nstood and waited and stood. Ultimately the question arose, “Why should I begin\nto move when the dance seems to be forming in relation to my stillness?”\nStillness is to movement what silence is to sound: the point of departure and\nthe point to which all returns.\n\nIt was becoming more and more apparent that I had found my place in this\ndance, whether I liked it or not.\nI am past\nI am present\nI am future\nI am someone\nI am no one\nI am everyone\nI am\nEveryman\nshould have the opportunity to stand and have his silent stillness be witnessed\nHow is it that this standing is at times a refuge, a safe haven, even blissful,\nwhile at other times it is claustrophic, a trap, torturous? I began to realize that\nthis forced meditation could be mine if I accepted it — all 33 minutes of it.\nAccept it and all that runs through me: the waves of energy and thought\ndispersing, collecting\ndraining me, filling me\nDoes the back of my body reveal my history? Can my experience of the moment\nbe felt as I face away?\nI am a Mountain formed through time, not the same as before — changed,\nchanging. Change marks itself slowly, with clear paint, barely noticeable on the\nsurface, but still there; until an avalanche comes and all tumbles. Twice, just\n1 minute short of the 33, I fainted.\nDying Living\nI listen to all in and around myself through the breath,\nmy breath moving, stilling\nStill moving\nMoving stillness\nStill\nStanding...\n\n- Kevin Kortan",

    "Content": "International Festival of Movement & Dance on the Volga\nLate summer felt like winter\nwhen the American and European\ndancers arrived at the Druzhba, a\nformer Soviet Communist Party hotel\nin Yaroslavl, Russia. They entered the\nstark and chilly lobby after midnight in\na time zone halfway around the world.\nA translator loudly attempted to direct\nthe exhausted travelers. At the desk,\ndisinterested local hotel employees\nwere handing out room keys only in\nanswer to requests made in Russian. I\nsuddenly realized that I knew everyone\nwell by their credentials but found\nmyself surprisingly hard pressed to put\nnames to unfamiliar faces...\nThis was the scene of the arrival of\nthe twenty-five-member Western\ncontingent of participants for the First\nInternational Festival on the Volga, The\nArt of Movement 1993. They had met\nin Moscow Airport for the five-hour\nbus ride north to Yaroslavl. Participants'\npoints of origin included Canada,\nthe United States, Puerto Rico, and\nvarious cities in northern Europe. Some\nhad traveled as many as thirty-six\nhours to reach Moscow.\nThe festival took place from August\n27 to September 6, 1993. Its purpose\nwas to bring together a wide range of\nRussian and Western movement and\ndance artists and professionals. As\nfestival organizer and Western director,\nit was my hope that such a festival\ncould encourage artistic and personal\nunderstanding through collaboration\nand shared experience in the fields of\ndance and movement.\ntogether a representative group of\nWestern and Russian dancers to exchange\ninformation and ideas. This\nexchange aspect of the festival was\nvery important to me. Also, my intention\nin organizing the Western contingent\nwas both to bring skilled Western\nartists to Russia and to assemble a\ngroup that could represent the diversity\nof dance and movement interests in\nthe West.\nBackground\nThe Russian participants included\ndancers, movement artists, theatrical\ndirectors, and dance and theatre students,\nmany of whom came from Moscow,\nas well as from former Soviet\nrepublics far from Russia.\nThe North American and European\ncontingent consisted of movement\neducators and performers, modem\ndancers and choreographers, including\nDuncan performers. Classes and workshops\nincluded choreography, technique,\nimprovisation, movement\nawareness techniques, dance for the\nvideo camera and a dance/ video work\npresentation.\nMy primary desire was to bring\nOrganization and\nImplementation\nIn Russia, everyone wanted to\nknow why I chose Yaroslavl for the\nlocation of the festival. An ancient\nRussian city, Yaroslavl dates back to\n1010. It was once the capital of Russia,\nalthough only for about a year, and is\nlocated on the Volga River. Well-\nknown for its beautiful architecture\nand design, it is among the historic\ncircle of Russian cities surrounding\nMoscow known as the \"Golden Ring.\"\nYaroslavl was a safer environment than\nMoscow due to the current unstable\npost-Soviet economic and political\nsituation. Statistically, Moscow is now\nranked among the most dangerous\ncities in the world, primarily due to the\nmarked increase of organized crime.\nIt was possible to organize and implement\na festival in Russia once I had,\nover a five-year period, established a\nbase of experience and contacts within\nthe country. I had spent several previous\nsummers in Yaroslavl and had\nmany friends and contacts whom I\nknew I could rely upon for help and\nsupport The support and interest of\nmany people in the West also served to\nbuoy my efforts. The strong and inspiring\nresponse to an article that I\nwrote for Contact Quarterly, \"A\nGlimpse of a Movement: Improvising\nin Russia\" (Spring/Summer '91, VoL\n16, no. 2), was my initial incentive.\nPeople wrote and telephoned me from\nall over the world to express their\ninterest in going to Russia. I was surprised\nand touched by these responses,\nand it meant a lot to me that several\npeople who wrote to me after my original\narticle attended the festival in Russia\nseveral years later.\nA trip to Yaroslavl in January of\n1993 while in Russia for an International\nIsadora Duncan Retrospective led to\nthe break I had been seeking for several\nyears. Concern \"IKAR\", a Russian\nbusiness organization formed since\nGlasnost, saw in the festival an opportunity\nfor publicity and profit from\nWesterners, as well as to enhance the\nartistic reputation of the city of Yaroslavl.\nA steering committee was\nformed consisting of Russian director\nOlga Sedmova (vice-president of Concern\n\"IKAR\"); myself, as international\ndirector; and representatives of the\nUnion of Theatrical Workers and\nTheatrical Institute of YaroslavL\nThe Great Net was the theater\ngroup with whom the idea for the\nfestival had first been created. However,\nfor purposes of good communication,\nI found that I had to work with a\nwell-established organization, such as\nConcern \"IKAR.\"\nIn March of 1993,1 founded a small\norganization called Link Vostok (a\nblend of English and Russian that\nmeans 'link with the East\") to facilitate\nthe festival and future East/West\ndance and movement exchanges. I had\nsome assistance with grant writing\nfrom the Massachusetts-based Network\nfor International Exchange, but was not\nable to attract funds. This meant that I\ncould not hire people to assist in the\norganization of the festival. Instead, I\nserved as the sole Western organizer,\noften bartering Alexander Technique\nlessons for help in preparing massive\nmailings.\nOnce the framework for the festival\nwas in place, my real work began. It\nwas early February and the festival was\nscheduled to begin in August. All of\nthe specifics of participant registration\nand commitments of space, housing,\nand translators had to be completed\nwith immediacy. I prepared a brochure\nand did an eight-hundred-piece\nmailing calling for proposals for lectures,\nclasses, workshops and performances.\nFortunately, Concern \"IKAR\" had a\nfax machine, not common in Russia at\nthe time; without communication by\nfax, none of the initial arrangements\ncould have been made. Phone connection\nwas exorbitantly expensive and of\npoor quality. Correspondence by mail\nwas impossibly slow and unreliable.\nThe everchanging economic and political\nconditions in Russia added an element\nof challenge and uncertainty.\nAnother important aspect of festival\nimplementation was the planning of\nnightly concerts by Eastern and Western\nartists. The process of organizing,\nscheduling, and contracting performers\nwas complicated by language, cultural,\nand geographic differences.\nThe First Day\nThe opening day of the festival was\na Sunday. No classes were planned for\nthis day in order to give travelers an\nopportunity to adjust to the new time\nzone and to recover from their journeys.\nA trip to the historic Tolga Nunnery\ntook place Sunday morning. The\nnuns at Tolga live exactly like nuns did\nin the Middle Ages. Pre-Glasnost, the\nnunnery was a hidden Soviet prison on\nthe Volga. No one in Yaroslavl even\nknew of the prison's existence. Prior to\nthe prison, there was a monastery at\nthat location. The trip to the nunnery\nwas followed by an afternoon tour of\nsome of the theatres and spaces we\nwould use, followed by a meeting for\nthe foreign participants with myself\nand Olga, the Russian director.\nSunday evening there was a performance\nin the Theatre for Young Spectators,\nan ornate 1,500-seat modem theatre\nbuilt during the Soviet era. Many\ndance groups from the Yaroslavl region\nperformed that evening, primarily\nthe more traditional Russian dance\nforms—folk dance and ballet There\nwas a large number of dancers of all\nages, many were very young and all\nwere highly skilled.\nPatricia Adams, artistic co-director\nof the American dance company, Dances\nInternational Isadora Duncan Retrospective\nin January 1993 in Moscow,\naptly commented that \"in Russia,\nmany more children are involved in\nthe study of music and dance than in\nthe U.S.\" Isadora Duncan had lived in\nMoscow right after the Russian revolution\nand was married to the poet Sergei\nEsenin. Russians remain very interested\nin her, and I have met Russian\nwomen who danced with her as children.\nThe first day ended with a two-\nhour boat ride on the Volga River for\nall participants. This allowed Eastern\nand Western artists to meet socially for\nthe first time. The air was cool. Even\nthough it was still August, many trees\nhad already turned color. There was a\nbeautiful lingering sunset, and birch\ntrees lined the riverbank, interspersed\nwith old, often abandoned, onion-\ndomed fifteenth and sixteenth-century\nchurches. Yaroslavl used to have more\nthan a hundred such churches. About\ntwenty remain today, the rest were\ndestroyed during fighting between the\nRed and White Armies and by Stalin's\nattempts at modernization and the\ndestruction of religion.\n\nChallenges\n\nOne of the difficulties of international\ncoordination was to meet the\nexpectations and demands of the Russian\norganizers, who maintained very\ninflexible deadlines about applications,\ndeposits, and housing.\nI went to Russia five weeks before\nthe festival to complete a variety of\npreliminaries such as biographies,\nschedules, and publicity. One important\ndetail, finding an adequate floor\nfor barefoot dancers, was never fully\naccomplished. Russian dancers almost\nalways wear shoes. No one understood\nwhat \"marley\" was. We finally\nhad to settle for a cloth covering on an\nuneven wooden floor at our primary\ntheatre. Detailed bilingual schedules\nwere needed by all participants, translators,\nand staff. Except for Concern\n\"IKAR\", most of the Russian organizers\nwere volunteers with varying degrees\nof reliability.\nI immediately ordered bottles of\nexpensive and hard-to-find mineral\nwater for participants because the tap\nwater isn't safe to drink. Russians\ndon't drink water the way that Americans\ndo. I had to convince organizers\nof its importance. When the water\narrived, it turned out to be heavily\nsalted and there was no time to reorder.\nFood was an issue as well. In\nprevious years, I had encountered\nsevere food shortages. There was\nmuch more food available during the\nsummer of 1993 (although prices were\nvery high in rubles). Even so, the\nrestaurant at the hotel Druzhba provided\nvery poorly turned out meals.\nThere were many complaints about the\nfood. For example, a meal for vegetarians\nwas sometimes just rice! Eventually\nwe paid our bus driver to go to the\nmarket and buy fresh fruit and vegetables\nfor the participants.\nIn the summer in Yaroslavl, major\nrepair work is done on the water systems.\nThis always requires certain\nareas of the city to be without hot\nwater for weeks at a time. Unfortunately,\nthe hotel was without hot water\nfor the entire duration of the festival,\nand the weather was unpredictably\ncold. Most participants had not\nbrought warm enough clothing. This\nremained an unresolvable problem.\nOn the third day of the festival,\nOlga, my Russian counterpart, left for\nBelgium with one of my primary organizers\nand translators, not to return\nbefore the end of the festival. That\nwas a frustrating blow.\nAlso, originally the festival was to\ntake place at the famed Volkov Theatre,\nthe first Russian public theatre.\nHowever, when I told the director of\nthe Volkov that I could not accommodate\ntheir request to organize a corresponding\nfestival in Boston, Massachusetts,\nfor a date just one month after\nthe Russian festival, they pulled out I\ndid not discover this until my arrival\nin Yaroslavl.\nThe Russian organizers had to find\nparticipants for the festival, as well as\naudiences for nightly concerts. Information\nappeared widely in print media,\nand a Russian-language interview\nwith me was broadcast on the radio,\nlocally and nationally. The publicity\nwas very effective. Russians could\ntake classes or attend workshops without\ncharge.\nClasses and Workshops\nI liked the idea of getting people\nfrom different backgrounds together in\nan intensive setting where they must\nwork together, collaborate, or disagree,\nwith movement as their common denominator.\nWe had ten translators\nassigned to the festival and a large\nproportion of them were, though very\nwell-intentioned, completely unable to\ntranslate the difficult subject matter.\nThis was a source of great frustration\nfor lecturers and meant that the more\nexperienced translators had to work\novertime for very little pay.\nClasses and workshops took place\nat the Theatrical Institute of Yaroslavl\nand at the Theatre for Young Spectators.\nThese buildings were not more\nthan ten city blocks from the Druzhba\nHotel, but for participants unable to\nread signs or ask directions in Russian,\ngetting to class was a complex process!\nThe buildings were spacious and adequate\nexcept for the lack of heat and\nthe floors that did not accommodate\nbarefoot dancers (nor, as U.S. artist\nMargot Mink Colbert said, \"the future\nof modem dance floorwork in Russia\").\nWhen a much needed tape player\nwas unavailable for one of the classes,\na classical pianist was immediately\nfound. \"It was easier to produce an\naccomplished artist than it was to get a\nmachine,\" recalls Patricia Adams.\nSimilarly, several talented and creative\njazz musicians were found to play for\nperformances and classes. They\nbecame important members of the\nfestival.\nAt the Theatre of Railway Workers\nin Yaroslavl, we were invited to watch\na dance class for Yaroslavna, a traditional\nRussian dance group that I had\nvisited earlier in the year. During the\nSoviet system, this company of young\nwomen specialized in learning traditional\ndance forms from all of the republics\nof the Soviet Union.\nPerformances at the festival were\nheld every night and sometimes in the\nafternoon as well. Enthusiastic audiences\nof a thousand or more repeatedly\nfilled the theatre to capacity. I had\nnever expected such a response. The\naudience expressed their appreciation\nwith intensity and creativity, and some\nran up on stage to hug and kiss the\nperformers and give them flowers,\ndrawings, and small gifts. Evenings\nwere divided between programs by all\nRussian groups and all Western\ngroups. The final evening presented\ncollaborations between the two groups\nthat developed during the festival.\nRussian Participants\nA number of Russian dance and\nmovement companies made especially\nimportant contributions to the festival.\nI had a challenging time finding experimental\nand modem-oriented individuals\nand performers. Members of The\nGreat Net theater company with whom\nthe initial idea for the festival originated\nin 1991 were now somewhat scattered—several\nof them had changed\ncareers and some of the women now\nhave young children. However, Alexander\n(Sascha) Girschom and Oleg\nIgnatevo helped with the organizing of\nthe festival by working for Concern\n\"IKAR\" as volunteers. The Great Net\nalso gave a workshop called The History\nof the Great Net and Sascha\nGirschom taught a workshop called\nThe Spaces of the Body. Jan Raukh\ncame from Moscow to participate.\nThey are grateful for their Contact\nQuarterly subscriptions; one issue arrived\nthe week before the festival.\nEveryone marveled at a letter to the\neditor about the upcoming festival.\nSaira Blanche Theater is a group of\nartists based in Moscow. They contacted\nme at the suggestion of Natanja den\nBoeft in Holland who had written to\nme several years prior, after my first\narticle in CQ. For ten years, members\nof this group have worked with movement,\nmusic, sound, and the voice in\nexperimental theatre. They explore\ndifferent environmental spaces and\nthree years ago started to work with\nNew Dance and Contact Improvisation.\nThey opened the first \"Contact Club\"\nin Moscow. They are currently very\neager to find people who work with\nthe deaf and movement. At the festival,\nthey performed and participated in\nclasses.\nMargot Mink Colbert remarked\nthat 'The Saira Blanche Theater exhibited\nthe kind of commitment, focus,\nand intensity that we experienced in\nNew York in the sixties and seventies.\nAs an avant-garde theater, they are\ninto a total life participation, you\nknow, art as life...rather than being\nprofessionally oriented towards the\nproduction of art They are living life\nas an art.... They have a kind of cooperative\nheadquarters with a studio\nspace...\"\nJeanne Ruddy, a member of the\nfaculty at the Juilliard School in New\nYork City, told me about several interesting\nRussian companies that she had\nmet at an American Dance Festival\nevent in Moscow three years ago. She\nwas a wonderful resource. She recommended\nthe Kontrasty (Contrasts)\nDance Theatre from Petropavlovsk-\nKamchatsky on the eastern side of\nRussia in Kamchatka, near the Aleutian\nIslands.\nThe mayor of the town of Petro-\npavlovsk-Kamchatsky paid for twenty-\nsix young women from Kontrasty\nDance Theatre, choreographer Inna\nKominskaya, and director Elena Kor-\nmochi to make the nine-hour flight to\nMoscow from Kamchatka and the five-\nhour train ride to Yaroslavl Kontrasty\npresented a fascinating evening-length\nperformance of material derived in part\nfrom modem dance techniques studied\nbriefly by one their teachers in England\nand Germany, then interpreted at\nhome in Kamchatka. Their work was\nremarkable, especially considering the\nRussian lack of exposure to Western\ndance developments throughout the\nlast century. Beth Soil, Boston- based\nchoreographer, said, \"They claimed to\nwork within the [Martha] Graham\naesthetic, but you could see that their\nlyrical way of approaching Graham\nmade it something else. They reminded\nme of birch trees....\"\nJeanne Ruddy had also highly recommended\nthe Provincial Dance\nCompany from Ekaterinburg, Russia.\nWe had several middle-of-the-night\nphone conversations while I was still in\nAmerica. They were excited about\nattending, yet chose to withdraw the\nweek of the festival. We were unable\nto meet their demands for extremely\nlarge amounts of yellow sand (from\nwhere? how to move it?) for the stage.\nThey also wanted the stage to be painted\nbefore their arrival in alternating\nblack and white panels. Their withdrawal\nwas a great disappointment.\nThey did travel to the American Dance\nFestival in Durham, North Carolina last\nsummer where they were able to have\ntheir stage demands met and were well\nreceived as an avant-garde movement\nperformance group.\nThe local participants from the\nYaroslavl region were mostly ballet and\ntraditional Narodnaya (People's) Folk\nDance. Since there were few individuals\nin our Western group from traditional\ndance backgrounds, especially\nballetic traditions, I was nervous about\nfinding well-matched counterparts for\nthem. Margot Mink Colbert, director of\nBallet Colbert in Nevada, observed that\n\"it was not within the scope of the First\nInternational Festival of Movement and\nDance on the Volga to connect with the\nmainstream ballet world, but instead to\nexplore the work of unaffiliated creative\nartists, including smaller ballet\ncompanies and artists doing experimental\nwork.\" The festival was a significant\nevent for everyone in that it\ndramatically underlined the cultural\nand attitudinal differences that Americans\nand Russians have toward dance.\nThe Post Gallery came to the Concern\n\"IKAR\" office several days before\nthe festival started and asked to do a\nperformance. They were a group of\nmale artists who had been underground\n(literally, in a basement space\nbehind several locked doors) since well\nbefore Glasnost. They showed a work\nof performance art that related to their\nrather nationalistic interests, often\ntongue in cheek and quite genuine, in\nexploration and expression of the previously\nbanned Orthodox religion. They\nwere interested in ritual, even had\ndeveloped their own manifesto. One of\ntheir members had composed an opera\nabout Pugo, one of the leaders of the\ncoup that attempted to overthrow\nGorbachev. (Pugo committed suicide.\nThe rest have since been released from\nprison.)\n'The aspect of the festival that most\ncaptured my imagination was the opportunity\nit provided for independent\nartists and choreographers to show\neach other their work. It was fascinating\nto watch the emergence of the Russian\nunderground art scene that I had\npreviously only glimpsed over the past\nten years/' Margot said.\nThere was also a group of teenage\nboys and girls from Pereslavl-Zaleski,\nRussia, who performed in hip-hop\nstyle to American rap music They had\nwatched videotapes and created their\nown choreography, an unusual blend\nof their interpretation of the dance\nstyle with an strong, utterly recognizable\nRussian quality of solidity and\npride to their movement.\nNorth American and European\nChoreographers\nThe North American and European\nchoreographers' works represented\nboth new and traditional trends in\nWestern dance. Since there were twenty-five\nWestern participants, each of\nwhom had much to offer, I will describe\nonly some of them and their\nofferings in order to provide a feel for\nthe range of abilities and interests.\n• Aria Edry, artistic director of Kinetic\nEnvironments Company based in New\nYork City, taught a workshop called\nCellular Movement Exploration and\ndid a solo performance.\n• Eleanora Allerdings, a German performer\nfrom Holland, performed her\nchoreography, Piece on F...\n• Jane Bulger, a Boston-based artist\nand co-founder of the Abydos Movement\nCollective, led a group of performers\nfrom different countries in the\ncreation of a collaborative movement/\nperformance work performed at\nthe end of the festival.\n• Susanne Brian, a German artist, presented\nher new choreographic work,\nThe Blind, a trio with German artists\nBabette Kunze and Rebekka Torp, inspired\nterlinck.\n• Patricia Adams, artistic co-director of\nDances by Isadora dance company,\nbased in Foxborough, Mass., taught\nand performed a concert with ten-year-\nold Katya Golubkova, whom she had\nmet in Moscow the previous January at\nan Isadora Duncan Retrospective.\n• Maigot Mink Colbert, assistant\nchair, Department of Dance Arts, University\nof Nevada, Las Vegas, performed\na solo accompanied by two\nRussian jazz musicians, and co-led,\nwith Achmed Valk, an improvisatory\nworkshop that culminated in a cross-\ncultural performance.\n• Mary Ganzon, an artist from Austin,\nTexas, taught Contact Improvisation\nand a workshop entitled Unfolding the\nBody's Story, and performed a solo\ninspired by Kaspar Hauser.\n• Kathryn Labelle of Vancouver,\nconsidered one of Canada's leading\ndance artists, performed solo works\nand taught classes in modem dance\ntechnique.\n• Gloria Llompart, a dance artist from\nPuerto Rico, attended with her seven-\nteen-year-old daughter, photographer\nAlexia Rodriguez. Gloria taught a\nmovement workshop in a style rooted\nin investigations of improvisational\nforms, Caribbean rhythms, and interactive\nresponses. She also choreographed\na cross-cultural group piece\nthat was performed at the festival.\n• Marian Sarach, a dance artist from\nNew York City, who had just returned\nfrom a year of teaching modem dance\nat the Prague Conservatory of Dance\nand at the Academy of Performing\nArts, taught Contact Improvisation and\nperformed solo works.\n• Beth Soil, director of the Boston-\nbased Beth Soil & Company, gave a\nlecture on the \"Relationship of Movement\nand Meaning\" and taught a\nworkshop on the Interdependence of\nTechnique, Improvisation, and Composition.\nShe performed a concert of solo\nworks. This included the solo Zerkolo-\nMirror, based upon her sense of the\nimpact of her Russian heritage on her\ncreative work.\n• Achmed Valk, director of dance at\nKansas State University, Manhattan,\nKansas, presented his recently finished\nvideodance project, ENTROPY—REVERSE\nTO OMEGA, and co-taught\nwith Margot Mink Colbert a workshop\nin nontraditional movement composition\nthat culminated in performance.\nHe also performed in an improvisational\ntrio with Margot and Kathryn\nLaBelle.\nSeveral participants, whom people\nin Yaroslavl eagerly awaited, were unable\nto attend for various reasons and\nwere sorely missed. I heard their\nnames mentioned on the street and in\nfestival audiences by Russians who had\nread the newspaper publicity about\nthem and hungrily anticipated their\narrival.\nThe Future\nOne of my goals for the festival\nwas the development of future projects\nbetween participants. I wanted to\nprovide an opportunity for artists to\nmeet, collaborate, and continue to build\nupon their relationships, both personally\nand professionally. This goal is\nbeing realized with a number of projects.\nMargot Mink Colbert and Achmed\nValk oversaw the editing of twenty-two\nhours of videotape taken by festival\nvideographer Brian Leonard from Austin,\nTexas. Mary Ganzon also worked\non the project. This independently\ninitiated and produced documentary\nwas completed in the spring of 1994\nand is being distributed by Achmed\n(see ad in this issue).\nAn artistic exchange is in the planning\nstages between the Kontrasty\nDance Theatre from Kamchatka, Beth\nSoil and myself.\nPatricia Adams of Dances by Isadora,\nalong with Svetlana Dilmukoe-\nova, director of Music School n.l in\nYaroslavl, will begin a performance\ntour of performing arts schools on the\nGolden Ring and in Moscow in April\n1995.\nIt is my wish to make the festival a\nbiennial event and to shift its location\nto different areas in Russia and the\nformer Soviet Union. I am attempting\nto move the 1996 festival to St. Petersburg,\nor possibly to Perm, Russia (in\nthe Urals). It is also my hope to gain\nmore financial backing for my projects,\nas organizing a festival alone is an\nexhausting undertaking!\nFarewells\nOn the last night of the festival we\nhad a farewell banquet, Russian style,\nwith lots of dancing, vodka, speechmaking,\nand dinner. The next day everyone\nloaded up into a large bus for\nthe long trip to the Moscow Airport. It\nwas a sad time, as people said their\ngoodbyes and exchanged addresses. I\nwas exhausted, wracked with many\ndifferent emotions, and feeling self-\ncritical about what I felt I hadn't accomplished\nduring the festival. A\nyoung woman named Anya shyly\ncame up to me. I had met Anya in a\ncrowded restaurant/bar earlier in the\nweek. She and her friends had invited\nme and my friends to share their table\nsince there were no empty tables.\nComplete strangers, they expressed\ngreat interest and excitement in the\nfestival, and by coincidence they were\ndancers. I invited them to come to\nclasses and to meet people.\nOn the last day when Anya came\nup to me she told me that getting to\ntake classes, meet people, and be a part\nof the festival was the best thing that\nhad ever happened to her.

    "Abstract": "Rosalyn Driscoll discusses her approach to creating tactile sculptures designed to be experienced through touch. She explores the differences between visual and tactile perception, emphasizing how touch engages the body and evokes memories and feelings. The sculptures are designed to stimulate movement and invite a direct, intimate relationship with the artwork, functioning as scores for improvisation.",
    "Content": "A man embraces a bronze\ncube, laying his cheek on the smooth\nedge, eyes closed. A woman leans\nagainst a steel slab, one hand slowly\ntracing its surface. They are exploring\nsculptures made to be touched as well\nas seen.\nA few years ago I conceived the\nnotion of making tactile sculpture.\nThis direction in my work evolved out\nof working in handmade paper and\nmore recently with book forms, which\nhave to be handled to be known. It\nwas a small but radical step to consider\ntouch as integral to the aesthetics of\nthe work. I knew little about tactile\nperception, so I began research which\nled naturally to working with people\nwho are blind, in particular with\nDiedre Muccio, a woman who had\ntrained as a visual artist before losing\nher sight. We worked closely for a\nyear, exploring my own work and artwork\nin museums, inquiring into the\nprocess and nature of tactile perception,\nand kept journals of our experiences\n(see “Eyes and Hands” following).\nThe first sculptures I made used a\nvariety of durable, sensuous materials\n(bronze, wood, steel, leather, paper) to\nengage the senses and to satisfy different\nperceptual tastes. They are designed\nto work with the natural abilities\nand anatomies of shoulders, arms,\nwrists, hands, and fingers to stimulate\na range of movements and to explore\nthe dual nature of touching—our left\nand right sides.\nVisual and tactile aspects are made\nto be equal in integrity and interest.\nBecause sight and touch yield such\ndifferent information, I had to learn to\nthink with my hands as well as my\neyes, rather like learning to speak two\nlanguages at once, languages that don’t\nshare all the same words.\nAt the beginning, I was determined\nto have a tactile equivalent for every\nvisual phenomenon. This proved to be\ndifficult. For example, I didn’t know\nhow to make tactile versions of color.\nI soon abandoned the notion of tactile\nand visual correspondences, realizing\nhow different the two modes are.\nTouch reveals different qualities\nand realities than sight, sometimes\ncorresponding, sometimes conflicting,\nsometimes just different. Texture,\ntemperature, and surface modulations\noften go undetected by the eye.\nShapes and spaces take on different\naspects when felt by hands. This is a\nfully three-dimensional experience.\ntravelling over and around an\nobject, we have a more vivid spatial\nand kinesthetic understanding. The\nbody is engaged. Feelings arise from\ndifferent places within us.\nLike a very small, subtle dance,\ntouching an artwork awakens our\nbodies to the world at hand. Underneath\nthe sensuous surfaces lies an\ninvitation to attend to the body’s ways\nof knowing, often unexercised and\nunconscious. One woman, on approaching\nthe sculptures with her eyes\nclosed, felt anxious—how would she\nknow?—and then, at the first touch,\nshe felt joy at the knowing.\nTouch provides a direct, intimate\nrelationship with the artwork. Meanings\nare based in movements and\nsensations. Unlike the distance inherent\nin looking, by touching, we join\nthe sculpture, sometimes briefly assuming\nthe qualities of the object:\nfeeling, for example, tall and thin as\nwe touch a tall, thin sculpture, or\nspacious inside as we explore an interior\nspace, or balanced as we find a\nsymmetrical pattern. Often the object\nsuggests specific associations and\nmemories, and sometimes it is the\nvery motion of touching that evokes\nmemories or feelings associated with\nthat motion, like playing an instrument,\nor making love.\nI constantly bear in mind the anatomy\nand kinesiology of fingers, hands\nand arms as I work on the sculptures.\nHow different it is to feel something\nbetween both hands or to use each\nhand independently; to keep a straight\nline from elbow to fingertips or to\nbend and rotate at the wrist; to move\nhorizontally or vertically; to travel\nalong a surface or through space. The\nsculptures are like scores for improvisation,\ndesigned to provoke a range of\nmovements.\nI set three sculptures into a small\nexhibition called “The Art of Touch,”\nwhich is travelling to art museums. At\nthe exhibit, sighted people are offered\nblindfolds or invited to close their\neyes, not to simulate blindness, but to\nfocus on touch. By touching the\nartwork before seeing it, the viewer is\nin the novel situation of coming to\nknow a complex work of art solely\nthrough touch. Viewers who wear the\nblindfold or close their eyes give up\nthe control and certainty provided by\nsight, a condition that sharpens our\nattention and awareness, bringing us\nback into our bodies and into our\ninternal, private selves. Released from\nthe literalism of sight, the imagination\nis free to enter in, with fewer boundaries\nlimiting its play. As our hand\nmoves along a groove on a surface,\nnot knowing where or how it will end,\nit seems endless, the way an unfamiliar\nroad always seems longer. The\nimagination leaps into this time-space\nof not knowing, ready to elaborate,\nassociate, or even invent scenarios.\nOne woman’s hand reached a position\ninside a sculpture where she wasn’t\ntouching any surfaces. Instantly, she\nfelt herself in a void, standing in the\nwind on a mesa.\nWe tend to attribute objectivity\nand certainty to sight, but when we\nhave a tactile image of a sculpture that\nis very different from the visual one,\nas people who use the blindfold often\ndo, we realize we are creating our own\nversion of the object. We realize that\nsight does not tell the whole story or\nthe only story. As one viewer described\nhis experience, “By touching\nthe sculptures before seeing them, I\nhave the opportunity to juxtapose the\ntwo realities, to feel them as equal in\nweight.” One woman felt, with eyes\nclosed, the rectangular, architectural\ncontours of one piece, and pictured a\nforest with a mossy floor. She was\nastonished to open her eyes to an\nordered, geometric structure. In this\nsimple, direct way people often grasp\nthe creative nature of perception.\nEach person responds differently to\neach sculpture and to the tactile experience,\nbringing his or her particular\nhistory and ways of being to the encounter.\nEveryone moves in a unique\nway, notices different parts, prefers\ndifferent textures, even imagines different\nstructures. People have pictured\nthe same stepped wooden surface as\ncanyon walls, Islamic garden, urban\nlandscape.\nPeople approach the process of\ntactually exploring a sculpture in different\nways. I have discerned two\nmain modes, which I call mapping and\nsensing. Mapping is building a coherent\nimage of the forms and structures,\nobserving locations, relations and\ndimensions. Sensing is feeling sensations\nand qualities without concern for\nthe overall image. While mapping and\nsensing are not mutually exclusive,\nthey do seem to have a figure-ground\nrelationship: a viewer is primarily in\none mode or the other at any given\nmoment. One man (blindfolded) agonized\nover trying to see with his\nhands, to create a visual image. Finally\nhe gave up and accepted what his\nhands had to offer, dropping into a\ndeep experience of sensation.\nComing to know an object through\ntouch happens over time, in a slow,\nlinear, cumulative gathering of information,\nlike watching dance or listening\nto music. Looking takes time too,\nbut our eyes move so swiftly, with\nsuch little effort, that we aren’t usually\naware of the process. So different is\nthis pace from the relatively instantaneous\ngrasp of sight that some people\nhave an altered sense of time. Space\ntakes on the face of time.\nBecause seeing and the seen carry\nsuch authority in our culture, this\nexperience offers a needed balance. In\nhis book on coming to terms with his\nblindness, Touching the Rock, John\nHull concludes, “A blind person is\nsimply someone in whom the specialist\nfunction of sight is now devolved upon\nthe whole body, no longer specialized\nin a particular organ.” He refers to\nhimself as a “whole-body-seer.” Overdependent\nas we are on sight, we need\nto learn more about whole-body seeing.\nAt its most profound, this experience\nchallenges the hegemony of the\nself we locate in the eyes and brain.\nWe are engaged physically, drawing\non our bodily knowing. This work\noffers a small antidote to the increasingly\ndisembodied lives our technology\nand our education are shaping,\nopening us to new—though really very\nold—ways of knowing and being. ★\n\nComments:\n\nIt resembles an experience I had in the\npast, a feeling of being lost in a\ndream. This experience is very fundamental,\nvery basic, or primitive, different\nfrom more intellectual experiences\nor even emotional ones. It’s more\ndirect, therefore it’s stronger.\nI’ve never had a sense of rhythm in art\nbefore, my hands moving in time.\nMakes me think of Sankai Juku, the\nJapanese theater troupe, the way\nthings appear on the margins, the way\nthings unfold into something else.\nThe scale is fixed with sight; in the\nimagination it can be very big or very\nsmall.\nThere is no physical reality. Not only\non a psychic level is the world plastic\nand not concrete, but physically as\nwell. On a feeling level, things exist\ncompletely differently than visually.\nto juxtapose those two realities,\nto feel them as equal in weight.\nThere was a visual field of darkness\nwith the blindfold. As soon as my\nhands went inside the opening, the\nvisual field suddenly went much blacker,\nlike from charcoal grey to velvet\nblack.\nSuch a dynamic experience, very deep\nwith curiosity and anxiety.\nThere are so many emotions attached\nto the closeness and innocence of\ntouch.\nI was surprised to find such pleasure\nin hard edges, square corners; it\nemphasized the organicness of my\nbody. I felt huge in relation to their\nscale, and not human.\nI used both hands, outside hand trying\nto make sense in relation to the inside\nhand; pleasure in finding hands join.\nI never considered touching in another\natmosphere than the intimate.\nI got closer to the artist’s process in\nthe studio; the artist touches all the\ntime.\nWow! What an experience! I lost all\nsense of balance. Very strange. I\nfound myself only being able to use\none hand, not both—too much information.\nI remember them kinesthetically but\nnot so much visually, and I usually\nhave a strong visual memory. I remember\na very deep hole in one, and\ngoing down that hole, but it didn’t\nlook that deep. What I remember is\nthe way it felt, not the way it looked.\nThe experience of these pieces is like\ndry leaves at the point of breaking. It\nwas exciting to my body, that is also\nmind, to be with the sculptures.\nOne of them was like swimming in a\nlake—not knowing what was on the\nbottom. I wanted to jump in the water\nagain and again.\nThe room is burnished in a kind of\nlight, and the pieces are burnished in\nthe eyes-closed place.\nBefore my husband and I were married\nI would close my eyes and touch\nhis body, his face, so if something\nhappened where I wouldn’t see him\nagain, his image would remain in my\nhands, in my body and mind. This\nexhibit reminded me of this experience.\nVery meaningful and memorable.\nIt is part of me.\nI had visually explored the sculptures\na month ago, and so knew what the\nforms were. Going through without\nsight, the forms seem much larger,\ndeeper and wider.\nI had a moment of rest, like touching\na woman’s body, a sense of peace and\nease. I realized kinesthetic peace is\nmore real to me than visual.\nOrdinary objects will never feel the\nsame again.\nHow lively in the gallery—everyone\ntalking through his or her discovery.\nI was struck by the intensity of the\nsmells.\nIt’s like the difference between seeing\nthe movie and reading the book.\n\n\n\nEyes and hands\nThe following was written by Rosalyn Driscoll, a visual artist and creator\nof The Art of Touch exhibition, and Diedre Muccio, who trained as an\nartist before becoming blind, to describe their collaborative exploration\nof the perceptual processes involved in being with art\nRO Z: A few years ago I conceived the notion o f making sculpture that can be touched, sculpture\nthat asks tactile questions as well as visual. I knew little about tactile perception, so I sought out\nthe experts: people who are blind. By great good fortune I found a woman who had been trained\nas a visual artist before losing her sight to an inherited retinal disorder. We agreed to work together\nto investigate tactile perception and the development o f aesthetic touch.\nDIED RE: After art school, I had plunged into a world of half-deciphered shadows. As the visual\nrealm slipped away, so did the excitement and pleasure I had always taken in the world around me,\nperceived and interpreted through my eyes and endlessly transformed in my mind into images of my\nown creation. The balance between beauty and horror was tipped to the dark side, leading me to\nmistrust my remaining senses and judgment. After a difficult fifteen years of adapting to this cultural\nand psychological deprivation, a gateway to the old fascination opened as Roz and i began to work\ntogether and I once more started to think about the function of art and my place w ithin that w orld.\nBecause I wanted to make my work accessible to people who are blind as well as sighted, I needed\nto know how a work of art is read by touch alone: what effect different materials have; what effect\nsize has; how connections are made from part to part; whether abstract art can be meaningful; how\nmeaning is formed; if and how images are made from touching; how tactile information relates to\nvisual information.\nW e began by my evaluating Roz's sculpture from a tactile point of view , giving her feedback on what\nmade sense, what was interesting, and even what was disagreeable. These pieces, w hich were not\nmade with tactile viewing in mind, were difficult for me. In one sculpture my hands couldn't travel\nfo r long without running into metal slabs; it was aggravating to encounter the blockage and made me\nwant to remove my hands from the whole piece.\nWe traveled to art museums to explore a wide variety o f sculptures through touch, and to observe\ndifferent museum experiences. She touched, usually with gloves on, reporting her experience as I\ntook notes.\nDiedre was extremely articulate, detailed, and candid in describing what worked and didn't\nwork for her and why, what effect different sculptures and parts o f sculptures had on her, and what\nassociations, images, and questions arose for her.\nSometimes I was also allowed to touch, and we could compare our impressions. I was often\nastonished how different the tactile images were from the visual, such as a David Smith sculpture o f\naluminum cubes stacked at odd angles: cool, hard, rational volumes to the eye, but to the hand,\nunexpectedly warm, sensuous surfaces with mysterious spaces between the cubes.\nI was often frustrated in trying to understand what was under my hands. A Picasso head had ears,\nmouth, eyes, and hair that were anything but in proportion and hardly decipherable to my touch. A\nlarge classical figure was too big to make sense of the whole; I had to trace the shapes from some\nrecognizable reference point, like a foot.\n\n\nTo my surprise, Diedre had to learn how to touch art, just as I did. Aesthetic touching is not a\ncommon activity for anyone, blind or sighted, and requires skills that can be learned, just as visual\nskills can be. She learned to take time, to move through frustration, to keep exploring even after\nidentifying what something was, and I had to learn to trust this new sense to provide its own\nmeanings, perhaps quite different from the visual meanings.\nI noticed my impressions would often change from moment to moment. First a surface felt convex\nthen immediately concave; sometimes the same surface felt silky and then rough and dry. How does\none “know\" what something is? The lack of fixity alarmed and perplexed me, but Roz and other\nartists said this is the nature of experience. I remembered that I once felt this way, and now must\nagain become used to this flux, this time as experienced through touch.\nWe tried to track the process in the moment of erception: exactly how did she come to understand\nthe object? Do different kinds of information come from different ways of touching? How much is\njust pleasure in the sensations and how much is figuring out the forms and relationships?\nI began to develop a method of exploring the works, especially the larger sculptures whose parts were\nharder to make out. I learned to go beyond identification of parts to a feeling for the aesthetic\npossibilities and meaning. Touching an Indian sculpture in sandstone evoked the smell of desert sands\nand delicate spices, the figure made me think of a living woman, not an inanimate object.\nI learned that the more time I gave to a piece the easier it was to let it grow on me and even get\nunder my skin. After casual exploration of a smooth abstract bronze, I was ready to leave it, but on\nbeing encouraged to persist, I gave it all I could, soon falling into a rhythm with the flow of its lines,\nand it took me on a roller coaster ride.\nSometimes after leaving a museum after two hours of touching, I felt intoxicated, compelled to\ntouch everything around me. I would hold these sculptures in memory like a storehouse of interesting\nobjects I could continue to turn over in my mind.\nI wrote about my experience after each session, documentation that provided useful feedback for\ndocents and educators in the museums as well as articulating our findings and questions for ourselves.\nAs I developed models of new sculptures, Diedre would feel them to let me know what was\nunpleasant, confusing, or overly complex. Her responses gave me clarity about how to proceed;\nand new ideas for solutions to problems.\nThese collaborative perceptual investigations led to my making a series of three tactile sculptures\nwhich now form a small travelling exhibition, The Art of Touch. Our work together was essential to\nthe making of these sculptures, the structure of the exhibition, and to my ongoing work as a\nsculptor. I now include tactile considerations and questions in all my work, which I find both limits\nand immeasurably enriches my choices, giving the work fuller dimensions.\nI have come to feel that sculpture, as tactually experienced, is an exciting medium for transmitting\nthe kinds of ideas I had always believed only a visual image could contain. I no longer feel at a loss\nto live life fully, with the artistic world once more returned to me through tactile perception, with its\npotential for exploring new forms, and for triggering rediscovery of all the forgotten and neglected\nforms common to our experience of art and of life itself.",

    "Abstract": "This article reflects on the parallels between choreographic processes and mountain climbing, drawing from the author's relocation to Seattle and their experiences integrating dance with outdoor recreation. It explores how the challenges and rewards of climbing mountains inspire movement imagery and aesthetic risk-taking in dance. The author highlights the shared characteristics of both activities, such as the importance of perseverance, improvisation, and individual contribution.",
    "Content": "choreographic processes\nAfter years of living and working in the Midwest,\nmy life/dance partner J. Meredith (Marty) Ponte and I\ndecided to relocate to the Seattle area in July, 1993. As a\n“thirtysomething” with several years of university dance\nteaching experience behind me, moving to Seattle seemed a\nrisky, at times intimidating, prospect. On the other hand, a\nlarge part of our decision was based on a desire to integrate\nour dance, body therapies and outdoor/recreation\npassions. Seattle’s small, self-contained neighborhoods,\nmountain views, international music scene and innumerable\nfolksy coffee houses combine to create a sense of expansiveness\nunusual for a large city. A move to the “Emerald\nCity” seemed like an affirmation, had the potential to help\nus start a new chapter of our lives, one which would elicit\nthe best from us and encourage us to grow.\nSeattle is a city whose “aura” is a million shades of\ngray. Constantly shifting clouds and mists unveil mountains\nand waterways, ever-changing vistas seen from various\nvantage points in our urban village. A full year has\npassed since our move, and in retrospect, we acknowledge\nthat it has taken a full year for our souls to arrive where\nour bodies have long become acclimated. To hasten this\nprocess, we’ve been undertaking new choreographic adventures,\nperforming our work for highly appreciative audiences,\nand pursuing careers in dance education and kinetic\nsciences.\nA favored way for us to relax, revel in and explore the\noutlying environs quickly presented itself; every weekend\nwe would pick a different mountain to climb. The Cascade\nand Olympic Ranges are within an hour’s drive of our\napartment. Although some would counsel against dancers\nparticipating in extracurricular sports/fitness activities\nwhich might endanger their ability to dance, we had the\nopposite experience: what started as a casual pastime has\nafforded us many dance-affirming experiences. Climbing\nthrough old growth forests, skirting glacial shapes, examining\nspooky, hanging mosses and passing a waterfall taller\nthan Niagara have inspired movement imagery which could\nnever be experienced in a dance studio. The aerobic demands\nof climbing 7,000 feet, including walking through\nknee deep snowfields in sometimes near-freezing temperatures,\nhave made barre work and partnered lifts seem easy.\nThe demands and rewards of exploring the open range\ninspire further aesthetic risk taking, making us more daring\nin our improvisations.\n\nDuring the course of an early climb up Crystal Mountain,\nnear the border of Mt. Rainier National Park, I was\nstruck by the similarities between our two choices for\nphysical expression: choreography and mountain climbing.\nSome of these common characteristics are:\n♦ The hardest part is getting started. No amount of\npreparation nor discussion can substitute for the process\nitself, the initially arduous, sometimes tentative,\ninvigorating, ultimately rewarding, step-by-step process.\n♦ More importantly, you have to love the process\nitself—every footfall, every bend in the trail, every\nchoreographic detour and experiment, every twisted\nswitchback and every new phrase of movement\nwhich reveals itself to you.\n♦ This can only be undertaken by you. Even though\nfellow climbers/artistic collaborators are helpful, the\ncontribution of the individual is key in the choreo-\ngraphic/climbing process.\n♦ Initial inspiration, preparation and energy for a\nclimb/choreographic project are important for getting\nstarted. But in the long run, making it “to the top”\ncan only be accomplished by perseverance, a strong\nconstitution, ingenuity, strength of will and a vision.\n♦ Flexibility of climbing plans and willingness to improvise\nmake the journey more enjoyable, serendipitous,\nincreasing the possibilities for new discoveries.\n♦ While on the trail(s) and in the studio, I’ve noticed\nthat everyone works at their own pace. Body types,\ntemperament and individual metabolism may have an\ninfluence on this pacing. Some climbers/creators\nforge ahead, constantly focusing on and anticipating\nthe goal. Others meander slowly, enjoying the\nclimb, savoring the unique aspects of each moun-\ntain/dance. There is great value and significance in\ndiscovering one’s own pace of moving.\n♦ There is a spirit of camaraderie common to both\nclimbers and dancemakers, a spirit bom of the patience\nand resolve required to see the project\nthrough. Afflictions such as sore muscles, bug bites,\nabrasions and bruised egos (while attempting unfamiliar\nmovements or mountains) create bonds\namongst the participants.\nTo feel a sense of tangible accomplishment, we have, of\nlate, been keeping a list of mountains we have climbed.\nConcurrently, we’ve been keeping a separate, detailed list\nof dance repertory we’ve created. We found that it was\ndifficult to remember and list dances chronologically.\nWhat appears as a single title on a page was the culmination\nof an adventure which required months of convoluted\nrehearsal schedules, frantic musical research, and endless\nexperimentation. Yet, looking at our list, all these dances\nseem to have the life span of a soap bubble.\nPerhaps that is why mountain climbing appeals to us:\nthat feeling of exhilaration one has at arriving at the moun-\ntaintop after hours of tramping up the trail, confers a simple,\ndistilled, and peaceful gratification. One can achieve\nthis so rarely in dance! Maybe this can be experienced\nduring an opening night reception, or perhaps at a dress\nrehearsal when one can see that a dance “holds together”\nor “takes on a life of its own.” Or sometimes during an\nimprov, the intention and intuition of a moment synergis-\ntically combine to create forces which are palpable, a\nconfluence of energies made visible. Achieving a sense of\naccomplishment in dance may be all the more rewarding\nfor its rarity and intensity.\nScanning our mountain and dance lists conjures images\nof faces and places, feelings of new muscles and mountains,\nand most vividly, lessons learned. Not only do we\nlearn more about our craft, we become more concise and\nclear about what we have to say. Each mountain/dance is\na step in a journey, which, at its core, is a process of learning\nabout oneself, a path which circles back to the empty\nstudio and the bottom of the trail, eager to start again.",

    "Content": "Festival of mixed ability dance in N.Y.C. \nMobility Junction moves fast.\nIn December 1993, the New York City\nmixed ability dance group performed\nfor the first time. One year later,\nMobility Junction organized an international\nfestival of mixed ability dance\nfrom December 2 to 4 in New York\nCity. The festival included a performance,\na two-day dance workshop and\na symposium, \"Dance and Disabilities:\nChallenging our Concepts of Dance,\nCommunication and Beauty.\" The\nfestival was organized by Teri Carter,\nand co-sponsored by Movement\nResearch, in conjunction with the\n3rd Annual Improvisation Festival\nNY/1994.\nMobility Junction (MJ) is directed\nin 1993. MJ has a performance company\nof seven dancers with different\nphysical abilities. The members are\nlone Beauchamp, Kumhee Hong, Bruce\nJackson, Elliot Schloss, Scott Waldron,\nand myself.\nMobility Junction is the first and\nonly mixed ability dance project in\nNew York. The group is actively\nbuilding a community of students and\nsupporters and informing the public\nabout our work. The festival was MJ's\nmost ambitious interaction with the\npublic so far.\nMJ has been perceived as marginal,\nchallenging and scary to dancers. One\nof the goals of the festival was to reach\nout to the New York dance community.\n\"I'm interested in that 'dancer's block'\nto dancing with people with disabilities,\"\nsaid Scott Waldron. \"A lot of\nable-bodied dancers tell me they are\nnot the slightest bit interested in this\nwork.\" Organizing the Mobility Junction\nFestival in conjunction with the\nlarger Improvisation Festival/NY was\na way to make it easily accessible to\ndancers involved with the Improvisation\nFestival.\nReaching out to people who are\ndisabled was also a priority of the\nMobility Junction Festival. In the past,\nMJ worked primarily with disabled\npeople who were already performers\nor athletes. Now the group is establishing\ncontact with people with disabilities\nwho don't have this previous\nexperience.\nInvolving people with disabilities\nin mixed ability dance can be difficult:\nTake me for example, I have a disability,\nand for a long time I never\nnoticed I could dance. Many people,\nespecially disabled people, are\nnot open to dance. They are afraid\nto show their bodies to other people.\nMany disabled people stay at home,\nand they are isolated. There is no\ndisabled community in New York.\nHow do we find these people?\n-Kumhee Hong\nMJ has tried a variety of publicity\ntactics. The most effective approach\nhas been the most basic one, a grassroots\neffort of encouraging friends to\nget involved, passing out fliers on the\nstreet and speaking to disabled people\nin public places.\nMobility Junction is pioneering\nmixed ability dance in New York, but\nmixed ability dance has been happening\nfor several years all over the world.\nMJ's work has been especially influenced\nWest Coast of the U.S., including\nDanceAbility workshops organized by\nAlito Alessi and Karen Nelson, and\nDiverse Dance Research Retreats organized\nFor the festival we invited Lori B\nand Riccardo Morrison of California,\nand Stina K. Bollman and Contact 17 of\nHamburg, Germany to perform and\nteach. Lori and Riccardo have performed\nand taught in mixed groups,\nand Stina is the founder and director of\nContact 17, a mixed abilities group\nincluding Jo Apel, Sandra Doehren,\nMichael Hering, Heike Wamdtke, and\nothers. Contact 17 performed with live\nmusic by Station 17 at the festival.\nThe festival performance was an\nentire evening of mixed ability contact\ndance. Contact 17 performed an improvised\nmovement structure which\nhighlighted dancers' specific physical\ncapabilities. There was also the suggestion\nof theatrical characters in their\nwork. In an opening duet, Sandra\nexplored Stina's body with her hand.\nSandra's body stayed in place, while\nStina rolled the touch along her head,\narms and back. Sandra is most mobile\nin her hands and arms and she uses a\nwheelchair, Stina is able-bodied. The\nduet showed patience and interest by\nboth dancers in the exploration of the\nphysical possibilities of their dancing.\nTeri Carter remarked:\nThere are amazing problems to solve\nartistically in this dancing. I look\nfor the realness in it, the physics,\nhow people make choices. Sometimes\npeople look for impossible\nfinesse. I look for what is possible\nand impossible, and how people\nmove out of touch situations, like\nhow you fall—even if it's only two\ninches—if your hands are doing\nsomething and you can't use your\nlegs to support you.\nPatience and acceptance of physical\nlimitations are qualities of dancing\nwhich Stina has struggled to feeL At\nthe festival symposium panel, she stated\nthat boredom was one of her main\nchallenges in dancing with disabled\npeople as the pace of the dancing was\nconsistently slow. However, she's\nfound that by slowing down, she's\nfinding movement which really interests\nher.\nAble-bodied and disabled dancers,\ndisabled and disabled dancers, able-\nbodied and able-bodied dancers combined\nin trios, duets and quartets during\nMobility Junction's festival performance.\nSome combinations are more\ncomfortable to members of the group\nthat} others:\nI worry when I dance with other\ndisabled people. I don't feel supported\nand I have been hurt. It takes a\nlong time to learn about each other.\n-Kumhee Hong\nMixed ability dancers have extensive\nexperience with fear and taking\nrisks. Bruce Jackson expressed his\nawareness of risks in dancing when he\ntook a surprising fall at a Mobility\nJunction rehearsal. Bruce, who uses a\nprinted alphabet board to communicate,\nspelled out \"I live for danger\"\nafter the fall.\nDuring the festival symposium,\nLori B asked the panel what was challenging\nto them in dancing. Panel\nmembers mentioned fear as a part of\ntheir experience of dancing in mixed\ngroups. They mentioned fear of hurting\nothers and being hurt, of being\nclose to someone different and touching,\nand of showing their body to other\npeople.\nI support the idea of able-bodied\npeople using wheelchairs wholeheartedly.\nBlindfolds, too. Able-\nbodied people are intimidated and\nfrightened by wheelchairs. The\nwheelchair is a part of me. I like the\nidea that they want to learn all\nabout it. -Elliot Schloss\nThe workshop was team-taught by\nsix teachers: Teri Carter, lone Beauchamp,\nKumhee Hong, Stina Bollman,\nLori B and Riccardo Morrison. Each\nteacher planned a class independently,\nbut many shared the goal of setting up\na safe, comfortable situation for students\nto explore new and scary experiences,\nsuch as touching each other and\nsupporting the weight of another person.\nClasses included running tag\ngames, hands-on exploration of a partner'\ns musculature, moving with eyes\nclosed, and rolling with a partner.\nIn the workshop, I made efforts to\nallow for communication. Next\ntime we do a festival, I would like to\nbroaden the outlook, have community\nevents and meals and create\ntogether more. As it happened, the\nfestival pointed out gaps in communication.\n-lone Beauchamp\nMobility Junction members were\nchallenged by the festival as organizers,\ndancers, teachers and hosts. The\nfestival inspired future activity: the\nperformance group will rehearse weekly,\npracticing contact improvisation\nskills and creating new duets and trios\nfor performance. We hope to expand\nour activities to teaching children and\nperforming at new sites, such as residences\nfor people who are disabled. In\naddition, group members will travel\nthis spring to Diverse Dance Research\nRetreat on Vashon Island near Seattle,\nand to the DanceAbility Workshop in\nEugene, Oregon. Dancers will exchange\nideas and experiences with\nother mixed ability dancers and continue\nthe international relationships which\nwere a foundation of the festival.",

    "Content": "The performance of the Mobility\nJunction Festival on December 2,\n1994 was well attended. Lots of dancers,\neducators, social workers, physical\ntherapists. I came early to ask permission\nto use my camera. I saw the lineup\nof wheelchairs, felt the excitement\nand heard the band rehearsing. I\nwasn't sure what I would see.\nThe performance started. A mix of\nwheelchair dancers and upright dancers\nentered the stage. A lot of action:\nleaps over the wheelchairs, handstands\non the chairs. The people in chairs\nwhirled about, meeting each other,\nholding hands, making archways with\nthe other dancers leaping over and\nunder. In the foreground, the rest of\nthe dancers, without chairs, were on\nthe floor doing Contact—both able-\nbodied and not-so-able supporting and\nbeing supported as they danced together.\nThe band had a great beat which\nadded to the excitement. When the\npiece ended, there was a burst of applause.\nIt was good.\nIn another piece, a group of people\nseated in wheelchairs entered the stage.\nThey sat there for a minute... No one\nknew who would stand up. And who\nis to know your fate? Two stood up.\nThere was a duet between Riccardo\nMorrison and Bruce Jackson. Riccardo\nis a beautiful, strong, acrobatic, high\nenergy dancer. The contrast between\nhis prowess and Bruce's limited,\nthough poetic, movement (on the floor\nand on his knees), was upsetting to me.\nSuperimposed on my inner eye, I saw\nan image of Bruce upright and dancing\nabout. I found tears in my eyes.\nAltogether, it was an interesting\nperformance, well-choreographed, a\ncreative use of the mix of movement\navailable. The performers had a good\ntime and an exciting experience. They\nlooked gloriously happy during the\nperformance.\nIt wasn't so long ago that disabled\npeople were stuck up in the attic... In\n1990, the \"Americans with Disabilities\nAct\" was passed. In 1992 it took effect—sidewalks\nwere leveled, buses\nhad lifts, schools had desks at the right\nheight for wheelchairs. It is against the\nlaw to not provide access for a wheelchair\nperson.\n♦\nUpon asking people, \"Would you\nattend a performance of able and disabled\npeople (in wheelchairs) dancing?\"\nthese were their answers:\nMalvine C.: I wouldn't go. When I go to\na dance performance, I want to be inspired,\nuplifted, enhanced, reminded of the history\nof beauty and Art.\nElaine A.: I would go, but would be sad\nand suffer through it and feel sorry for the\ndisabled people. But it's great of them to\ndo it.\"\nMary A.: If the show is good, interesting,\nand I'll enjoy it, mobile or in wheelchairs,\ntell me when it comes up.\nPeter K.: Sometimes I go to a dance performance\nwhere some of the able dancers\nmove like they are disabled. That's very\ndisappointing to me. I enjoy seeing very\nwell-trained dancers, well-costumed, the\nstage ivell-lit, and so I would not like to\nsee disabled people perform.\nDavid D.: Chairs on wheels can do a lot\nof stuff. I've seen a lot of gyrations and\nmaneuvering with them. And if the mobile\ndancers are creative and do exciting choreography,\nit's fun for all participating. So\nif it's that, I would love to see it.\"\nRuth V.: I knew it was a good thing\nwhen the Olympics opened up competition\nfor disabled people, people in wheelchairs,\nso now there are wheelchair people dancing.\nWhen is the next performance? It\nshould be interesting.\nAlicia S.: I am old, so old, I can no longer\ndo the things I used to do and enjoy. I\ndon't like to see myself in the mirror and\nso I do not like to look at ago. And any\nother disability. (She thought for a minute\nthen asked), Are they young, the\nwheelchair people?\n(Yes, I answered.)\nAre they pretty?\n(Yes, I answered.)\nWell, they have a lot, youth and beauty,\nwhich I no longer have...\nNatanya W.: I very carefully choose to go\nto see the finest dance concerts, the most\nbeautiful dancers, the most interesting\nchoreography, even though it's expensive.\nI wish I was old enough to have seen Anna\nPavlova and Pavlov Nijinsky, sigh, sigh.\nNo, I would not go.\nDebby S.: When we watch disabled people,\nthere is a fear that such a fate could\nhappen to us, or to our loved ones or to\nour yet unborn. This makes me feel uncomfortable\nand I might choose not to face\nit. But still I am interested in this kind of\nperformance, I would like to attend.",

    "Content": "Thoughts after the first Contact Improvisation\nexperience between physically and\nmentally disabled and non-disabled people,\nwhich took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina\nwith Alito Alessi of DanceAbility\nduring October and November 1994.\n\n\nFor a moment, we get rid of\nour masks, our ego vanishes and we\nabandon ourselves to the dance to discover\nour likeness.\nLike children, we love\nFeeling safe enough, not to be hurt,\nwe give way to the dance of life...\nPeace, love and gentleness\nA journey into ourselves...\ninto communion.\nYou and I together, creating us\nA journey of revolution...\nBreaking solid rocks ..steel armors...\nand the best in you and me blooms.\n\n\nInclusion and exclusion are two\naspects that can be clearly seen in the\ndance. Exclusion of \"the other\" implies\nnot listening to our partner and is related\nto distrust, fear and defenses that\nwe build up due to that fear so we can\nprotect ourselves. Inclusion is linked to\ntrust, safety, giving, openness and\nlistening. The exclusion and the lack of\nlistening give way to the differences,\nwhereas, the inclusion allows us to find\nthe coincidence.\nDancing with disabled people can\nhelp us to realize how these attitudes\nwork in ourselves, in our daily life and\nin our dance. It allows us to face ourselves\nwith our own defenses, fears and\nprejudices in such a way that we can\nget rid of all that and let ourselves go\nentirely into the dance.\nWe are a community of individuals.\nIn spite of our differences, we all have\nmany things in common that bring us\ntogether: the capacity of feeling, sensing,\nsharing, communicating, expressing,\nloving and being loved, and dancing;\nas well as a certain degree of disability.\nIt may be neither physical nor\nmental but a disability of our heart\nrelated with openness, giving and receiving,\ncommunicating and expressing\nfreely from within, with sincerity, genuineness\nand authenticity.\nOne way that fear, distrust, and\ninsecurity are expressed is in the control\nand manipulation of another person.\nWorking with disabled people\nmade me aware of two possible attitudes.\nOn the one hand, a superiority\nand control position, in which we manipulate\n\"the other\" and we establish a\n\"vertical relationship.\" On the other\nhand, the awareness of our own body\nin a sensitive way establishes a \"horizontal\nrelationship\" from heart to\nheart\nDancing with disabled people has\ntaught me a lot in this way. It can take\nus away from the \"beautiful shapes\"\nand the \"big and acrobatic movements\"\nto regain the minimal and sensitive\nmovements. It allows us to\nrecover a humble attitude, simplicity,\nsensitivity and our own essence: our\nheart.",

    "Abstract": "This article reviews a five-day intensive workshop, \"Crash Course,\" led by Motionhouse artistic directors. The course combined rigorous physical training, set dance phrases emphasizing alignment and release, and structured partnered sequences derived from Contact Improvisation. The author reflects on their personal challenges and eventual satisfaction in learning the material and experiencing the company's unique approach to choreographic invention.",
    "Content": "Crash Course was just that—in\nboth senses of the word. It was five\ndays of intense physical training which\nincorporated the high energy dancing\nand risky partner work associated with\nthe so-called “Euro-Crash” style of\ndance/physical theatre. It was led by\nMotionhouse artistic directors Louise\nRichards and Kevin Finnan in July\n1994, in Leamington Spa, England.\nMy reactions to the course varied\nover the week. The days were comprised\nof three elements. To begin the\nmorning there were repetitive strengthening\nexercises for back, arms and\nabdominals. The company has developed\nthese as part of a daily training\nregime through an awareness (due to\nrepeated injuries) of the need for the\nupper body strength required to fulfill\nthe demands of their contact lifting-\nbased work. For me, these strenuous\nphysical jerks came as a bit of a shock\nto the system. However, my introduction\nto them proved timely, as I too\nhave developed a recent awareness of\nthe need to work with more muscular\n(as opposed to skeletal) awareness, in\norder to protect joints and prevent injury,\nprompted by an ongoing knee problem.\nThe second part of the morning was\ncomprised of learning set dance phrases\nwhich emphasised the head-tail relationship.\nAttention to alignment and release\nproduced flowing sequences spiralling\ninto and out of the floor. This presented\na particular challenge to me, for as\nan improviser, I experienced a strong\nresistance in mind and body to hold\nonto the material and get it right. By\nthe end of the week, however, a concerted\nmental and physical effort produced\nthe desired effect and I experienced\nthat unique satisfaction of having\ngotten through the whole phrase and\nfeeling the exhilaration of high-energy\nunison dancing.\nThe afternoons were given over to\nlearning set partnered sequences, using\nskills culled from Contact Improvisation,\nsuch as specific lifts and supports.\nThe frustration I experienced at learning\nthese movements in such a highly structured\nway was countered on the last day\nwhen we had the chance to choreograph\nour duet material and add improvised\nsections. Everything came together, the\nadvantages of a shared vocabulary and\nskill base to work with, within a freer\nimprovisational framework which produced\nsome really exciting dancing in\nthe final duets.\nCrash Course gave an insight into\nthe company’s unique approach. From\nContact Improvisation they have developed\na training method which facilitates\na particular style of choreographic invention\nusing partner work as its focus.\nIt was as ever a pleasure to experience\nthe teaching of Kevin and Louise which\nis delivered with clarity, energy and\nhumour, conveying a sense of their\nongoing enjoyment of moving. As\nKevin so eloquently put it, “Oh, the joy\nof Terpsichore!”",

    "Abstract": "This article discusses the issue of elitism and exclusion within the Contact Improvisation community, specifically at the Harbin New Year's Jam. It explores how certain individuals may feel excluded based on factors like experience, social standing, or perceived belonging, despite the community's intention of inclusivity. The authors aim to revive and broaden the dialogue around these often unspoken dynamics.",
    "Content": "Anne Aronov’s letter to CQ in Still\nMoving last issue [CQ Vol. 20:1, Win-\nter/Spring 95] fueled a discussion at the\nHarbin New Year’s Teacher’s Conference\nin California a couple of weeks\nago on the topic of the politics of hierarchy\namong teachers, students, and\norganizers in the contact community.\nJust as the bell rang to signify the end\nof the discussion period, it was decided\nthat the real root of the discontent was\nin the issue of inclusion and exclusion\nthat pervades the contact community,\nyet about which no one will dare talk.\nAnother discussion resulted at the Harbin\nNew Year’s Jam, a couple of days\nlater, to address this issue.\nBecause I was unable to attend that\ndiscussion, and because notes I read\nfrom it only grazed the surface of the\nissue, I’m writing in an effort to revive,\ncontinue, and broaden the dialogue.\nLet’s face it, we can’t get too content\nwith ourselves until after we trudge\nthrough a little muck.\nThis was my very first Harbin Jam\nand I had a very difficult time deciding\nto go. I had always been attracted to it\nand promised myself this time that I\nwould really do it. But a good friend of\nmine, who went for the first time last\nyear, gave a very bad critique of the\nJam. He spoke of a certain elitism that\nmakes itself known at the Harbin Jam;\ncertain cliques and groups and gatherings\nwhere he felt as if only those people\nwho were “in” were allowed to participate.\nThe rejection he suffered left\nsuch a bad impression on him that he\nsays he will never again go to the Harbin\nJam and that he would discourage\nanyone else from going. I tried to inspire\nsome other friends to come with\nme to the Jam, but they felt they had\nalready been excluded by Harbin’s\nprerequisite: “Participants must have a\nfirm grasp of Contact fundamentals.”\nThough I immensely value their participation\nat contact events, they felt they\ndidn’t have enough experience. My\nattraction to go was significantly diminished,\nbut now my agenda at the Jam\nincluded the responsibility of investigating\nthis claim of elitism.\nI was very surprised to perceive\nalmost no sign of elitism. In fact I was\nvery impressed by the overall format of\nthe Harbin Jam, the transparency of the\noligarchy, the numerous opportunities it\nallowed for each individual to speak\ntheir mind and heart and soul, and its\nresponsiveness to their dreams. It was\nonly on the very last day of the Jam,\nafter the tearful closing ceremony, after\nfilling out a rushed evaluation form,\nwhile packing up my tent in the rain at\ndusk, that a new friend pointed something\nout to me: the reason I didn’t\nexperience this inclusion/exclusion phenomena\nwas because I was somehow\nalready “in” from the moment I arrived.\nWhatever it is I am, it somehow has the\ncorrect age, attractiveness, skin color,\nsocioeconomic class, experience/skill\nlevel, and whatever other characteristics\nneeded for inclusion in the contact improvisation\ncommunity. She, however,\nwas not so lucky. This was her third\nHarbin Jam and she was only just beginning\nto taste the champagne and\ncaviar and community of inclusion,\nafter years of the slop and gruel of\nexclusion.\nShe, and most others attending the\nabove discussions, agreed that this “elitism”\nhad much less to do with any\ninherent political structures or policies\nof the various contact improvisation\njams, festivals, and workshops (though\nsome have worse reputations than others),\nand much more to do with the\nhabitual and all-too-often-unconsciously\nprejudicial behavior of the individuals\nwho attend them.\nI did have one uncomfortable experience,\nhowever, where not only was the\nelitism made apparent, but it was apparent\nthat I was expected to participate in\nit. The baths, pools, and facilities of\nthe Harbin Hot Springs community\nwere available for any and all the Harbin\njammers to enjoy as we wished\nThe Harbin Jam, however, and the\nbuilding it occupied, was off-limits to\nany guest or resident of the Harbin Hot\nSprings. While visiting the Hot Springs\nfacilities I encountered old and new\nfriends. Some of them were experienced\ncontact dancers who could not\nafford the cost of the Jam. Others had\nnot heard of Cl but were terribly interested\nto watch and learn about it. I had\nthe shameful duty to tell them they\nwere not welcome at the Jam.\nMy friends took it much better than\nI did. “That’s great!” they said. “That\nkind of closed, isolated context not only\nprovides a safe, secure environment for\npeople to explore their limitations, it\nalso acts like a pressure-cooker allowing\nyou to develop your ideas farther and\ndeeper than you could in a more open\ncontext!”\nYeah, whatever. I still would rather\nshare. Perhaps my shame will only\nserve to illustrate my own elitism. The\nelite group to which I subscribe is one\nthat values service to and sharing with\none’s community. It believes that the\nlimits of one’s community are imaginary\nexcept for their apparent existence\nwithin the most inflated of our human\nfaculties, the ego. And I invite each\nand every one of you to include yourselves\nin my group.\nThis week we celebrate the birthday\nof Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a man\nwho devoted his life to the fight for\nhuman equality. Dr. King’s dream of\nequal opportunity can hopefully inspire\nus to examine, confront, and change the\npatterns of discrimination we practice\ntoday within our own community. Our\narena is not nearly as volatile as that of\nKing’s struggle for equal rights in the\nDeep South in the 1950s and ’60s. But\nbecause it is not nearly as visible, it is\nmuch easier to deny. Though the contrast\nbetween the “included” and the\n“excluded” is not as sharp as that between\nlight skin and dark skin, the\nhomogeneity of our contact community\nis rather conspicuous. Considering the\ndiverse social and cultural milieu of the\ncities and towns and universities which\nhost our jams, classes, festivals and\nworkshops, should we not find it unsettling\nthat the vast majority of our members\nare attractive, educated, agile, mobile,\nemployed, housed, middle- to\nupper middle-class white folks, between\n30 and 45 years of age, with 10% body\nfat or less?\nI may do well in a desegregated\nsociety, but I can never know\nwhat my total capacity is until I\nlive in an integrated society. I\ncannot be free until I have had\nthe opportunity to fulfill my total\ncapacity untrammeled by any\nartificial hindrance.\nDr. King’s words are as much an\ninspiring code to live by as are the\nfundamental principals of contact improvisation:\nengage your partner, witness\nyour choices, take risks, build trust, stay\nin the moment, lean, commit, surrender.\nDr. King’s movement was all about\nreaching out to people and engaging\nthem, as if inviting them and including\nthem in his dance.\nIn between discussions on these hot\ntopics at Harbin, an idea was proposed\nto form a sort of “ethics committee”\nwhich would somehow be in charge of\nmonitoring and policing the choices and\nrules and policies created and followed\nwithin the contact community. I don’t\nbelieve this is a worthwhile solution\nbecause, after all, quis custodiet ipsos\ncustodes? Who will watch the watchers?\nPolitics, as a general rule, is a\ndirty business. And rather than forming\na committee, let’s just change our ways\nand lead by example.\nI’m very often inspired to take a\nlesson from contact dance and apply it\nto the broader spectrum of human intercourse.\nAt the Teacher’s Conference,\nCraig Schwartz was chosen to develop\nmaterial and present a class on the skill\nof “trusting one’s own innate physicality\nand impulses.” His material, which he\ncredited to Carol Swann, involved\n“watching the impulses that lead you\ninto movement. When you recognize an\nimpulse and where and how it will lead\ninto movement, choose not to follow\nthat impulse, instead choose to follow\nthe next impulse, or the next, or the\nnext one after that.”\nThe exercise provided an invaluable\nopportunity to observe the choices we\nmake and usually take for granted. Old\npatterns can be broken down, changed,\nand lifted out of their old ruts. Perhaps\nwe can learn to monitor the impulses\nwhich lead us to choose with whom we\nwill dance, or with whom we will not\ndance; whom we will include and why,\nand whom we will exclude and why.\nPerhaps then we can choose a different\npattern; a more inclusive one.\n\nSincerely,\nMark Koenig\nSanta Rosa, CA\n\n\nDear Mark,\nI read with interest your letter of\n1/15/95. It would take some time to\nrespond to it in detail so instead I will\ngive you something of an outline of\nwhat came up for me.\nINITIATION!\nWhen I was a Boy Scout in a small\nMidwestern town in the early ’60s, at\nsummer camp newcomers would be sent\nto the supply shack for such things as\ntwenty feet of shoreline or a sky hook\n(the latter to support the top of a teepee\nwhile it was being lashed together).\nA few years later I heard tales of\nfrat and sorority initiations though I\nstayed away from these organizations.\nI did go up through the ranks in the\nNavy. I made e-6 while having the\nexcellent duty of being on a reserve\ntraining ship in San Francisco Bay. I\nhad no choice but to submit to being\npicked up by all the senior petty officers\nand tossed into the bay. (In 1972\nthis was conducted with enough sensitivity\nthat I was able to give my eyeglasses\nto someone for safe-keeping as\nit was happening.)\nAs a self-educated electrician, and\nfor awhile in the late ’70s having a\ngirlfriend who was an apprentice in the\nelectrical union, I have heard more than\na few stories that include the theme, “I\nhad to endure this to get where I am\nand now I am doing it to you.”\nI really don’t believe that there is\nanything like this in the Bay Area contact\ncommunity.\nRather, I would say that the following,\nattributed to Buddhism, which I\nheard about eight years ago when I was\na beginning dancer, applies to the contact\ncommunity:\nIf you find someone beating\ntheir head against the wall,\ncompassion is not about putting\na pillow between their head and\nthe wall. Rather it is about\ncreating a safe place for them to\nexplore alternatives.\nI find it hard to imagine a better\ndescription of the Harbin Jams. I will\nconcede that the word jam may be a bit\nconfusing. Often, a jam means that it is\nopen to the public and available for\npeople to drop in on even if just to\nobserve. First of all, the Harbin Jams\nhave nothing to do with Harbin Hot\nSprings. We simply rent the space from\nthem. The jams are not listed in their\nquarterly magazine; they are private\nevents, limited to 50 to 60 dancers.\nWhile we have experimented with inviting\nguests, we’ve had to decide it’s not\npossible. I have participated in numerous\nmeetings at early jams where this\npolicy was exhaustively and painfully\narrived at. This policy is necessary and\nrespected. A few New Year’s Jams\nago, a meeting of teachers who were\norganizing the Contact festival needed\nto happen. Most of the teachers were at\nthe jam, so the meeting was at Harbin.\nA few teachers came up just for the\nmeeting. It was not at the conference\ncenter, nor did the “outsiders” come for\na dance, even though all of them were\ninsiders by your sense of the word.\nTo include Harbin residents and\nguests who are curious about the form,\nseveral of the jams have had participants\nvolunteer to teach a class in\nStonefront (or on the lawn in the summer)\nduring the course of the jam.\nWhy is it called a jam? Because we\nco-create it We do not go there for\ninstruction from one or two teachers\nwho make this happen as part of their\nlivelihood.\nThis is not to say that there is not a\nperceived “ideal/cream of the crop” of\nsize, strength, agility, social skill, dance\npassion, emotional openness and the\nlike. But there is no requirement about\nany of this to be an “experienced” contact\ndancer.\nIn his book, Seven Arrows, Hyeme-\nyohsts Storm relates the medicine wheel\nand the four directions to personal\ngrowth saying that while all people are\nbom with some of the skills they need\nto be fully realized, no one is born with\nthem all. He goes on to offer the vision\nof a culture that supports people to\ngrow spiritually and emotionally, while\nsharing in common material resources.\nOverall, while contact is athletic in\nnature, I have also enjoyed teaching it to\npeople who are older and less athletic as\na way of enhancing intimacy. It is also\none of many ways someone can explore\npersonal growth.

    "Abstract": "This article recounts the author's near-fatal car accident and subsequent recovery, highlighting the profound support and love received from the Contact Improvisation community. It explores how this experience shifted the author's perspective, fostering a deeper appreciation for life and the power of community connection. The author reflects on the significance of this collective support in the healing process and questions why such events are needed to solidify community bonds.",
    "Content": "“I’m feeling resistance in my belly\nand below my genitals. Concerns of\nenergy spurts. So I put on energy in\nmy sweat shirt, in my sweat pants. I\nthink I’m clear about the theory of\ndeveloping energy. I feel hesitancy\nabout moving forward. / think I need\nan extra pair of wings.”\n(These words, and all following\nitalicized words, were spoken\nseveral days after the accident,\nfrom body in altered state.)\nMoving forward in this life, I\nhave taken on an extra pair of wings.\nOn the morning of September 6th, I\nfell asleep driving and my car drifted\ninto an oncoming tractor trailer carrying\neighteen tons of steel. In the stark\nsilence that engulfed me following the\ncacophonic crash, crack, shatter, hiss\nof chaos, I began to conceive wings.\nIn the ambulance in which blood\ngushed from my forehead and I faintly\nclutched at consciousness, the wings\ngestated. During the early days when\nmy survival was questionable—when\nbody and soul grasped toward life\namidst surgery upon surgery—they\nbegan to open. I broke my leg, my\narm, my nose, the orbit above the eye,\nand some ribs; I lost my spleen and\nmy lung collapsed. One month later,\nas conscious awareness and memory\ngently returned to my being, the wings\nbegan to flutter...and flutter on they\nwill.\nEach time I previously submitted\narticles to Contact Quarterly, I aimed\nto further develop and bolster my\nteaching and performing career. Now,\nall has shifted. This near fatal accident\naltered my desires in this life. I\nno longer reach toward what I might\nbe or do; I feel joy that I just am.\nWith my ego-integrity flattened and\nmy appreciation for basic life overflowing,\nI can only speak of truth and\nLove. This article, then, articulates\nsome of the astounding things I’ve\nlearned and offers my gratitude to the\nContact community for its support.\n(OK, desperation. Let me wander...)\nAs one would naturally hope, the\nassistance of family and friends was\nprofoundly present as my body struggled\nfor survival. Taking over my\nroom and the waiting rooms on two\nfloors of the hospital, people engaged\nin meditation, authentic movement,\nexpressive arts, song, individual and\ngroup rituals and prayer. On the first\nday, calls went out to people within\nthe Contact community across the\ncountry and overseas; an hourly ritual\nof hope and prayer was initiated.\nLetters and notes of support poured in\nfrom the East Coast Contact Jam,\nEarthdance, fellow teachers, past students,\nand colleagues. One friend\nwrote: “Your recovery has been the\nmost striking manifestation of consciousness\nand community that I’ve\never seen. The whole community\naround you has been kind of in awe of\nitself and of your healing. Everybody\nwho has been in that room with you,\nyour family, your friends, everyone\nwho has called and written and sent\ngifts, has been part of a loving living\nthat brings tears to my eyes.”\nIn the last months, people expressed\nthat the communication stimulated\nbelief in the solidity, connectedness,\nand support of this Contact community.\nI feel deeply touched that so many\nwere willing to pour out their love to\nme; I recognize that it is there for\neach of us. I wonder why it takes\nsuch a near-tragic event to stimulate\nand solidify the ever-present community\nthat holds us, and bolster our trust\nin it. (The presence of the question is\nthe presence of ultimate fidelity.)\nThree months after my accident, I\naccompanied two friends to a Contact\nJam in New York City. Still low in\nenergy, and distant from any sense of\nmobility in my body, I expected to\ntalk with friends on the side and\nwatch. When I entered the room,\nhowever, I was touched by the heartfelt,\njoyful amazement of Contact\nfriends about my return; the wooden\nfloor and moving bodies drew my\ndancing spirit in. My body felt immediately\nsurging with energy, engaged,\nand flowing with movement. It became\nevident how fundamental dancing\nis to me as a way of getting to\na direct, immediate, experience of\ninteraction and energy.\nPrior to this rediscovery of movement\nI had difficulty accessing feelings\nof play and unbridled creativity.\nMoving again, my fantasy and imagination\nwere liberated. Drawing upon\nnonverbal and non-linear elements of\ninteraction opens infinite doors of\npossibility. Each dance I have asks\nme to be present in the ever surprising\nunfolding of communication.\nTo this date, I do not have full use\nof my leg and am sensitive in several\nareas. (I’m going to toss myself out to\nyou. Do you want to support me by\nmy left foot or my right foot? Have me\nin space to wander! Oh Jesus Christ.\nOh Barcelona.) This is the first time\nthat I have had any sort of injury or\ndifficulty with body movement Happily,\nI have learned that contacters are\nso committed to listening that I have\nnever felt fear that I would get hurt. I\nhave sensed that my partners were\naware and sensitive to the type of\nmovements my body could make;\nworking with these possibilities has\nbecome the basis for our dance. This\nseems like a gift for each of us, taking\nour impediments and saying, “this is\nme, and I can still have a full experience.”\nIn many ways, the physical trauma\nintroduced by this accident offered me\nintimacy with my physical body. One\nweek prior to the accident, I gave\nmyself a movement intention. Moving\nin the dance bam at Earthdance, I\nfound myself actively flying, rolling,\nand bolting through space. This deep\nphysicality was familiar to me; I often\nfound myself moving in this way\nwithout any warm-up. That time,\nhowever, I recognized a sense of\ndistance from deep, conscious sensuality;\nI could not feel the inner sensations\nof my body. I decided, from\nthat moment forward, I would give\nmyself ample time to enter my physicality\nand consciously enter body\nawareness before inhabiting a highly\nenergetic visceral state.\nThis intention was superbly satisfied\n(Tower, in my mania, in my ecstasy!)\nDeep subtle memories affirm that I\nwaged my own battle for cellular\nsurvival in the surgery room for days.\nI lay in my hospital bed for weeks\nperforming dream activities promoting\nrecuperative healing. I have done\nphysical therapy for several months,\nmost recently working toward realignment\nof various systems through\nBody-Mind Centering. Previously,\nbodywork felt pleasurable; with my\nnew awareness and sensitivity to body\nsensation, I experience a direct, visceral\nlevel of adjustment. I have more\nrichly than possibly intended passed\nthrough the entrance to internal awareness.\nI am blessed with new scars which\naccentuate and beautify my body. The\none on my inner forearm, ever-present\nfor my eyes, constantly reminds me of\nthe extraordinary journey I’ve been on.\nOne climbing from my belly button\ntoward the middle of my chest adds a\nfeeling of delicacy for fondling. The\nmost profound, and preferred, is over\ntwo feet long, beginning at the knee\nand extending up through the hip, a\nclear testament to the dramatic intensity\nof my Autumn accident. (Are you\nguys OK with the gravity ? My inconsistency\nis the new foam bed.) Unlike\nthe embarrassment of many others\nbearing such stark tales of their history,\nI find these scars beloved declarations\nof the life I have lived. We each\naccumulate, over time, specific details\nof our looks and distinct personalities.\nThe life we lead bears extraordinary\ngifts in times of need. (Hope.\nWe sending hope. Let my pauper\nenergy suck into the world.) Body\nawareness enables us to cellularly embrace\nand, if necessary, transform the\nchanges occurring in our bodies. The\nfitness which comes from movement\nprovides us with the energy and\nstrength to withstand, and rapidly\nrecuperate from, injury. Our engagement\nand curiosity supports us in\ntransforming seemingly unbearable\nevents into potential opportunities for\ngrowth. And, as I joyfully experienced,\nthe community to which we\nbelong offers support in the personal,\nmaterial, spiritual, and artistic realms.\n(So much miracle, I get better. /\nget birthed. I want, want...) to thank\neach generous soul who supported\nthe continuation of my spirit in this\nbody.",

    "Abstract": "Michael Linehan details the development and principles of his \"How to Fly\" workshop, which focuses on teaching dancers the skills of jumping, lifting, falling, and catching with safety and elegance. The workshop blends external physical techniques with internal mental focus, drawing inspiration from Aikido and acrobatic practices to expand dancers' expressive range and physical capabilities. He emphasizes safety, gradual progression, and the mindful application of these skills within performance.",
    "Content": "Steve Paxton studied Aikido\nwhich provided some of the core of\nContact Improvisation. I began dancing\nin 1974, doing Contact regularly in\n1975, in Vancouver, B.C. Contact led\nme to Aikido and provided some of the\ncore of my practice. Circling around.\nAt one point in the late seventies,\nI chose between these two. Aikido\nprovided more structure and regular\nclasses with high-level teachers—that\nsuited my style. I’ve had a total of\nfourteen years in Aikido. But I still do\nContact sometimes, and I think it’s a\nwonderful, profound form.\nI had been teaching Contact, mostly\nin the Vancouver area, up until 1979\nwhen I stopped teaching for several\nyears. In 1985, 1 got re-energized back\ninto teaching when I saw the Canadian\ndance group La-La-La Human Steps\nperform Human Sex, a very dynamic,\nathletic piece. I began to work with a\nfew dancers I knew, showing them how\nto jump, lift and catch, just because it\nwas fun.\nAbout a year later, I began to think\nabout teaching other people. I noticed\nthat almost nobody taught these skills to\ndancers, and when it was taught, everything\nwas usually very external. I gradually\ndeveloped an approach which I\nbegan to call “How to Fly.”\nHow to Fly includes a focus on both\nexternal and internal practices, physical\nand mental principles, and the use of\nboth muscle and energy. It’s really fun\nsometimes to do things from Aikido\nwith dancers which can seem to them\nreeeally strange and almost like magic.\nFrom a beginning of just playing around\nfor fun, I now go to Europe every summer\nto teach professional dancers.\nMost of the jumps I teach I developed\nin partnership with Peter Boulanger.\nI take them into my How to Fly classes\nand he takes them into acrobatic/circus\nwork with his partner, Nino Parent.\nSo what is ‘How to Fly’ anyway?\nIn dance, partner work offers an immense\nrange of expression. How to Fly\nopens these possibilities. The course is\nsuitable for all dancers because we\nstudy principles that can then be applied\nto any style of movement. I’ve also\nworked with theater people, clowns,\nacrobats and trapeze artists.\nWe learn how to jump, lift, fall,\ncatch and support with strength, safety\nand elegance. In a typical course we\nstudy:\n• the dynamic, athletic jumps which\nhave become popular in dance in\nrecent years\n• more graceful and balletic lifts\n• jumps and balances\n• groundwork: i.e., falling, rolling,\nsliding, pivoting\nThere are four parts to this course:\n• A foundation of mental and physical\nunderstanding is built using many\nsimple exercises.\n• Several fundamental jumps are repeated\nthroughout the course to extend\nbasic skills.\n• Conscious use of energy and mental\nfocus reinforce and enrich developing\nphysical abilities.\n• A wide variety of jumps, lifts and\nbalances are explored to expand\npossibilities and stimulate the\nimagination.\nIn teaching How to Fly, I always\nencourage participants to think of jumps\nas spice. I think they can really be\noverdone. I encourage people to have\nthe attitude that there might only be one\njump in a whole performance—but one\nshould be able to do it wonderfully.\n\nPRINCIPLES\nThe following are a few points from\nclass notes, which I hand out at the end\nof a session.\n\nSAFETY is the number one principle.\nChoreographers just somehow expect\ndancers to be able to jump and catch!!!\nDancers expect it of themselves!!!\nWhere did this idea come from? No\n‘technically’ trained dancer would\ndream of doing less than a gazillion\ncontractions, plids or whatever. I emphasize\nthat there is a body of techniques\nand skills here which need to be\npracticed regularly. Perhaps the primary\nthing that I ask everyone is to be\nresponsible for themselves and to work\nat their own pace. Abilities can be\nincreased little by little with virtually no\nrisk of injury, until the person is doing\nthings which are incredible.\nA few other basic points on safety\nare:\n• keep principles of safety every time,\nnot just at the beginning\n• look after yourselves and each other,\nsay what you need\n• full focus on each other while working\n• each time is fresh, unique\n• never play tricks\n• practice rolling and falling regularly\nATTENTION is the next important\npoint. Attention is an aspect of consciousness,\nand though western science\nhas little understanding of consciousness,\nthat does not hinder us from using\nit very effectively.\n‘Intention’ directs ‘Attention’... energy\nfollows attention...the body follows\nthe energy. We do many exercises such\nas being pushed slowly on the chest by\nour partner while directing the attention,\nfirst backwards, and then forwards. Of\ncourse, almost everyone feels a dramatic\ndifference.\nA key point is that this ability to\ndirect attention, and therefore energy, is\nnot just an on/off thing. The ability can\nbe strengthened and refined with practice.\nAttention can be spread widely or\nfocused like a laser; it can be directed\nsmoothly or explosively...then energy\nfollows. Effective use of attention gives\nfinesse, power and delicacy, and a quality\nof presence which can be so striking\nin a master performer.\nATTITUDE is very important Respect\nfor oneself, each other and the\npractice, a vibrant spirit, a positive\natmosphere. One key idea I would like\nto mention is my disagreement with the\nold saying, “Practice Makes Perfect”\nThis statement has done great disservice\nto those who believe it Instead, I teach\nmy students that “Perfect Practice\nMakes Perfect.” I don’t mean literally\nthat we must be perfect, but that we\nneed to strive for complete sincerity and\nfocus every time. Imagine always training\nwith an alert and curious mind, fully\nengaged. Sure, sometimes we don’t feel\nso sharp. But on those days too, we can\ndecide to work with an interested attitude\nof “What’s happening here? What\ncan I discover today?” The most familiar\ntechniques will become fresh, because,\nin fact, they are always different.\nBe prepared to let go of what you know\nfor what you can learn. Fill each moment\nwith your desire to study. Ten\nrepetitions like this will reward us much\nmore than one thousand done in “everyday\nmind.” We will progress by leaps\nand bounds (whatever the discipline),\nand the experience of the process will\nbe so much richer. Our mental and\nemotional states become embodied as\ncertainly as do our developing physical\nskills.\n\nCENTER. How I teach comes mainly\nfrom Aikido, but the feeling is the same\nas we experience in the effortless jumps\nand catches of Contact. In How to Fly\nwe also work from the center, in catching\nand in jumping. Connecting center\nto center gives an increased ability to\nfeel, mold, play. We use the skeleton to\nsupport the weight, the muscles to\nguide: no straining, not too much energy,\nbut rather just the right amount used\nprecisely, cleanly, with relaxation. As\nin Contact, sensory and motor skills are\nboth micro and macro. All qualities of\nenergy are useful (flowing or solid,\ndelicate or explosive, etc.) I want people\nto develop the ability to choose, the\nability to move freely between many\ndifferent intensities and kinds of energy.\nAnd breath is central. It ties together\nour mind, body and energies.\nPHYSICAl SKILLS\nW* xwdt every v> here from melted into\nthe floor to ter feet in the ait. We\nhoc \\ as v.t Coe.'.ACt. w.th becomutg\n\\e;\\ vvmtoruh'.e w-.tfe the floor, and\nwith moving into and out of the floor.\nThis remains the foundation. I ask\npeople to continue working with this\nafterwards, for safety, for options, for\ntheir own feeling of security and the\nrichness this comfort can bring to their\ndance. We work with small weighttaking\nexercises, making sure people can\nsupport before moving into the first\nsmall jumps. The specific exercises\ncome from Contact, Aikido, acrobatics\nand my own invention.\nAs we proceed into jumping, I draw\nvery much from Aikido, adapting its\nnormal (sagittal) plane of activity to\ndifferent orientations. The stability and\nstrength to absorb high impact, and to\nlift above the head, come from Aikido\nways of working with center. Always\nI emphasize attention, energy, consciousness,\nso the exercise is never just\nan outward physical endeavor. We\nstrive for congruence, everything working\ntogether. I want students to appreciate\nthat when we begin to work effectively\nwith these inner aspects, the outer\nbecomes immensely easier.\nLet me give you an idea of a few\n’urv.v's from How to Fly [see phxas]:\nRoll-Over: spinning horizontally while\ntravelling through the air; half turn, 1\nfull turn, 2 full turns.\nOne-Arm: one arm high angel, jumper\non their side.\nHelicopter: one arm high angel, jumper\non their belly.\nRun-Away: jumper runs away from\ncatcher (lots of space between them)\nand jumps to a horizontal layout position\non their back about five feet off the\nfloor as catcher runs full speed, sliding\nin on knees and catching partner close\nto floor.\nAs the class proceeds, jumps like\nthese are done from further and further\naway, with more and more energy.\nWithout trying to describe details,\nmaybe a few more names of jumps will\nevoke images: roll-under jump; delayed\nroll and dropping catches; corkscrew;\nhip, like wave; swan dive; dive through\nring; upside-down cross, no hands; rock\nand roll to no hands; swan to back of\nneck.\nIn contrast to the big ‘adrenaline’\njumps listed above, some of the most\nfascinating and paradoxically difficult\nwork is with small, delicate jumps or\nrides. The particular focus and finesse\nrequired brings a very different and\nsatisfying feeling. These smaller movements\nare quite familiar to Contacters.\nWhen taken out of the context of Contact\nImprovisation, they can be difficult\nto learn, but very rewarding for people\nwho can grasp the quality.\nI think that’s a big part of How to\nFly. Many times I’ve watched the\nenergy and presence of beautiful dancers\ngo flat as soon as they had to jump.\nI want to help dancers integrate jumping\nand catching into their dance; bring\ntheir jumping skills up to the standard\nof the rest of their performance; and do\nit with strength, safety and elegance.\nWhat makes each teacher’s work\nunique is in the elements of experience\nthey choose to include in their recipe, in\nthe nuances of presentation, and in the\ndecisions they make in the flow of a\nclass. I hope in this sketch, I’ve given\nsome idea of my work; of how my\nContact seed has flowered.",

    "Abstract": "This article discusses the challenges and adaptations required when teaching the Alexander Technique in Japan. It highlights cultural differences, particularly regarding touch and social interactions like bowing, and how these impact the learning and teaching process. The author emphasizes the importance of addressing these cultural nuances to effectively facilitate the development of sensitive touch and awareness in Japanese students.",
    "Content": "Students of the Alexander Technique\nare drawn to that work for a\nvariety of reasons ranging from chronic\npain to problems in performing\ndaily tasks. For others, Alexander\nwork is about communication skills\nand thinking clearly; in other words,\nthey desire that hard-to-define-but-we-\nknow-it-when-we-see-it quality called\npresence. The Alexander Technique\nencompasses all of the above because,\nin essence, it deals with how we respond\npsychophysically to stimuli.\nWe are creatures of habit, but often\nhabits serve to limit choices and flexibility.\nThrough studying the Alexander\nTechnique, new doors open. Put\nsimply, the role of an Alexander teacher\nis to provide opportunities for\nchange.\nIn order to teach the Alexander\nTechnique, one must be well on the\nway to understanding the relationship\nbetween thinking and activity. In\naddition, there are certain skills to be\nlearned with regard to seeing and\ntouching. The teacher needs to see\noverall patterns of muscular use as\nwell as to detect subtle, immeasurable\nmovements. Alexander teachers use\ntheir hands to guide students’ awareness\nand movement in a way that is\ngentle yet powerful. Learning to touch\nin this specific way is complicated\nenough in Western cultures; in Japan,\nthe challenges are myriad.\nAs the director of KAPPA,* the\nfirst Alexander teacher training program\nin Japan, I have had to take into\naccount certain cultural differences in\norder for my teaching to be effective.\nLanguage is certainly a major issue,\nbut my Japanese is improving slowly,\nand several of the trainees are skilled\ntranslators and share the responsibility\nof translating during class. Another\nfactor which has both a positive and\nnegative side stems from the rigorous\neducational system in Japan. The\ntrainees devote their undivided attention\nto whatever is presented and take\ntheir study seriously. For most teachers\nin any field, such discipline would\nbe welcome, but the danger within an\nAlexander class is that students will\npush themselves beyond the point of\nconstructive learning. To prevent\nglassy-eyed burnout, we take breaks:\ntea breaks, moving breaks, hanging\nout breaks. All a part of learning and\ndigesting new information.\nPerhaps the biggest challenge for\nthose of any nationality learning to\nteach the Alexander Technique lies in\ndeveloping an informed, accurate and\nsensitive touch. A teacher’s hands\ndirect a student’s movement and flow\nof energy. These skills take time,\npractice and clarity of intention, not to\nmention a certain degree of intuition.\nIn the beginning, just learning to touch\nanother person with a clear intention\ncan seem mystifying. At the moment\nof contact, one’s awareness must\ninclude one’s own psychophysical\ncoordination as well as visual, tactile\nand auditory information from the\nstudent. In terms of awareness, the\ncontact begins well before the instant\nof physical touch.\nAll of the skills and qualities mentioned\nabove can be taught, but what\nhappens in a culture in which the act\nof touching another person in public is\nnot only unfamiliar but intimidating?\nIn America, we shake hands, hug or\ngive high fives. In Europe, kissing\nboth cheeks is a standard greeting\nregardless of gender. In Japan, they\nbow. The nature of the relationship\nbetween two people determines the\ndepth and duration of the bow, and the\naction is repeated often within the\ncourse of even a brief interaction. In\nbowing, the gaze is lowered and\nawareness of self diminishes. This\naction contradicts Alexander principles.\nIn the training course, students\nare challenged to feel comfortable\nwith themselves at their true height\nwhile actually seeing another person.\nIn learning to inhibit the downward\npull associated with bowing and putting\noneself beneath others. KAPPA\ntrainees have had to confront the psychological\nand emotional aspects of\nthis ingrained cultural habit.\nBridging the gap between self and\nother goes well beyond making physical\ncontact, into territory both tangible\nand intangible. In general, experience\nenhances theory, so as an adjunct to\nlearning “Alexander touch,” I introduced\nthe Japanese trainees to the\nculture of Contact Improvisation.\nAfter working intensively for four\nevenings during the week, our Saturday\nclass was a time for assimilating\nand for looking into related work such\nas developmental movement, Barten-\nieff Fundamentals and Contact Improvisation.\nEarly classes included leading\nand following exercises and partnering\nwith finger to finger contact.\nThese Contact experiences greatly\ninform Alexander teaching skills such\nas timing and flexibility. More importantly,\nthe students lost their apprehension\nabout initiating touch with a\npartner. The Contact work influenced\nnot only the quality of touch but gave\nthe students more confidence and ease\nin the Alexander partner work.\nAs the first year of the training\ncourse progressed, the Saturday classes\ntook on a unique character. Some\nof the discipline of the weekday classes\nfell away, and students felt free to\nroll on the tatami floor or, if need be,\nto drift into sleep for a few moments.\n(The general level of stress and exhaustion\nin Japan goes beyond anything\nI’ve witnessed in the States, but\nsheer will drives the Japanese beyond\nthe limits of comfort. I celebrate\nwhen my students allow themselves to\ncollapse!) Feeling as if any movement\nstructure put forth would be attempted\nin good faith, I introduced weight\nsharing and weight bearing. Granted,\nAlexander teachers do not make full\nbody contact or do any heavy lifting,\nbut to myself I justified teaching these\nactivities as means of learning spatial\nawareness and kinesthetic sensitivity.\nCertainly I did not need to justify\nmy methods to the students because\nthey were too busy having fun. Witnessing\nYuzuru, aged 61, steamrolling\nacross his partner’s back with sheer\ndelight quickly erased any doubts as to\nthe value of this work. Part of what\nan Alexander teacher does is put the\nstudents at ease so that constructive\nthinking and learning can take place.\nIf the teacher is uncomfortable with\nhis or her own movement, that discomfort\nwill be conveyed to the student.\nSpatial awareness is also necessary\nso that the teacher can recognize\nand respect the student’s personal\nboundaries. Establishing a comfortable\ndistance in which to work demands\nunderstanding of nonverbal\ncues and the ability to move closer or\nfarther away without losing “the direction”\nin one’s hands. Such subtle,\ninterpersonal skills can only be learned\nexperientially.\nAs unorthodox as it may seem,\nincluding a bit of Contact Improvisation\nin Alexander teacher training cuts\nthrough a lot of awkward fumbling.\nSensing yourself as well as your partner\nin a Contact duet can translate to\nknowing where you are in relation to\nyour student in an Alexander lesson.\nKinesthetic “listening” cultivated\nthrough following a point of contact\napplies directly to what Alexander\nteachers call “giving direction” through\ntouch.\nIn Japan, outside of the training\ncourse, I attend as many performances\nof both traditional and contemporary\ndance and theater as possible. From\nwhat I’ve seen of “modem dance” in\nJapan, physical contact is relatively\nrare. One company, called Monochrome\nCircus, includes some leaning\nand falling in pairs, and several Butoh\ngroups incorporate touching, but none\nof this partnering could be called Contact\nImprovisation. There might be\nsome Contact in Tokyo, but as far as I\nknow, the trainees in the Kyoto Alexander\nProgram are the first generation\nof Japanese Contacters!",

    "Abstract": "This article documents a performance by Richard Bull and Cynthia Novack at an academic conference, where they presented their ideas on \"blurring genres\" through movement and spoken word. The piece explores the intersection of performance and academic discourse, challenging traditional presentation formats by embodying their ideas rather than simply stating them. The text captures the essence of their improvised duet, inviting the reader to imagine the movement and interpret its meaning.",
    "Content": "“Blurring Genresa conference on “alternative forms of critical practice,” was held\nat the University of Alberta, Canada, in April, 1989. Choreographer Richard Bull was a\npanelist, but instead of using the panel’s podium, he rose from his seat, joined by his\nassociate, Cynthia Novack, and began to move as he spoke. This article, while it does not\ntranscribe the text of the event, is based on it, further blurring the genre by moving it to\nthe printed page. [R.B.]\n“Was she ready to begin when he leaned toward her?” he asked as he leaned\ntoward her. They were in the front row of the conference room, and he spoke quietly;\nonly those very near her (in the room) overheard him.\n“She was ready to begin,” she answered quietly, “and rose slowly from her seat,\nmoving past the podium.” She rose, slowly, quietly, and walked toward the podium.\nSome members of the audience noticed the two of them (watching, listening). Perhaps a\npanelist’s presentation was getting organized? This was, perhaps, a program event?\nAs she rose from her chair and moved (forward, toward her right) she looked at\nhim over her left shoulder, gesturing toward him. “As she moved away from him, what\nwere his thoughts?” she said.\nHe moved with her, opposite her in the open space. “He was surprised...and\npleased...to see how she had dressed for the meeting,” he said, leaving it to the reader\nto imagine her costume and invent her body. “He thought they were a duet of panelists.\nThey were, by definition, of the genre panelist. He was staring at her,” he said, staring\nat her.\nHe began turning a tight circle of tiny steps around himself, looking anxiously at\nher. He stopped. “What was the meaning of the term blurring genres to her?” he\nasked, half expecting the term to be defined later (elsewhere) in the published\nproceedings.\nThere was a moment of silence, of stillness, of nothing happening, of audience\nanticipation. She was waiting for an answer to occur, he was waiting for her to answer.\nSuddenly he resumed his circling in place (sauntering), and she joined him, turning tight\ncircles about herself (ambling), in phase with him—the two of them facing the front of\nthe room together, then the side, the back, the other side, the front, and so on, rounding\nthe comers in perfect synchrony. Together they formed a (slowly pirouetting) pair of\nperipatetic panelists.\nShe paused. He stopped turning. She began walking slowly toward the front of\nthe room. He headed toward the back comer, waiting for her to answer, but she was\nabsorbed in looking up at the ceiling of the room as she moved forward, a deceptively\ndifficult mind-body coordination, given her unfamiliarity. Then, abruptly, she broadened\nher stride, taking giant steps across the front of the room. These last two descriptive,\npedestrian paragraphs, without question or answer, were for the reader, who smiled,\nglanced over them again, and then continued (sitting, reading).\n“To blur the genre, one must see it for what it is not” (she took a deep breath),\n“which means seeing it clearly and distinctly” (a series of small returning steps and a\nquick turn). “At the moment, we are both panelists and performers” (a sudden fall to\nthe floor), “creating a new genre” (stretch out on the floor, relax, close the eyes, seem to\ndoze off).\nHe watched, listening carefully, then struck out into the space. He, too, took big\nsteps, small steps, a quick turn, and then (surprise) a prodigious feet-first leap against\nthe wall, flipping himself over and (thud) landing on his hands near the table of offset\nannouncements and excerpted articles.\nShe opened her eyes, dimmed by the darkness. Except for that movement\n(eyelids) she was quite still. She knew she had missed (seeing) something, but she had\n(listening) heard it, every step of it, and knew enough to wait for his next move. He\ntook it, giving it to her.\n“What was the significance” (drop out of the handstand) “of the lean and\nmuscular bibliography” (come into a heavy squatting crouch, arms dangling absently,\nknuckles grazing the floor), “taken in the context of the conference itself?” (stand up,\nalmost casually, move off to the side). He glared at her, rocking back and forth, toe to\nheel to toe again, and again to heel, continuing the (choreographic) phrase as she\nresponded to him.\n“The bibliography contained only two books, both of them by James Joyce.” She\nclarified, crossing the room to stand close to him, sending the reader to first one1, then\nanother2 footnote at the bottom of the page. A moment later she recrossed the room to\nstand opposite him (rock and roll).\n“His crouching, his sudden standing, his moving off to one side, his rocking and\nrolling: these movements were anticipated in that bibliography.” Her eyes narrowed; the\nroom blurred. As if on cue, the audience (sitting, watching, listening, not moving at all)\nstirred restlessly.\nThey stood together, not moving; listening, watching (without moving). They\nsaid nothing (looking, thinking, blurring; they could feel someone reading them). Then,\nspontaneously, without planning it, they sat down together, casually, easily, without\nfootnotes, without chairs (on the floor together, sitting).\n“Had she noticed,” he said, “the taking off of the shoes and socks?” As he\nspoke, he acted (taking them off), and so did she, except for the speaking, which he did\nwithout her (not speaking).\n“Two, one from each—that is, one person, one foot, one shoe, one bare\nfoot—off! Or, otherwise described, two taken together; four feet, two bare, two shod,\none on each, a total of eight, if shoe and sock are not taken as one but as two, one each\nfor each foot.” He thought of the shoes and socks as sucking stones, and resolved to\nreread the pebble passage before expanding the bibliography.3\nShe stuffed a sock into her shoe and tossed it to the side of the room. “Of\ncourse,” she added as she rose to one (bare) foot, “the absence of the same makes\nsixteen, as the thoughtful reader will surely see.” He had finished (talking and taking\noff one shoe and one sock) and this had been her answer. He stood up in his shoe,\nbeside her. “Of course?” he asked (rhetorically standing).\nAnd then, quietly, and very slowly (emphasized and quietly italicized for the\nreader), they backed away from the audience. Nothing was said, except to say that they\nbacked further away; still nothing was said, and a hush upon everything in the room:\npanelists, performers, audience, bystanders, onlookers, passers-by. But not the room\nitself, a subdued but noisy genre whose walls—electrical, mechanical, providential—\nwere beyond the control of the conference (backing up slowly, quietly).\nReaching the back of the room (simultaneously, side by side) they reversed\ndirection and began to walk forward slowly, alternating questions, responses, and feet in\na geometry of studied, allusive indifference.\n“What was the feel of the floor beneath her feet?” he asked (step, steptogether;\nstep, steptogether: a processional).\n“First warm,” she said, “then cool; dry and caky, then wet; first like a corrugated\ncardboard bookcover, then very much like the shallow shore of a small island (more of\nthe stylized, processional progress, an approach to the chairs in the front row).” She\npaused pomographically, stretching her sensuous panelist’s body voluptuously (to shock\nthe reader and blur the genre once again) then asked: “And the feel of his floor?”\n“He felt its roundness (the planet); he felt it firm (the building containing the\nroom); he sensed it both pushing and pulling at him (the force called gravity).” He felt\nguided by all these things. And, yet, he hesitated, hovering over his seat, looking back\nat her. “And yet—why did he hesitate, hovering over his seat, looking back at her?”\n“For the same reason that she hesitated,” she reassured him. ‘They knew that\nthey were being watched. They were of the same genre. They stood in evidence.” She\nhesitated a moment, stepping forward (standing beside him). “Did he, too, sense that\ntheir presence as performance panelists was blurring, fading, perhaps even ending?” she\nasked.\nThis last question went unanswered as they sat down. They were preoccupied\n(sitting down), acknowledging the polite applause (heads nodding). There was a\nscheduled break in the proceedings, and the room began to reverberate with personal,\nprivate proceedings, most of them alliterative (cups of coffee, conversations, colloquies,\nconquests, choreographies), foreshadowing further footnotes, alternative forms.",

    "Abstract": "This article reflects on the importance of art in society, especially during times of political and social change. It argues that art fosters creativity, connects individuals to deeper truths, and provides a vital spiritual dimension in a materialistic world. The author emphasizes art's role in encouraging thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and awareness.",
    "Content": "Dear Eds, I was recently asked to give a talk\non a panel at the Arts NW booking conference\nin Boise, Idaho. When I sat\ndown to write it (it was to be about\n“Arts and the Community’’), what came\nout was a response to what’s happening\nnow—politically.\nThis is not about alternative dance\nor alternative art. It’s just about ART\nin our society and why it is so very\nimportant—now more than ever. We\nare being made to feel unnecessary and\nself-indulgent, so this is to help tell\nourselves and others how noble our\nprofession is.\n“Art and Society”\nJanuary 1995\nWith the recent sudden change in\nthe political climate in this country, I\npersonally have had to once again immerse\nmyself in the deep reasons for\nbeing involved in the arts, in order to\nhave the strength and courage to continue\nin what I believe to be one of the\nnoble pursuits of humankind. There is\nin the current political climate an increasingly\nfashionable atmosphere of\nconformity to preset slogans, a fear of\ndiversity and creativity, and perhaps\nmost disturbing—an overriding materialism\nthat is so pervasive we often cease\nto even notice it.\nNOW more than ever is a time when\nart and artists are important for our\nculture and for our souls. Just when we\nmight feel like dinosaurs—some obsolete\nspecies left over from the sixties—\nwe need to recognize that we are more\nimportant than ever, and to renew our\nenergies. Art at its best can lift us\nabove our pettinesses and allow us to\nbreathe the air of a state of awareness in\nwhich our minds, hearts, bodies and\nspirits can be integrated; and our deeper\nconnections with each other, with all\nliving things, and with our planet, can\nbe felt.\nArt means involvement in creative\nprocess—an integration of rational intelligence\nand intuition—with a deep reverence\nfor TRUTH, and the timeless\nvalue that integration of beauty and\ntruth can bring us. Whether it is a\ndance, a play, a painting, a poem or\nmusic, it is an experience of the creative\nenergy that is within us all. By experiencing\nthis ourselves, and by helping\ncommunicate this to others, we allow\neveryone involved to get in touch with\ntheir creative energy—whether it involves\ncreating a work of art, marketing\nart, raising a child, running a business,\nhealing illness, being a congressional\nrepresentative—anything.\nIn the absence of pervasive spiritual\ninvolvements in our society, art is the\nclosest thing we have to help us go\ndeeper into ourselves—beyond our egos\nand our material concerns. I think we\nall know how very important this is.\nThis is not just a matter of relaxation\nand entertainment—although it can be\nrelaxing and entertaining. Art appeals\nto the best that is within every human\nbeing—and helps that bit of best grow\nbigger.\nI have been an artist for twenty\nyears and have performed and taught all\nover the world. It is because of these\nawarenesses that I continue in a\nfield—dance—in which there is little\npossibility of living much beyond poverty\nlevel even when wildly successful.\nIf the performances I help create give\nsome audience members energy and\nexcitement about their own creativity\nand the possibilities in their own lives,\nthen I feel I am doing something very\nimportant.\nIf artists don’t underestimate the\nintelligence of the audience—but always\nassume that everyone out there is\nawake, intelligent, open-minded, creative,\nexcited about life and aware of its\ndepth and mystery—and if the artwork\nis open enough in its possibilities for\ninterpretation, each perceiver can individually\nrespond, free-associate or be\notherwise stimulated, while simultaneously\nexperiencing some common\nthrust of meaning with the rest of the\naudience. If the artwork does not blast\nthe audience with a theme that is impossible\nto misunderstand, but gives\nthem something with a bit of the multifacetedness\nand elusiveness of real life,\nthen the experience will sharpen the\ncreative and perceptual powers of the\nviewer. We will be encouraging\nthoughtfulness, sensitivity, and a deep\nawareness of one’s own intuitions,\nrather than helping create a nation of\ncouch potatoes whose most intense\nemotions lean toward anger and frustration,\nand who are ready to follow anyone\nwho feeds them a handy slogan.\nOn the one hand, we have the possibility\nof a society of enlightened individuals\nwith a deep feeling of connection\nand harmony, and a respect for\ndiversity. On the other hand, we have\nthe possibility of fascism. It is always\nlurking there.\nIf politicians are going to have any\nchance of changing the world by appealing\nto the best in people, we need\nto develop a way of life in which people\nare encouraged to develop the best\nin themselves. This has been the role\nof art for centuries. This means judging\nhow we are doing not by how much\nfood is on our own individual plate and\nmoney in our individual pocket, but by\nhow enlightened we are as individuals\nand how connected we are to each other\nand to the creative forces in our universe.",
