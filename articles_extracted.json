I want to drum up this spirit. In\nteaching Contact I feel two things:\n1.

I've come here to Missoula and I feel\nthat the form \"Contact\" is pretty much\ncom man knowledge or thought to be by\nalot of people and there are lots of ex-\npectations to what it is - \"Get out the\nmats - do a round robin\"\nSo I think in order to teach the spirit of con-\ntact I cannot teach Contact.\nI want to create a situation in which free play\n- FREE PLAY - can happen -\nWhere a certain concentration is going - with\na certain practice - and nothing happens until something is happening\nI want to create a situation where\n1 nothing happens (an exhausted state)\nAND\n2 (when you dont know whats gonna happen is happening)\nSO TEACH A CLASS IN WHICH YOU REACH A STATE WHERE NOTHING IS HAPPENING BUT POS-\nSIBILITIES ARE OPEN - THATS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO ------SURPRISES - -VOICE WORK ---\nSHOUT A WORD TO EACH OTHER---- GO OUT AND TAKE A WALK AROUND THE ROOM-------",

    "Text": "Images. Spent time with Mary Fulkerson, teaching and taking classes. Several of our number\n[contacters] have studied with Mary, and she has spent time in Contact, though she prefers\nher own work as a basis from which to teach. However, the continuing juxtaposition of her\nAnatomical Release work and Contact has provoked a headful of thought; her students in Eng-\nland and those from Rochester, N.Y. take to Contact with remarkable ease compared to other\ngroups in the U.S.\nThis ease of assimilation is of interest. While the students are lying down, crawling, walking or\nrunning, Mary Fulkerson speaks ritually, encouraging greater sensitivity to alignment and efficient\npatterns in the body. The manner of presentation tends to by-pass the though~ of the listener.\nThe listener is preoccupied with moving or relaxing at the time, and the ritualization has a lulling\neffect, soothing in tone and timing. The images she provides are simplified anatomical 'cartoons'\nof functioning anatomy as opposed to intellectual or visual anatomy. These images describe .sen-\nsations - their location in the body and possible directions in which they might move.\nThe students then assimilate material directly from their own sensations, culled from releasing\nunnecessary tension, work, strain.\nMary Fulkerson finds a rare balance of authority and humility which gives fundamental weight\nto her voice without usurping the motivation of the student and avoiding their rebellion or\nfascination. Nor does her voice question the integrity of the sensations unique to each student.\nTheir confidence in the process gathers momentum with the growth of awareness of the functional\nanatomy, and soon, non-anatomical images can be simply physicalized. Earlier in the process\nhowever, before these channels become clear, an illogical image would more likely provoke bewild-\nerment, scorn, or intellectual interest, than movement.\nThe parallel is with the Contact 'stand': The mind of the listener is encouraged to become a\nreceiving instrument. Fulkerson's images further provide guidance to sensations which improve\nfunction. The stand in Contact isused to remove the habitual masking of the forces-that-be by\nrelaxing the listener into states of mind where time, gravity, mass and inertia are apparent, where\nbalance is seen as subtle movement, and social expectations in partnering can be dropped; it is\npossible to talk directly to the body~ and for the listener to listen directly with the body. Each\nperson can hone and direct real physical sensations into their own most direct & efficient dance.\nAs Mary Fulkerson is currently presenting her work at Dartingtim College (Devon, England) it\nis used as a first step providing the student with a map into private anatomical sensations and\nimprovements. Great care has been given to the anatomical propriety of the images, because\nin this work, the idea each person's mind holds of their body is seen as crucial to the awareness\neach develops.\nBeyond Mary Fulkerson's work there is a question for the student at Dartington. What to do\nwith the vocabulary they have sensed and the improvements they find in their use of the body?\nMany possibilities exist, and one path, that of Contact, seems quite compatible; moving from\nthe interior of one's functioning anatomy, to functioning with another. I hope in the coming\nyears more of us have an opportunity to sample this connection.",

    "Text": "In response to Daniel Lepkoff's letter last issue (Number Four/Spring 76), a question:\nHow removed from the defined Contact classes and concepts should one be and continue to call\nthe material Contact Improvisation? There are two sectors this question affects: the contactor5,\nand the public; that is, students, prospective students, or views of contact - the public image as\nit were, by which to some degree Contact Improvisation is defined.\nContact is not a finished thing. Changes in its methodology and its result are expected.\nHowever, the definition it has achieved has been a consistent one, giving a useful continuity to those\nnew performers who wish to communicate, especially on paper, what they are doing in concerts\nand classes. For the students of Contact (of whom there have been many hundreds at this writing)\nit seems only fair to either follow procedures designed to aid them in dancing with community of\ncontactors at large, or to indicate in titles and descriptions of classes (as Mangrove has done) the\nbridge between Contact Improvisation and new attitudes stemming from Contact, that are actually\nquite different in practice. The delicacy comes here: How wide is the definition of Contact to be,\nand is Contact well used by this extrapolation? An extreme position relative to the established core\nof Contact Improvisation should probably be given another name or reserved for advanced contactors\nto whom the references would be clear.\nThis is a century of extrapolation. It is not coincidental that industrial revolution, the\nmodern arts, the increased pace of communication and travel have all occurred this past 100 years.\nChange of attitude, environment, ideas, reality, happen far more easily now and the problem is\nthis, change is cheap. Definition has become difficult to establish or to maintain.\nThe artist has a duty/right to manipulate the techniques which contribute to their art.\nThere are however, responsibilities to these techniques to keep them clear of confusion. For those\ndancers already familiar with Contact techniques, it may be that outside the Contact framework more\nimprovisational adventure may be found. Should it, however, be called Contact? The dilution or the\nrefinement of that central experience depends on the consideration_ we give its presentation.",

    "Text": "It is Contact Improvisation's 25th anniversary this year, an occasion to celebrate and\nreflect on Contact Improvisation as a dance form and its growth from a week of performances at\nthe John Weber Gallery in NYC in June of 1972 initiated by Steve Paxton with a group of young\ndancers, to a movement form practiced by thousands of people all over the world. It has been a\nremarkable evolution, much of it chronicled in the pages of Contact Quarterly.\nIn 1975, a few years into the work, we began hearing of physical injuries resulting from\npeople doing Contact from having seen it in performance, without an introduction to the subtle ·\nsensing work that underlies the more vigorous physical activity. How to keep the work safe? we\nwondered. Steve, and the small group continuing to practice and show the work with him, con-\nsidered trademarking the name and certifying or authorizing teachers. Preliminary papers were\ndrawn up but were never signed. The prospect of policing Contact was not appealing. More\ninteresting was the idea of creating a vehicle for communication, a newsletter, in which to report\nactivity and current thinking within the work, in this way keeping the work open, and inviting\nourselves and others further into the dialogue.\nThis seems to have been a crucial decision, one leading to the considerable expansion of\nthe work and its enrichment by many individuals over the years.\nFor the First European Contact Teachers Conference, in Holland in 1985, Margot Rijven,\nKaren Nelson, and I manufactured a quick, xeroxed compendium of writings on Contact Improv-\nisation from all the issues of Contact Quarterly dance journal that we could get our hands on in\nAmsterdam, including several of the early issues. It was a handy, fascinating volume which we\nreprinted twice for the Contact Teachers Conferences at the Breitenbush Hot Springs Contact Jams\nin Oregon in 1986 and 1987. We sold the leftover copies through CQ and that was the end of it.\nIn honor of Contact's silver jubilee, and because many of our early issues are now out of\nprint, CQ has produced this new and updated, limited edition CI Sourcebook. In it you'll find\nthe majority of writings on Contact Improvisation that have appeared in CQ from its inception\nas Contact Newsletter in 1975 through Volume 17, 1992. CQ issues from 1993 to the present,\ncontaining increasing amounts of Contact dialogue, are available through CQ as back issues.\nThe making of the CQ/CI Sourcebook was a big job, bigger than any of us expected.\nEach page has been carefully prepared by Harriett Jastremsky and Mette Gustavsen, photocopied\ndirectly from the original magazine pages with minor alterations, adding volume and year\ncitations at the bottom of each page to orient you. They handled all aspects of the increasingly\ncomplex production with grace, curiosity, creativity and good humor.\nSome explanation about the recurring section headings in the book: \"Definitions\" were a\nregular feature in the first years of CQ. We included a different definition of Contact in every issue\nalong with a photo, in this way hoping to record the variety of styles used for presenting/describ-\ning this new movement form as it developed; many are included here. As CQ grew, several\n\"departments\" were created in the magazine to support the increasing exchange amongst Contact\npractitioners. \"Round Up: CI in perspective\" ran from 1976 to 1981 and included a variety of\nreviews and views of the work. In 1984 we instituted \"Still Moving: Contact shoptalk and\ndialogue,\" to encourage in-depth discussions of the working process that went beyond the newsy\nreports in the Contact Newsletter section of the magazine. This column has continued to grow\nin substance and in size over the years.\nThe CQ/C/ Sourcebook contains lively and personal evidence of the growth of Contact\nImprovisation as a duet movement form, the community that grew up around it, and the concur-\nrent evolution of the magazine. Evidence of people taking initiative to make events happen and\nattempting, in many forms, to articulate their findings. Reading through these years of CQ writ-\nings is like going on an archeological dig, into the heart and mind of the work as it lives in the\npeople who do it. It is satisfying to have these pages together in a single volume. The spirit of\ndiscovery and exchange is strong; the reflection, dimensional.\nWe hope you find the Sourcebook a useful and enjoyable addition to your library. Your\nresponses, as well as your own Contact writings, are always welcome at CQ's mailbox. Please\ndon't hesitate to be in touch.",

    "Text": "ELIZABETI-1: At the very beginning of a Contact Improvisation workshop,\nteachers often talk about the 'small dance'. Why do _YOU start\nwith the 'small dance'?\nSTEVE: Well, first of all, it's a fairly easy perception: all you have to do\nis stand up and then relax-you know-and at a certain point you real-\nize that you've relaxed everything that you can relax but you're still\nstanding and in that standing is quite a lot of minute movement: .. the\nskeleton holding you upright even though you 're mentally relaxing.\nNow in that very fact of you ordering yourself to relax and yet continuing\nto stand-finding that limit to which you could no further relax without\nfalling down; you 're put in touch with a basic sustaining effort that goes\non constantly in the body, that you don't have to be aware of. It's\nbackground movement static-you know-that you blot out with your\nmore interesting activities, yet it's always there sustaining you. We 're\ntrying to get in touch with these kinds of primal forces in the body and\nmake them readily apparent. Call it the 'small dance' ... It was a name\nchosen largely because it's quite descriptive of the situation and because\nwhile you 're doing the stand and feeling the 'small dance' you 're aware\nthat you 're not 'doing' it, so, in a way, you 're watching yourself perform;\nwatching your body perform its function. And your mind is not figuring\nanything out and not searching for anv answers or being used as an\nactive instrument but is being used as a lens to focus on certain\nperceptions. DC",

    "Text": "I learn from knowing I am uncomfortable, and going ahead; and the\ngoing ahead being the letting-go-ahead. So the discomfort is to be appreciated.\nIt is an environment from which springs an opening. Contact embraces this\nfear of itself. this seminal verge.\nWe are concerned with where the dancing originates. At times it\nappears to me that the important thing is not the dancing in the center of the\ncircle. but the experience on the edge of the circle, the often disquieting\ndance on the verge. This view, which might be seen as antithetical to the\nwork. is also necessarily part of its premise. The invitation to feel the dread of\nopening is an inherent part of the total occurrence.\nDances in which both bodies ride a shared wave of truly unleashed\nrise and falling are rare. Yet the dances which abound - halting, starting\nrepeatedly, responding to impulses a fraction of a second too slow to flow,\ndoubting one's perceptions - are rich with valuable information, honest\nmanifestation of fluctuation between positive and negative response. We\nfear surrender. make our homes in the almost, and venture into readiness\nonly when we must. The discomfort at the verge serves by intensifying the\ncontrast: the darks get darker, the lights lighter, and the picture gets easier\nto see.\nI value this work not only for the rare glimpses of in-touch, in-time,\nin-tune. but for the companionship of the ever-present indications of what is\npossible. The form itself, if one exists beyond the instances of attempts to\nexperience it. is none other than the existence of the possibility of a dance in\nwhich wills. instincts. and verges merge. Emergency, emerge, merge. It\namounts to having to believe in a possibility which one may never have .\nexperienced.\nAll this to say I am devoted to something which I rarely feel, the\npossibility of which I never leave. We extend to ourselves an invitation which\nwe rarely accept. but the extension of it is what matters. Living for so long on\nthe verge of that acceptance, I figure it's time to call it home. o0",

    "Text": "For the last month I've been going down to\nWesleyan University on Fridays to teach two l '12 hour\nclasses in Contact Improvisation. Though I've been liking\nthe students a great deal, I've been grumbling a lot during\nthe week about the classes being too short. But now the\ngrumbling is bothering me more than the shortness of the\nclasses, so it's time to look into the whole ordeal.\nThe whole ordeal is about time, not enough of it, or\nmore specifically, not enough of a certain kind of it.\nWhen I teach beginning Contact Improvisation, there\nare a few principles I come back to over and over-some\nfor safety reasons, others for flavor. Some have to do with\nexpanding one's orientation to space-experiencing space\nas spherical, dealing with disorientation, being able to fall,\nroll, and ride momentum, alone and in physical contact\nwith another mover. I suppose this could be called spatial\nconditioning.\nThen there's time conditioning, which I'm just beginning\nto take particular notice of. A lot of the meditations on\nphysical sensation (e.g. Paxton's \"small dance\") that have\nalways been a part of Contact training are actually as much\nabout inducing an experience of expanded time as they are\nabout the physical sensations they point up.\nThis sense of expanded time is a subjective state, one\nwhere time feels mutable and there are slippages-where a\n45 minute dance can feel like 5 minutes, while a 2 second\nfall can feel luxuriously long. It is a relaxed state, one\nwhere time seems to have been released from its inexorable\nunit-to-unit march and allowed to roam in an open field\nwith wide horizons and no fences, a time whose divisions\nand textures vary according to the moods and perceptions\nof the people moving through it.\nAs with spatial training, this new temporal experience\nmay be puzzling at first. All too often you lose your place\nin the dancing, but you find out through experience that\nif you just hang on a few seconds longer (those seconds feel\nlike hours!) your place will come floating up under you like\na pair of lost footprints. You come to trust and in fact look\nforward to those gaps because in them you 're as vulnerable\nand available as you can be, and from there come new per-\nceptions and some of the more surprising and refreshing\nmovement material.\nBut how do we get there from here? Especially when\nwe 're coming in to the studio from Chemistry or Shakes-\npeare or Ballet or a 65 mile drive.\nThe transition from clock time to internal time can\nbegin during the personal warmup-a period of time often\ngiven at the beginning of class to relax and \"arrive,\" to get\nready physically and mentally to dance with others. It\ndeepens during the periods of extended duet improvising.\nAbsorption in the moment expands the feeling of time and\nyou come out of it enlivened no matter where you've been.\nIt's this state of absorption and enlivening that I aim for in\nmy own dancing and teaching.\nI spent the first few weeks at Wesleyan searching in vain\nfor a quick passage, a trap door into this state. But how\ncould I hope to transmit the spaciousness, mutability, and\nmystery of time when I myself was rushing to get in as much\ndancing, skills, improvising, sensitizing, etc. as possible in\nthe 'short' time available?\nExhausted from my struggle with time, I gave up and\nfound that simply by relaxing I created more time. It felt\nlike practicing Aikido, where one redirects an opposing\nforce by first blending with it, not resisting it. Meanwhile,\nof course, as I was internally wrestling with all this, the\nstudents were rolling, giggling, getting dizzy, getting strong,\nconfused, inspired, thinking it was silly, feeling it was\nprofound and in general doing Contact Improvisation. As\nhas often been said, the dancing teaches itself, if the teacher\ncan only get out of the way long enough to let everyone\ndance ....\nP.S. After all this, I still think an hour and a half is too\nshort for a Contact class!",

All those cows bent to the water, the lines of their backs, helped me\nre-invent the wheel. At the watering hole we stood in order to bring our\nweight down; our weight brought the water up. We came full circle.\nThis time we started again with nothing. New moon. We collected ourselves.\nAs the last light left, we arranged ourselves in a blind configuration; (blackout\non stage, the lights come up and the performers arc all in place). We started.\nThen the crescent moon - we seemed to use the light as it grew, filling in the\nimplied circle. Journal entry, March 24: \" ... Musing new directions, transition\nat its most spread out point, as entropy of possibilities peaks.\" The moon, a new\nimage to fill, and we, in as much detail as possible, articulate the filling.\nLearning the ropes means knowing how far they can take you; how much weight\nthey can hold. One day, the arc of the rope's swing is predictable and suddenly\nshort. There is another side; the side just outside your reach. But is your reach\nthe rope's, or, if you can find a vehicle with a larger range should you ride it. \"Lim-\nits are what any of us are inside of,\" Charles Olson said in a talk that was recorded.\nIn ReUnion's Contact classes we often talk during the warm up. Not necessarily to\nsuggest specific activities, exercises or structures, but to create an environment, to\nsupply images that may call out a particular awareness. We talk to the body as\nit experiences sensation. We say, \"You know that place when you stretch, the\nplace where the muscle has eased out to its limit, that place on the edge of\nstress, on the edge of pain.\" We say, \"Work there, spend some time there,\non this side of the edge.\" \"The edge is home,\" Lee Breuer said during a\nradio interview in Washington, D.C. in 1975. But it seems the edge is\nmoveable - that by sensing the limit, respecting it, you encourage it\nto open. A push comes to a shove. But if you go only as far as you\nare welcome, you are invited back.\nWhat has this got to do with the Contact Quarterly.

    "Text": "Contact Improvisation is a dance form that uses movement, gravity and their relationship to each other as revealed through changing points of balance. It is a dance that is neither in balance nor over the edge. It is a dance that is not predetermined, a dance where the dancers disappear and there is only the dance. It is a dance that is accessible to all, regardless of one's physical abilities. It is a dance that is a metaphor for our lives and that has therapeutic value. It is a dance that has spiritual elements, where we contact, or more likely what contacts us during those dances that are out of our constraint, where a third body is created.\n\nContact Improvisation is a dance that is sheltered under the aegis, the protection, of the founders' predilection for not creating certifications, degrees, professional associations and strict definitions of the form. It is a dance that creates imagery from a broad variety of sources, explores related disciplines, expresses points of view, but ultimately dismisses absolutes. It is a dance that at its best is fluid, and how easy it would be to concretize into a set of exercises and rules this protean dance form.\n\nContact Improvisation is a dance that is like Rumi's poetry, limenal. It is a dance that expresses the dances that are not predetermined, those rare moments when the dancers disappear and there is only the dance.",

    "Text": "The work I have done in Contact Improvisation has, needless to say, had a powerful eff~ct in my\nlife. In the late spring of 1972 Steve told me of a piece he wanted to do in N.Y.C., and I went down\nthere to rehearse and perform a dance called Contact Improvisation. The work that was done for that\nperformance and subsequent gatherings for intense periods of dancing was larger and affected more\nlevels of my being than I was aware of at the time. Most forceably I was struck by the simple yet over-\nwhelming experience of communion with another person achieved through the dancing, and the freedom\nas well as discipline found within that communi~n. I remember feeling literally transported to another\nworld when dancing, a world in which I was able to become a stronger self than I lived with day to day.\nI don't think, in that first performance, anyone fully realized the power of the forces brought into play\namong us. Many injuries, pulled, sore, and knotted muscles were the physical result of irresponsibility\nin the face of those forces. I became impressed with a sense of responsibility to myself and those I was\ndancing with to create a healthy interaction.\nThe work done during that concert became not something I could forget. The realm of Contact\nImprovisation I realized was not \"dance\" but living, the forces at play between two people dancing are\nthose forces which exist day to day, the strong self I had experienced was nothing but myself. I was left\nwith the ever present challenge to realize my strong self in day to day living as well as the responsibility\nof achieving a healthy and true communion with those people I meet day to day. I suppose this task\nis universal for all living beings, however I have received a lot of strength and focused energy specifically\nfrom the work I have done with Contact Improvisation.\nI realize now that in order to continue this work I must be involved in the process of transmission.\nlt'seems that with understanding and experience of the forces at play in Contact Improvisation, receiving\nbecomes transmitting, student becomes teacher, dancing becomes giving. It seems very natural, and I\ndo not hesitate to think that any one who has had enough experience with Contact will feel this shift of\nrole. It is no wonder there are now many teachers of Contact Improvisation.\nThe dancing is just beginning to expand on a social level, into our society. What will be the direction\nof this expansion? Contact was created in the context of the dance art world. This is a good place, how-\never the traditions of possession and ownership among artists are unhealthy for Contact Improvisation.\nMy dream is that Contact will grow to become a social function. Periodically people living in the same\narea will gather for a day or week of dancing, for the sole function of communally reinforcing and acknow-\nledging the strong self inside each person in the face of those one lives with. Walking down the street and\ngreeting someone, buying groceries in a store, and all the daily interactions of people will be on a truer\nmore realistic footing, and a general climate of health may be achieved. This may seem far fetched but\nI feel the beginning is at hand and in view of this direction it is obvious that we need to:\ncontinue dancing and deepening our experience and familiarity with\nthe forces at play in Contact Improvisation\nkeep lines of communication open, i.e. this newsletter,\nand cooperatively give and share the experiences and\ninformation gleaned from dancing and teaching.\nThe class I tried to start in Bennington this summer did not work out. I am trying again this fall\nto get some people together to dance. I think I will be picking apples this fall. The seasons are changing\nhere, color on the trees and colder nights and shorter days, new feelings emerge and don't fit comfortably\nyet. Hope to see some of you again, maybe hit the west coast again this year.\nHello to All",

The\nweight and awkwardness of the mater-\nials, plywood, two-by-fours, and other\nconstruction hardware, turned building\na piece into a physical work-out.\nSculpting was an arranging dance,\nusing the whole body.\nDuring this time (1973), Curt Sid-\ndall, Nita Little, Steve Paxton, Nancy\nStark Smith, and someone whom I re-\nmember well except for her name\n[Karen Radler] came to perform and\nteach contact on the west coast for\nthe first time. I danced some and\nwatched a lot. The idea of people\npresenting natural movement as a\nperformance was a pleasant jolt to me.\nThe democratic give and take between\npartners was appealing. Improvising\ndance, creating while performing was,\nfor me, a revelation. And my person-\nality was more comfortable with the\nsocial circumstances of dancing than\nthe solitude of sculpture.\nMy first dancing was suffused with\ncomparisons between sculpture and\ncontact. It was as if the four-by-eight\nplywood sheets I had been building\nwith developed power steering, and\ncould even lift me off the ground.\nThe three-dimensional experience of\nsculpture became four-dimensional,\nthe fourth dimension being the time\nof the dance. I was no longer the\nmanipulator. For every impulse of\nmine, there was another independent\nnervous system deciding what was hap-\npening as well. I saw that contact is\nvery purely about process. In terms\nof sculpture, that meant showing how\nfascinating it is to make a piece, rather\nthan showing a finished piece.\nThrough performing, I like letting\nothers in on the creating side of the\nwork, the side most interesting to me.\nSince that time, I've performed in\nmany different situations; contact,\nother improvised structures, and set\npieces. In watching dance or perform-\ning it, I'm drawn to dancing which\ndoesn't impose a style on the people\nwho dance. This may partly be a\nhangover from art training which en-\ncourages students to find an individual\nvision from the start of training. I'm\nglad this idea has a lot of credence in\nthe dance world now.\nImprovisation is one way of work-\ning individualistically either in a group\nor solo. A problem is that improvisa-\ntion and performance are sometimes\nfriends. We all know of our on nights\nand our off nights. Those who perform\nimprovisation have decided that the\npluses outweigh the minuses. The\npluses are that the dancers are present-\ning a raw slice of life, uncut, uncooked.\nThe audience's position is elevated be-\ncause they are allowed to get in on the\nwhole story as it happens for the first\ntime. They aren't watching something\nwhich has been edited in rehearsal.\nImprovisation is risky and often re-\nwarding for the performers. It is a way\nfor performers to move on with work,\nnot to stick with an image or sequence\n\n\"What did you think of what you saw, asked Miss Stein . . .\nOnly that Picassos were rather awful and the others were not.\nSure, she said, as Pablo once remarked, when you make a thing,\nit is so complicated making it that it is bound to be ugly, but\nthose that do it after you they don't have to worry about making\nit and they can make it pretty, and so everybody can like it\nwhen the others make it.\"\n\nGertrude Stein\n\nwhich must be repeated several times.\nThe formal qualities of contact make\nit a focused and grounded improvisa-\ntional technique. There is a basic\nagreement between performers which\nprovides a continual springboard into\nthe dance. A performer of contact has\na lot of freedom.\nI'm sitting here writing about how\ngood a performance improvisation\nmakes, and resisting tooth and nail the\ndetractions. However, there are some.\nThere is no overall structure to control\nthe impact of the performance. It's\nlike having several small dances linked\ntogether. Dull repetition can be a\nproblem. When this happens, it's like\nwatching the same rehearsed dance\nseveral times in one piece. This is one\nof the main limitations in previous\ndance work which many of us are try-\ning to avoid by investigating improvi-\nsation. An ideal piece has few seams\nshowing. There are a lot of ways to\napproach this, but they mostly have to\ndo with pre-planning. It's difficult to\nachieve in an improvised performance.\nThere also are some beautiful possibili-\nties in pre-setting a piece; it can have\nlong sections of synchronized move-\nment, it can be a story, it can have\nspecial timing, or it can deal with the\npersonae and not the personality of\nthe performer. The search for these\nqualities is improvised but their presen-\ntation is, for the most part, set.\nSafety is important in contact.\nThis results in contact being playful,\ngame-like, and positive. There is a\nutopian communal quality to contact-\na great experience but not the whole\npicture. This one-keyed quality can be\nlimiting for an audience, and make\nperforming frustrating. There is little\nroom to explore subjects like discord,\ntragedy, or events which are fantastic\nor grotesque. Sometimes I want to\nentertain/be entertained with these\nrich images. Sometimes I want the\npurity and abstraction of contact.\nWhen I perform contact, I like to\nfeel that we, the performers, are shar-\ning the performance with the audience.\nAmong the most satisfying perform-\nances in this respect was a series done\nat the Paula Cooper Gallery in New\nYork City [1978). We performed in\nthe afternoon for three days, three\nhours per day. The audience was free\nto come and go. Those who stayed\nwanted to be there. As the perform-\nance progressed, the size and closeness\nof the audience increased. Neither the\naudience nor the piece was set. There\nwas a cumulative effect from perform-\ning for a long time for three days in a\nrow. Our dancing became very sure,\nand many audience members returned\ntwo or three times to watch. By the\nend of the third day we all felt like\ngood friends. We felt like the home\nteam.\nIn the last year, I've been doing\ncontact wearing different costumes.\nThe costumes put a context into the\ndancing. Nina Martin and I did cos-\ntumed contact as part of a living sculp-\nture exhibit at the Susan Caldwell\nGallery. Every half-hour or so, we\nchanged clothes. We danced in paja-\nmas, swimming suits, winter clothes,\nformal attire, and disco polyester. The\ncostumes interest me because they\nprovide a lasting image, however weird,\nof what the dancing is about. A sub-\nliminal story unfolded with each\nchange. (Paul and Nina went to the\nprom all dressed up. They felt good\nand started rolling on top of each\nother. Nina's hat got squashed, so she",

    "Text": "In ordinary, every-day situations, to make contact\nthere have to be two. That seems a commonplace\nand we simply take it for granted. Watching Con-\ntact Improvisation, however, is a strange experience\nat first. The making, keeping, and stretching of\ncontact, there, does not easily fit the accustomed\nconceptual schema. It takes quite a while to discov-\ner the reason: Its contacts involve not two but four.\nIn the world of our experience, what we call our \"self\"\nis no more and no less than what we experience of our-\nselves. In terms of our senses, our \"self\" is composed of\nwhat we perceive of ourselves, visually and tactually for the\nmost part, plus what we internally sense about the states of\n, our muscles and organs. This \"self\" is necessarily very different\nfrom what we are in the experiential world of another person who,\nvisually and tactually, experiences us from a wholly different point of\nview. In Contact Improvisation, therefore, there are two selves, each striving to maintain\ncontact with another person. Both are constantly the acting subject of their own actions, and at\nthe same time they are the object of the other's actions. And since the possibilities of making\nand maintaining contact are nearly always many, the coordination of motion of the one\ndancer that perceives the other and the other that perceives the one, is threatened\nat every moment. There is a perpetual struggle to neutralize inherent discrepan-\ncies and to preserve a reciprocally invariant relationship of contact. Seen from\nthe outside, this becomes a powerful and at times shattering allegory of the\nprecariousness of any harmony in human relations.\nIf this is not too idiosyncratic an interpretation, it must raise the question:\nWill Contact Improvisation really remain a moment-to-moment improv-\nisation or will it gradually develop regularities, fixed sequences, and\nrules? Contact of two independent agents can be maintained only to\nthe extent to which one can foresee the motions of the other. (That\ngoes for ALL relationships, and that is why we always need some\nrules and conventions). To IMPROVE in the art of Contact Improv-\nisation (or in the art of relating to others) may mean to get better at\npredicting the· other's moves AS WELL AS to get better at doing\nwhat 'he orhe-r ex pee.rs.",

    "Text": "In Banyoles, Spain, two hours north of Barcelona,\nthere is a 16th-century stone farmhouse with a horsebarn\nmade into a spacious dance studio. Three large windows\nopen directly onto manure-rich hay fields. It's harvest time\nand the old Spanish farmers throw the bales one by one\nonto simple wooden carts pulled by old-model tractors.\nThe first night of our workshop we meet only briefly in\nthe studio. In the evening's waning light, we 'arrive'-from\nDenmark, Germany, America, Switzerland-we stretch and\nbreathe, arriving f;om the road, arriving into our bodies,\ninto the room, smelling the fields, hearing the pigs squeal\nand sing altogether in their pens, feeding, down the road.\nWithout much plan, we dance in the deepening blue light\nthat obscures faces but leaves a rich glow that's inviting to\ndance in. We stand back from the windows, putting what's\nleft of the light in front of us, and dance and watch each\nother in silence. I like this beginning very much. It's un-\nadorned and mysterious. Spacious and intimate. We're\nready already. It's nice here.\nTwo weeks later. A lot has happened. As usual with an\nintensive workshop, it's been intense. We seem to have\nrisked a lot, been satisfied and confused, tired and exuber-\nant, alone and together here by the ripe fig tree in northern\nSpain, and now it's time to go. Some don't want to leave,\nothers are ready, curious to see what new directions these\nweeks will produce in their work. Soon the goodbye com-\nmittee, waving the others off, whittles down to a solitary\nfew. Bill and I decide to stay at Arlequi for an extra day,\nto not rush leaving, and-very unusual for me-to stay not\nonly to the end, but after the end.\nI found Bill in the studio after everyone was gone, sitting\nin the windowframe watching the farmer turning over his\nfield in the evening light. A brush fire was burning up on\nthe hill, and it all seemed very still. The light was just as it\nhad been the first night we came-blueblack, highlighting\nsurfaces. The room looks small, and so empty, I thought.\nHow incredible that so much can happen in a place and it\nstays empty when you go. That you can fill it so full and\nleave and it's still empty.\nWhat I mean is, Yolanda cried out when we changed from\nfire to earth state and Ole held onto her until her writhing\npassed. She was Spanish, he was Danish, and ... days later\nOle crashed heads with his friend J orgen, both rushing out\nof the studio dazed and confused and coming back in later\nlaughing. And Marie, living through the special dance she\ntells of in this issue's \"Still Moving\" column. I guess it's\nreally so obvious, especially to dancers, that so much can\ngrow out of thin air-that just a bunch of people moving\nand thinking and talking and seeing can generate such ap-\nparent substance and then be gone without a trace.\nThe ending continued. As soon as we waved the last\nperson off at the bus, the weather changed dramatically. It\nrained all the next day as it hadn't the whole two weeks we\nwere there. New tenants arrived, invisibly dividing the\nhouse into theirs and ours. It was as if some Red Sea that\nhad parted now closed over, making the clearing we had\nlived in for two weeks not just changed but completely\ngone. The figs were still there, ripe and heavy in their\nteardrop sacs hanging from the tree. You could run your\nfingernail down the side of the soft thick brown mottled\nskin, open the fig and find deep red fruit moist and\ndelicious, so satisfying, so perfect after dancing.",

    "Text": "Contact improvisation is a move-\nment technique. Though much young-\ner than ballet or modern dance, it\nproves to be as rich and dee~. It ei_n-\nbodies a progression of physical skills\nwhich can be used to train the begin-\nner as well as challenge the virtuoso.\nStudents of contact improvisation\nacquire access to a large realm of\nmovement very quickly and begm to\nmake significant changes in their\nmovement patterns, strength, and sen-\nsitivity within three or four classes.\nThis makes the technique particularly\ndesirable for the theater student and\nnon-dancer.\n\nThe skills acquired in contact im-\nprovisation are by no means limited\nto the form itself. A deep understand-\ning of weight, movement flow, and use\nof strength greatly aid anybody who\ndesires to study ballet, modern dance,\nor other physical disciplines. The ex-\ntensive exposure to the physical and\nmental states involved in improvising\nand discovering movement can help\nchoreographers in their attempts to\ngather material for their set work.\nContact improvisation directly\nstrengthens one's presence. Just as\none can become aware of the eyes\nseeing, the ears hearing, and the skin\nfeeling, one can become aware of the\nmind sensing. Through practice of\nthis dance form one becomes able to\nexperience and observe the state of\none's nervous system particularly\nwhen in an intimate physical relation-\nship with another. This spawns an\nelement of control over one's percep-\ntual reality. This control and ability\nto focus is training in developing pow-\ner. Personal power and strength of\npresence is essential in any performing\nsituation as well as in daily life.\nContact improvisation nurtures a\nbasic physical trust between two\npeople and among a group. The form\ndemands a care and consideration of\none's partner and towards this end\nseeks to develop sensitivity and con-\nfidence. This trust and the freedom\nwhich ensues kindles a rich and fertile\nenvironment for working creatively\nwith another person. Knowledge and\nexperience of this environment aids\nin any situation where people are\nworking together, actors on stage\ndoing a scene, or dancers performing\na piece.\n\nThe working relationships which\ndevelop in this form cross the bound-\naries created by sexual roles; men\ndance with men, women with women,\nand men with women alike. I do not\nknow of anv artistic discipline in\nwhich non-~exual, deep, and honest\nphysical contact is explored with_ to-\ntal equality relative to sex. In this\nform women lift men as often as men\nlift women. Women learn to exercise\na kind of strength which often has\nnever been encouraged, likewise men\nlearn to allow themselves a soft, re-\nsponsive, and non-competitive posture.\nIt is a revelation to both partners that\na one hundred and eighty pound man\ncan be easily & completely supported\nby a one hundred pound woman.\nAgain, the trust derived from freeing\nthe traditional sexual roles creates a\nmore comfortable and fluid atmos-\nphere among any group of artists\nseeking to work together.\nContact improvisation seems to be\nof particular value for the college age\nperson. College students find them-\nselves in an intense period of transi-\ntion. They are coming to grips with\nthe image and reality of themselves\nas adults. Thev are intently exploring\nthe psychological politics of sexual\nrelationships. This form offers them\na grounded, simple, and clear oppor-\ntunity to interact deeply and honestly\nwith each other. It seems to serve as\na reference point or forum for expe-\nriencing oneself in relationship with\nothers in an unthreatening environ-\nment and without the need to formu-\nlate consciouslv or to talk about what\nis going on. The strongest evidence\nfor the emotional supportive value of\nthis work is the very real attraction\nstudents have for this form. They\nwant to experiment and expand. This\nform gives them the opportunity to\ngo ahead.\nIn and of itself contact improvisa-\ntion has become a significant move-\nment within the dance world, recog-\nnized bv audiences and critics as a\nfascinating and evocative performance\nexperience. Many up and coming\ndancers and actors are using the skills\nthey've acquired through practice of\nthis form to advance themselves in\ntheir artistic work. Considering its\nvalue as a supportive discipline for\nthe actor studying theater or the danc-\ner studying traditional techniques, as\nwell as its presence as a new and viable\ndance form, I feel no hesitation in\nrecommending to any college or uni-\nversity that contact improvisation be\na permanent part of the curriculum of\nany program in dance or theater.",

    "Text": "WHERE YOU GOIN' WITH THAT GUN I Setting Our Sights\n\n\"A writer is not someone who has something to say, he is someone who has found a process that will bring about new things\nthat he would not have thought of if he had started to say them.\"\nWilliam Stafford\n\nThe daily jogger, on the other hand, is focused more on internal movement sensations: the rhythm of\nbreath, the beat of heart, the sweep of momentum, the impact with the earth. Wheres/he is going is not on the map-\nthough s/he has to cover ground to get there. Though it is the movement and not the direction that is significant, a\ndirection must nevertheless be chosen in order to proceed.\n\nFor a long time it appeared that Contact Improvisation was more concerned with sensation than achievement and direction. There is the sense in practicing Contact that anything is 'right'. Anything goes. Yet there is a limit. How broad an activity can be before it has no parameters at all and we are left with what we call life, or in this case, human experience. When, in 1977, Steve Paxton observed, \"Just the pleasure of using your body is, I think, maybe the main thing-in an unplanned and spontaneous way, where you're free to invent and they're free to invent and you're free to invent with each other-that's a very pleasant social form.\" However, it was by first establishing priorities that Contact was able to provide its particular kind of pleasure.\n\nContact can be seen as a means for communicating through physical contact. Dialogue proceeds, using the exchange of weight between partners to tune them to the physical forces that effect their motion and to tune them to each other. At the outset of Contact Improvisation, a choice was made to minimize the social content of the contact and to work, initially, with the physical elements involved in the exchange. Stated or by example implied, this choice along with others brought depth to the practice of Contact by limiting its scope. By narrowing the focus of the activity, subtle information was made visible: the experience of gravity; the \"small dance\" of the skeleton balancing erect; the flow of weight through the body as it rolls across the floor; the exchange of weight between partners during lifting, throwing and catching; the sensation of sharing a dynamic center of balance with another mover.\n\nIt has been 8 years since the decision to work with these specific physical elements. In this time, practice has revealed many principles that, serving as anchors, allowed the scope of partner exchange to widen. The practice of CI continues to suggest ways in which its principles and skills can be applied. Following these suggestions leads to fascinating work in dance, theatre, therapy and education. As the concern with physical contact and weight exchange becomes less of a focus in their work, many Contactors wonder whether they are still doing \"Contact Improvisation\". Others continue their studies regardless, not caring one way or the other what it is called.\n\nContact, as an evolving system, tends to attract the forces that work to open what is fixed, change what is static. Ever since its formation as the Contact Newsletter in 1975, Contact Quarterly has reflected this eagerness to find relevance in a broad range of sources. In considering the direction of our interests, as editors we ask ourselves, 'What does shooting guns have to do with Contact Improvisation?' In shooting, one tests the accuracy with which a message of energy (power) can be delivered to a distant point (moving or still). As a 'vehicle for moving ideas', Contact Quarterly shares that aim.",

    "Text": "On Saturday afternoon August 20, 1977, some thirty participants and teachers of FOCUS 8/77 gathered\nto talk about the Politics of Contact. The issue was as much one of defining the question or concern as it was coming\nup with an answer. The discussion began with a minimal definition of politics: awareness of and concern for the\npower relationships in a given interaction or situation, particularly those relationships which are unacknowledged.\nor assumed and unquestioned. From this beginning the discussion was wide-ranging, spirited and largely unstructured.\nGoing back over a ta pc-recording of the seminar a month later, I have selected out and arranged (without\nregard to original sequence) representative and provocative comments to share with the larger contact community.\nTo my knowledge this discussion was the first attempt to look at our work from this perspective and clearly it is only\none small step, but an important one. In retrospect, I saw our talk centering around two issues.· The first was seldom\ndefined as a focus but kept surfacing in people's comments: what kind of needs are filled by contact improvisation'?\nConsuelo: I was interested in figuring out why it's come down that because of privilege like the $125\nprivilege and the class background privilege, why it is that this environment has developed around\ncontact; but I don't see that contact itself is this white cultural kind of ...\nJohn: I'm not sure I agree with that, for one thing it's demonstrating the needs ... contact like anything\nelse is fulfilling certain needs.\nEleva: That's what I was going to say earlier, perhaps it's the white middle class that needs to get in touch\nwith their bodies.\nTom: What I see it gets down to is am I willing to go into the world receptively and attentively to what's\nhappening around me and to be in touch with my needs in a particular situation and other people's\nneeds. I really think it is something about the reason we're here is because we need to be here, else\nwe wouldn't be here, to learn whatever we're getting from this, and I see it very much in spiritual terms ...\nthis group of people is here to get what we're getting and I think a lot of people don't need it or are\ndoing it in another form.\nElizabeth: The same kinds of things that happen in contact are things that I think have happened to other\nkinds of people in other situations, like in work situations where men do heavy physical work together\nand might have to use their bodies in the same kind of cooperation and same kind of sensitivity to each\nother ... but different than a dance situation ... which comes with a different kind of awareness.\nBroni: Its purpose is different too.\nMark: This may relate to why this kind of event is strictly one ethnic group or one social class. I'm con-\ncerned in society all over the country how it seems there's a great gap between this kind of situation\nof workshops and focusing on a specific kind of dance and what I would call the masses ... their\ndesire to move and to socialize and be part of something which is being generally exploited. For\nthose people who are not coming to studio spaces and being part of something, the whole word dance\nmeans to them Friday night and swallowing a six pack of beer and going to a bar or disco; I think\nit's exploitative and I really feel there's a gap between that space and this space and it's really tough\nto breach.\njerry: Contact has a lot in common with folk art and we are a folk ... we invent it as we go along, we\nmake it out of what we've got and the fact that what we've got is a college education, and money,\nand attractive healthy bodies, and good teeth, you know, is different from having a bunch of ma-\nhogany trees and a couple of rocks ... Contact improvisation has roots in dance, it was found by\ndancers, and it has gone away from being a dance thing; it is a movement form. There are people\nhere who are not primarily dancers and the form is reaching out toward those people the way some\npeople seem to think we should be reaching out toward different classes of society or different\nethnic groups.\nMark: I feel that there are some aspects of this kind of dance that are slightly different than any kind of\nparticular outlet that supplies the needs for any particular ethnic group. I really feel that there are\nsome aspects of contact that are evolutionary .. I can't think, unless somebody can fill the space, of\nother kinds of dance in the past which have been this free with sharing and this much touch and con-\nnections .. I think this kind of dance is more significant in specific kinds of problems, like sexual\npolitics, for example, men dancing with men ... and even in the sense that it doesn't rely upon other\nforms like music - goes right to an essence or centering ... This form of dance crosses a few more\nbridges than others have.\nConsuelo: You mean in the sense that it is kind of like a future vision of how people can relate to each\nother in terms of sensitivity and activity?\nJon: In terms of sexual politics we're still dealing with one on one, two people getting together, and contact\ngives you metaphors for expanding that to three or four or ten or twenty or whatever and that should\nbe explored too. ·\nKeriac: Watching a ballet that gets into these boy.girl things, I don't get much metaphor for my life from\nthose; whereas I really find the material in contact, the interpersenal stuff that's happening in contact,\nis a really useful sophisticated metaphor for what I'm experiencing. ·\nConsuelo: Right now I feel really committed to art for change. It's really not enough to do a contact\nperformance for me, it really isn't. I feel like I want to know more what's going to come out and\ndeliver a message; and I don't mean just whatever message is there but I mean pretty specific messages.\nKris: There's something about pure energy that gets exchanged between people, we become something\nof everything we are around, and when I see a performance I become those performers; and it means\na lot to me and it's the strongest and most pure learning experience I have and it's devoid of content.\nIt's not statements.\nConsuelo: Well, that sounds like a pretty powerful statement.\nI see that most of these needs in relation to contact have to do with the desire to break down the uneven\npower of the various roles that people assume in relating to one another, be it male to male, dancer to nondancer,\nor performer to audience. Contact improvisation as a political process can thus be seen as a means for bringing\npeople together in a way that prevents or at least discourages the assumption of roles and inequalities of power\nwhich roles so often establish. There seemed to be agreement that, on an immediate personal level, contact achieved\nthis aim if the integrity of the physical form was respected.\nThe second issue of the discussion seemed to center around the kind of relationship the contact community\nand the contact form is establishing with the larger society. Does and will this relationship maintain the same freedom\nfrom inequalities in power and thus allow all people access to the vital (role-less?) movement relationships which are\ncontact improvisation?\nKaren: The way to deal with it is to work on both levels - one is on the normal ground level of literally\ndealing, believing that change takes place and revolution takes place within my own body first and\nthen at the same time being aware of where my body is: is it in the studio, in Cat's Paw, and that\ndoor is closed unless I have $125, and then what do I do about that; and I think there are two dif-\nferent issues and both are necessary.\nBrent: But we made this experience available for ourselves ... at least I did.\nKaren: Because it is within your program in life to be able to do that. We're talking about a whole part\nof the world where it isn't part of the program - it's not there ... so is art going to be something\nwe're talking about, an eclectic thing that stays where it is, or can this particular art form go out\nbecause it doesn't have to have all that professional dilettantism that other forms have. Can it just\nbe a way of reaching people on another basis?\nLaurie: Not right now.\njohn: This is a white middle class trip and other people out of that might not necessarily want to have it.\nLaurie: And they might and they can't because they can't afford to.\nJohn: That's not true.\nLaurie: If one person wants to and can't ...\nJohn: There have been set up free situations for people to study this and it is only taken by white upper\nclass people. '\nErnie: Sometimes it becomes a real trip that we are laying on them because we don't have the sensitivity\nto know what they need.\nMark: What is the balance between being crusaders for contact and making it an available form for those\nthat are interested?\nJohn: It is a manifestation I think in many ways of class differences and therefore class problems that we\nshould deal with; solutions are tough.\nEvelyn: Most of the arts are a social ... I mean there's a certain class of people that do them. For a long\ntime they were a very elitest thing.\nErnie: But is it elitist? That word really blows my mind cause it's a power term. It assumes that if we\ndevelop a dance form, it is automatically elitist. It's a dance form! ... something that came out of\nour culture. Our culture may be elitist in a lot of ways - money and social structures generally, but\nthat doesn't mean the dance form is elitist.\nLaurie: But it reflects the society.\nKaren: I am forever grateful in one way, in an aesthetic sense, and in other ways, for things that have come\nout of formalized, in a sense elitist, art forms and I value them. Then I hear what we're saying on the\nother side. Now is there room for both ways to be?\nKeriac: If you are thinking of contact as a folk art and experiencing it, it is quite a different setup than if\nyou are thinking of it as a performing art or a spectator thing. Like Karen was talking about, how can\nwe have both of these things, that they both enrich our lives? I think that it is facetious to say that\nit is a folk art so that we can all rest our minds about that, you know, that we don't have to be con-\ncerned about ... that we're clean; this is a folk art, it's ok. One can use contact lots of other ways -\nthe relative morality, the rightness or wrongness or whether it fits into your value system should be\nexamined.\nErnie: If you take something like contact ... and you can make it into where you're more sensitive to\nlife in general, the balances and flux of life in general, then it becomes evolutionary; but if you take\nit and it becomes another package, then that's what it is, another package.\nSome questions arc asked. concerns expressed and a dialogue begins. I hope the excerpts above may have\nprovoked thoughts in you and that you will share them with others. It is part of the dance. I hope that l have not\ndistorted too much the meaning of what people said by taking comments out of context or order. And in reading,\nplease realize the text above is in some sense my interpretation, my reflection, my recreation of what took place.\nYou had to be there. . . ·",

    "Text": "\"Center of gravity\" seems to have a lot of meanings for dancers. If you look the term up in a\nphysics book, you find about half a page; they seem to think that it's so simple as not to be worth discussing\na lot. But the concept is pretty deep when you think about it and use it to look at movement. Here I will\nbe talking about center of gravity in the same physical sense that a physicist would use the term. I will leave\naside meanings such as \"center from which you move\" or \"spiritual center,\" and try to show the richness of\nthe simply physical interpretation. However, I am emphatically not saying that dance is \"nothing but\nphysics\" - more about that later. First I will explain and define the center of gravity for a rigid body, and\nthen talk about the more interesting cases when the body changes shape and the center of gravity changes.\nC.Onsider the shapes in the first picture as made of flat cardboard, and imagine that you want to\nbalance each one on its edge on a pencil. Where would you put the pencil for each one so it would not\nturn or fall?\nThen suppose they were turned around, as below. Now where does the supporting point need to be for each?\nOK, what does this balance stuff have to do with the center of gravity? I assert that there is a\nunique point in or near each of these shapes, such that whenever this point is above the point of s11r--ort,\nthe shape wil I be balanced. This unique point is called the Center of Gravity. Another way to defin.\ncenter of gravity is the point around which the body is perfectly balanced: if you stuck a support through\nthe center of gravity, you could turn the body any way, and it would still balance, not tending to tip in any\ndirection.\nNow you really need to cut out a shape of cardboard and try it, to see if this concept works. Cut\nout an odd shape like one above, but bigger. Put it flat up against a vertical surface like a wall so it can't\nflop over, and balance the edge on a pencil. When you find one way it balances, hold it still and draw a line\nstraight up from the point of contact. Now balance it on a different edge,\nand draw another line straight up from this other point of contact. The\ntwo lines will meet, and this point of meeting should be the center of\ngravity. Is it? Well, if it really is, then any time this point is above the\npoint of support, the shape should balance. TRY IT in other positions.\nDoes it balance? Try putting the center of gravity above the point of\ncontact but to the left of it. Now the shape falls to the left, doesn't it?\nThe diagram below shows the forces. The two forces (weight and support).\naiming past one another, create torque\nthat turns the body. Whenever the\ncenter of gravity is not over the point\nof contact, the body tends to turn and fall on the side where the center\nof gravity is. It's as if all the mass were concentrated in the center of\ngravity. We use this turning and falling a lot. When you are standing and\nyou allow your center of gravity to wander until it's not over your feet\nany more, then you start to fall in that direction; you can allow the fall\nto continue, or use the momentum to go into a walk.\nTo go back to the first shapes, here they are again with the centers\nof gravity I found for each. Notice that in one case the center of gravity\nis outside the figure! This is hard to conceive of, except if you try to balance the shape many ways and see\nwhere the lines converge. Another way of getting an image of a center that is outside a body is to think of\na donut. For a donut, the center of gravity has to be inside the hole, no way around it.\nThe formal physical definition of center of gravity gives another perspective. Think of the body as\na set of segments, each of which has its own mass and position. The center of gravity is the point at which\nthe sum of all those masses times their (directional) distances is zero - the point at which all those masses\non all their lever arms cancel each other out. For a simple example, think of a seesaw. If one person on\nthe seesaw is a lot heavier, the lighter person can still make a balance by sitting way out on the end, to get\nleverage. To be exact, each person on the seesaw has a turning force (torque) equal to her/his mass times\nher/his distance from the balance point. So this combination in the picture would be balanced (assuming,\noh physics!, a weightless seesaw board).\nUsing the definition, it is possible to calculate the center of gravity for real people in different\npositions. I analyzed these two pictures and marked each person's center of gravity with an X. The\ntracing is my working drawing for the calculations of center of gravity.**\nIn the first photograph, notice how Nita's body balances around her left leg. Her right leg is\nsticking out, balanced by her head and torso leaning the other way. The head and torso are not leaning\nfar, but they are much heavier than the leg. Her center of gravity is close to the \"normal\" position for a\nstanding person (inside the pelvis, a little below the belly button), and it is directly above her foot, so she's\nstable. In that same picture, it's not immediately clear whether Steve is leaning on Nita or not. But see,\nhis center of gravity is not directly above his supporting foot, so he must be leaning on her, or be falling.\nComparing Steve's posture to normal standing, his left leg is tilted up and sideways relative to the straight\nline of his torso, and his left arm is also up and to the side. Hence, his center of gravity is not so near his\nbelly button, but is displaced up and to the left. From the cases I've looked at, the center of gravity can\nmove around 6 or 8 inches from its standard position in the body - not a huge distance, but enough to\nmake a difference. Because the head and torso are so heavy (being about 55% of the total weight of most\npeople), the center of gravity tends to stay around the belly.\nLlsa Nelson, Danny Lepkoff\nThe photo with Lisa Nelson nicely illustrates some points: her center of gravity is outside her body,\nbut it is still above the area of support, making a stable position. Note how her different body segments\nextend to the left and right of the support, but they balance out. A lot of parts, particularly her legs, are\nhanging off to the left of the center of gravity, but they are cancelled out by the weight of her torso and\nthighs to the right.\nWe change center of gravity when we change shape, and often compensate so automatically that we\naren't even aware of it. For example, if I start out standing and bend forward, my center shifts forward and\nI'd fall right over if I didn't make immediate subtle corrections. I allow my legs to tilt back, so my hips\nare shifted back and my new center is above my feet. If you don't believe it, try this trick: stand with\nyour back against a wall, then try to lean forward without falling over. You can't because your automatic\ncorrections are prevented. However, sometimes our \"instinctive\" changes of center of gravity do not com-\npensate correctly. I used to do this one: when up in a \"flying angel,\" and feeling insecure, I would try\nto save myself by putting my arms up above my head and bending my knees. Then I'd fall on my head\nfast, because both these moves shifted my center towards my head.\nThe height of the center of gravity affects stability. The further your center is above your base of\nsupport, the less stable you are. Lying flat on the floor on your stomach, you are extremely stable, having\na low center and huge base of support. Now if you arch your arms and legs up off the floor, you are less\nstable and find it easier to get mobilized. Why? Your base is smaller and your center of gravity further off\nthe floor, both factors making you less stable.\nIn Contact Improvisation, we purposely change center of gravity in order to move. When you are\nrolling on another person, you change your body shape, the center of gravity and point of support change,\nand you move - not because you have pushed or pulled yourself {and if you do it slowly, not by imparting\nmomentum to your body), but simply by shifting center of gravity and allowing gravity to do the rest.\nWhen your center is no longer above the support, your whole body starts to move. This way of initiating\nmovement looks and feels very different from grabbing and pulling. I think a lot of the visual and tactile\nthrill of Contact comes from support and movement that is non-grabby, non-invasive. Shifts in the center\nof gravity of the person supported and shifts in support by the bearer lead naturally to mutual, shared motion.\nIn many situations, the idea of center of gravity alone is not enough for analyzing the mechanics.\nWhen there is more than one point of contact, the center of gravity no longer has to be over a point of\ncontact. One easy example is a person standing on two feet equally; then the center is directly over a spot\nbetween the two feet. Not bad. But if the person is leaning hard against something, the situation isn't\neven symmetrical. You have to consider not only the two forces we've thought about so far (gravity and\nthe resistance of the floor), but all the other forces, acting at angles to one another, and how they tend to\npush and pull and turn the body.\nWhen a body is moving, the physics gets complicated fast. As long as a person is static or moving\nso slowly that momentum is small, the center of gravity tells a lot. However, in analyzing real movement\nphysically, you have to consider momentum, acceleration, angular momentum from whole-body turning\nand from turning at joints, and so on. For vivid examples of bodies in motion, look at pictures of Contact\nImprovisation. Your eye immediately tells you whether a person was probably in motion, or whether\ns/he could be stable in a particular pose. Your well-educated intuition fills in the blanks of where the\nbody must be moving to, what momentum it must have had to get to such a position.\nOne application of the center of gravity concept to a fast-moving body is quite useful, though -\nthat's when the body is in air. During a free jump, there are no outside forces on your body once you\nleave the ground. As you go up, travel through space, and come down, your center of gravity describes\na parabola, no matter what your arms, legs and head are doing. At the top of that arc is where you have\nminimum velocity (none up or down for an instant, but some in a forward direction maybe). Minimum\nvelocity means minimum momentum (momentum= mass x velocity), so that's the time it is easiest for\nsomeone else to receive your body with least impact. If the other person then allows you to nearly follow\nthe curve you were on, the motions look smooth and little force is required, little impact is experienced.\nThis physics is all very interesting, but does it do anything for our dancing? Rarely, I'd say -\nmostly in learning and practicing skills. For me, the physicist's view of center of gravity is quite intellectual;\nI don't sense directly where my center of gravity is. I sense some results of where it is, as the pressures on\nmy feet as my weight shifts around, and other sensations. ---\nWhat happens in dance does follow the laws of physics, but to view Contact Improvisation as\nsimply physics - or worse, to experience it as simply physics - is not my aim. Despite this long article,\nI am wary of thinking and talking too reductionistically. I certainly don't want to contribute to making\nContact an abstract form that is only about physics and not about humans. Contact is about communication\nand sharing, and one element we share is playing with the consequences of physical laws.\n**FOOTNOTE\nI used a standard but tedious way of finding the body's center of gravity from the maso; of each segment\nand its location (see Wells and Luttgens, Kinesiology, 1976, pp 270-275).\n1) I located the center for each joint (dots in my tracing).\n2) I joined the dots and used \"well-known proportions\" (other people's data) to find the center of mass\nof each segment; for example, the center of mass of the thigh is supposed to be 33% of the distance\nfrom the hip to the knee. (X's in tracing.)\n3) Taking an arbitrary point as reference, I found the distance of each segment's center of mass from that\npoint, measured as 'x' and 'y' coordinates.\n4) Not having the actual masses of the body segments of each person involved, I assumed values from the\nliterature for the percent of body weight in each segment. Although total weight varies a lot, people\ndon't differ too much in how the weight is distributed, so this is reasonably OK.\n5) I multiplied the mass of each segment by its 'x'-coordinate and added these products. Then I multiplied\neach mass by its 'y'-coordinate and added these products. Thus I had the vector (directional} sum of all\nthe masses times their distances. Dividing each sum by the total mass, I got the 'x' and 'y' coordinates\nof the center of gravity. C'3..",

    "Title": "Exercise: Eye Images: Let Your Eyes Go for a Ride in Your Head",
    "Authors": [

    ],
    "Text": "Last night in contact class, Danny Lepkoff said, \"Let your eyes go for a ride\nin your head.\" I imagined this:\nas opposed to this:\nA tiny woman, sitting in my eye sockets watching the scenery pass in front of her.\nOther times I imagine her straining to get out, trying to look up when my head is\nlooking down, or simply reaching far ahead of where I am. If I close my eyes and\nlet her relax deep into my eye sockets, I can imagine her sinking into a soft feather\nmattress, and she becomes heavy and soft herself.\nI am thinking about eyes: how impor~ant they are on so many levels. Frequently\nin contact improvisation we talk about peripheral vision. Often this implies some-\nthing about central vision, its importance so great that we don't even need to empha-\nsize it. In all movement, and even more so in dance, people depend on eyes for bal-\nance, coordination, spatial information, and rhythm. In contact, vision is used\nsomewhat differently than in other llDVement forms in that often, the eyes are \"going\nfor a ride in your head,\" and at the same time, the importance of peripheral vision\nis emphasized. So I will add this to my drawing:\nNow I am imagining two additional tiny women\nwho are very active. As the first woman sits in\nmy head getting a free ride, the second and third\nwomen are stretching and looking around towards the\nsides of my head, up and down and around. Without\nthe latter two women I am restricted to the path\nof vision of the direction of my head, but with them,\nI can relax my eyes while stretching my perception.\nIn other words, the first woman represents sensation\nand the second and third women represent perception\nand attention. Try this: look at something directly\nin front of you. Now relax your eyes but still look at it. Now, without shifting\nthe eyeball, think about whatever is to your right and to your left. In my case, I\nam looking at the typewriter ribbon; now I shift my attention to the bathroom door\non my right and the bookcase on my left. The original looking is as if the first\nwoman were reaching forward. Then it is as if she were relaxing and the other two,\nbecoming active, were stretching to the sides.\nAnother exercise for eyes is really about not-eyes. We did this during the\nVermont Contact Improvisation Conference last August: in duets, one person closes\nher/his eyes and th~ other leads her/him wherever their joint energy takes them.\nWhen I did this tlie ' 1 first thing I realized was that I had to trust Ann, my partner.\nShe ~ my eyes. I could still trust my own sensations but they were limited. I\nfound myself running and hoping that there would be no rocks in my path. My normal\ndefense system operates in part through my eyes.\nDefenses, and all el!X)tions, register in the eyes. A study was done which showed\nthat the pupils of people dilate quickly when they see something they find attract-\nive. On the subway or in a crowded elevator people often avert their eyes in order\nto avoid what can be an aggressive act: looking directly into the eyes of someone\nthey don't know. Dogs and cats do the same thing. (I always find it easy to out-\nstare my dog. It seems as if he feels it is very aggressive when I look into his\neyes for too long a time.)\nTo use the word eyes is not quite accurate.\nmove the eyeballs in their sockets. What I have\nthe process of vision and part the \"kinesthetic\nThere are seven muscles which\nbeen discussing is actually part\nconsciousness\" (Mabel Elsworth\nTodd, The Thinking Body, 1937). Todd wrote:\nWe are able to say that a table is four feet away or a piano\nten feet, not, as one might suppose, because of any special\nquality of vision or a specific reaction to light, but chiefly\nby means of the muscular sense. The ability to differentiate\ndistances is built up from a multitude of impressions conveyed\nfrom the eye muscles used in focusing the visual image upon the\nretina •••• Impressions of the work done by the eye muscles as\nthey move are reported to the brain, where they are interpreted\nas indicating a certain distance in space. This interpretation\nin turn is effected through an association of ideas or memories\nof various cumulative experiences, muscular and tactile, and\nof visual impressions of color and size. This is due to memories\nof former experiences - movements of the eye, movements of the\nbody in going towards objects and reaching them, together with\ntactile impressions of their shapes, extent and textures derived\nfrom handling them ••• Similar associations of ideas also aided\nby the labyrinthine sensations reporting the position of our\nhe~ds in relation to the earth, enable us to perceive an object\nin its actual position, right side up, although the retina receives\nan image that is upside down as projected through the anterior\nrefracting surfaces and media of the eye. pp. 31-32.\nLately in my contact work I have been experimenting with relaxing my eyes,\nespecially when I am upside down. At first I feel disoriented. This is because\n\"when an attempt is made to keep the eyes directed so as to move with the head in-\nstead of against it, the primary reflexes have to be interrupted, which at once\nbrings a sense of strain and tension\" (Todd, p.103). It is this sense of strain\nand tension that I am trying to release. Howeuer, without the labyrinthine balance\nmechanism I would not know, after I have flown up and over someone's shoulders,\nwhich way is up and which is down.\nThe eyes are part of the kinesthetic consciousness that we, as contact dancers,\nhope to perceive and sense fully. Different images or fantasies about what is going\non in the eyes can help us to think differently about their activity and help to\nchange that activity. Some exercises:\n\"Start the head nodding gently like a toy (the kind of dog you see in the back\nwindshields of cars). While rocking the head as a delicately balanced weight, note\nhow the eyes m:Jve automatically against the direction of the head and how their\nvision is kept focused on the horizon.\" (Todd, p.103).\n\"Lay a tape on· tihe ground for a guide, then with an opera glass or field\nglass look down at your feet through the large end, and see how straight you can\nwalk. You will find it very hard to keep on the tape so long as you keep looking\nat your feet through the glasses.\" (Todd, p.115).\nDraw a squiggly line on paper. Place mirrors on the vertical sides of the\ninside of a small cardboard box and place the paper inside. Looking only in the\nmirrors and not directly at your hand, try to trace the line. (This exercise I\nremember from a high school fair.)\nRub your hands quickly together until they are very warm. Cup the hands and\nplace over the eyes.\nSpinning: start slowly. One foot turns out, the next parallel. Turn out,\nturn parallel, repeat. Begin w~ile hands are in front of you, held together,\nelbows bent. As the momentum begins to build let your arms slowly release and they\nwill extend to the side. Your eyes rest in your head, unfocused, although they\nwill try, from time to time, to fix on something. If they do you will notice you\nbecome dizzy very quickly. Also, any sudden change, like bending your arms quick-\nly, will result in dizziness·. Come to a stop very gradually the way you began.\nFocus on your hands as they come together. (It is a good idea to have a friend\nstand near you in case of sudden dizziness. The friend should, if s/he sees that\nyou are starting to lose your center, extend her/his arm and continue walking in\na circle with you until you are alright.) With this technique of nonspotted spin-\nning I spun for 45 minutes for the first time recently. Among my other discoveries\nI realized that I can let my eyes remain unfocused while I move for a long time.\nCopyright October, 1977\nEllen Elias",

Some fundamental views it contains: all forms are constantly changing,\nall forms participate as parts of larger forms, and nature tends to equilibrium.\nParticipation in Contact lmprov is a study of movement through aware-\nness and a study of awareness through movement. It provides a joyous\nmeeting ground for moving bodies in spontaneous, genuine, un-self -conscious\nflow as parts of a larger whole: two movers, one duet.\nTo an unaccustomed eye this activity smacks of rough-housing, love-\nmaking, wrestling or martial arts. ·Actually participants learn to move together\non a common path of least resistance in which impulses, weight and momen-\ntum are communicated through a point of physical contact that continually\nrolls around their bodies. Like bolos, fluid and · eccentrically weighted, the\nmoving bodies swing, bounce, roll, swim and fly around with a common center\nof gravity. These skills are developed in non-competitive classes through\nrelaxation and patient physical discipline, in direct association with other movers.",

    "Text": "Human body moves, steps into the stream of information, absorbs change, and\ngrows to become the body of knowledge.\nInformation is gathered, invented, codified, organized by finders of form. In\nform, at ion-level and all the way out towards all universe, units of fact are dis-\ncovered in their arrangement, pattern, shape. Muscles structures, skeletal mech-\nanics, nerve-sensations are examples of existing phenomena which can be perceived\nby mind and feeling, about which humans articulate language so that a system emerges,\na matrix of facts that can be studied, increased, modified, transmitted.\nDynamic information flow is the learning situation. It exists as soon as a\nhuman recognizes a capacity to know about something and feels the need/desire to\nexercise that capacity. All learning begins with the learner.\nIn Contact Improvisation what the learner learns is her/his own body, going\nto the body as the source of knowledge and delivering to the body all the informa-\ntion gathered. Humans who learn often begin to share their bodies with other humans;\nallow their flesh, brain, and imagination to be a pathway through which information\nmay flow; such humans when they are in condition of being employed by learners as\nresource are called teachers.\nTeachers, given ego-logical structures as part of human nature, can and do\nseek learners, can and do make mistakes, can be and often are astonished by what\nthey learn.\nContact Improvisation, the form as teacher, teaches us to follow the mutual\nenergy pathway and to avoid follower/leader patterns. Some human persons have had\nspeculations about how to teach the form; some wonder whether it can be taught.\nThere hovers some difficulty in semantics, having to do with the idea that Contact\nImp is a special sort of form, that it is not a system, like tennis, with rules of\nplay; perhaps Contact Imp is more like an attitude, and being a contactor is like\nbeing an American, or a Buddhist, or a poet.\nWhat about the duet, the round robin, the 58? What about the meditations, the\nsmall dance, the leaps and falls? Aren't they knowledge? Can't they be learnt?\nCan't they be taught?\nCertainly they are, and can be. Just because a river is full of ever-changing\nWater does not mean a human can't learn the river: the pools remain pools, the\nrapids occur wherever the rocks are just so. Just so, the arm and the leg support\nweight in a fairly predictable way, and the person attached can learn to use them\nto accomplish acts -- sharpening the pencil, paddling the canoe, balancing on the\npartner's back and falling off unharmed.\nThe teacher, by the permission of learners, seeks to form a shape out of units --\nexercises, moods, images, ideas -- so that the learner can find a clear way to ap-\nproach, to find body. Often the teacher represents the body of knowledge by putting\na shoulder to the wheeling learner, articulating events directly in flesh-language.\nOften the teacher uses word-language as well to address the mind, imagination, feel-\nings; to guide attention, to help the process of self-discovery. Observation, ques-\ntion/answer, repetition, analysis, experiment are some of the shapes information\nflow takes -- just as water can be found in waves, ripples, eddies, raindrops, and\ncocktails and sti).Dbe water -- and these shapes can be devices to facilitate\nlearning.\nCertainly Contact Improvisation, since it is a form, can be learnt, and any-\nthing that can be learnt also can be taught. To say otherwise is to begin playing\nwith language -- a fascinating and valuable activity, and a device of information\nitself. In discussion about the form it will be wise always to avoid confusion in\nmixing levels of discourse, to avoid being unclear as to whether one is speaking of\nthe physical or the metaphysical counterbalance; the classroom moment or the class-\nification of moments; of momentum as applied to spinning, as applied to planetary\norbits, as applied to non-applied sub-atomic physics theory. There has always been\na care to keep language precis.e and spare in regard to Contact Improvisation, and\nthat care is part of learning the form.\nA minimalization of effort, the efficiency of movement which is grace, is es-\nsential to the form of Contact. It is that grace the teacher helps the learner\nlook for, stepping together into the flow, moving with it, playing in it, working\nthrough_ it, towards the simultaneity of human body and body of knowledge, growing\nto be the body of light.",

So the discomfort is to be appreciated.\nIt is an environment from which springs an opening. Contact embraces this\nfear of itself. this seminal verge.\nWe are concerned with where the dancing originates. At times it\nappears to me that the important thing is not the dancing in the center of the\ncircle. but the experience on the edge of the circle, the often disquieting\ndance on the verge. This view, which might be seen as antithetical to the\nwork. is also necessarily part of its premise. The invitation to feel the dread of\nopening is an inherent part of the total occurrence.\nDances in which both bodies ride a shared wave of truly unleashed\nrise and falling are rare. Yet the dances which abound - halting, starting\nrepeatedly, responding to impulses a fraction of a second too slow to flow,\ndoubting one's perceptions - are rich with valuable information, honest\nmanifestation of fluctuation between positive and negative response. We\nfear surrender. make our homes in the almost, and venture into readiness\nonly when we must. The discomfort at the verge serves by intensifying the\ncontrast: the darks get darker, the lights lighter, and the picture gets easier\nto see.\nI value this work not only for the rare glimpses of in-touch, in-time,\nin-tune. but for the companionship of the ever-present indications of what is\npossible.

By\nlooking at \"what we know\" we approach the fas-\ncinating places of \"the unknown\". Historically,\nContact Improvisation began with everything un-\nknown and in the recent handful of years, a body\nof knowledge, perhaps a grammar of words and\nmotions, has been evolving.

People from\nall walks of life have attempted to describe, ana-\nlyze, teach Contact in terms of their own vocab-\nularies, which range from the scientifically\nspare to the wildly rhapsodic. Meeting changes\nand development within the practice of the form\nand colliding, assimilating, and crossing with\nwords from other contexts, the language of Con-\ntact Improvisation attempts to stay clear, direct,\nand as immediate as the movement itself.\nThe very obvious and the very subtle are al-\nways present in any utterance, pose, or figura-\ntion. Understanding the shapes and shades of\nmeaning and of momentum is as easy and as dif -\nficult as understanding music or the weather.\nEmbodying a concept may or may not use words\nbefore, during, and/ or after; when we seek\ndiscourse, the universe of words enters the pic-\nture. While a woman rolls in a wavelike motion\nacross the floor, another woman waves to her,\nwaving her hand. - (Homonym phenomenon.)\nDuring \"the stand\", a condition of vertical\nrest, in which the skeleton is balanced so the\nmuscles don't have to work to hold the body up,\nsmall adjustments and rebalancings were noted\nto go on involuntarily. When the accumulating\njiggles and twitches were seen to be a continuity,\nthere had to be something to call it, and it is\n\"the small dance\". This happened in the old days.\nAlso in the old days, so many experimental move-\nments were attempted that they were. given num-\nbers. These days the only one that is called by\nits number is \"the 58\". \"58\" is a vault pivoting\noff the partner's thighs, around hip-to-hip, rol-\nling over an arc across the partner's back, fi-\nnally rolling off into the air or someplace else.\nInflux and innovation occur in oi.tr lingo through\nborrowings like aikido rolls, t' ai chi stepping;\nforward rolls; from physics and metaphysics we\nadapt and adopt referent points like counterbal-\nance, chakra, yoga asanas, field .energies, ma.g-\nnetism. Innovative word-invention can produce\nterms immediately understandable, for example,\nSimone Forti's use of \"artsport\" soon swept the\nContact village and one feels again how perfect\na word it is coming upon the ungainly \"sportart\"\nin a newspaper clipping. Other terms like \"blotto\ndance\" never quite caught on. \"Finger ouija\"\nmay or may not be current.\nObviously Contact's language functions among\npractitioners-only groups, and in mixed groups\nwhich include non-contactors. In the former case,\nassumptions are frequently taken for granted,\nbased on common experience. Just as you can\ntell at once if your partner is really in kinetic\ndialogue with you, when verbal conversation flows\nthe words are subsidiary to the moment, suppor--\ntive of the meaning. In the case of the latter,\noften contactors find ourselves making wild anal-\nogies with rock-climbing or talus-running (which\nwe may not have done a whole lot of ourselves),\ntrying to clarify concepts without having to de-\nmonstrate at cocktails just what a 58 is. When\nwe are faced with a reporter, our mother, a\ndance teacher, a baseball fan, or a child who\nsees us doing it in the park, what words do we\ncall up? At the best of these moments the prin-\nciples that live within our process emerge mo-\nmentarily, and some of the phrases stay around.\nRepeating definitions, describing the same mo-\nment several times, feeding our words and ges-\ntures into the common experience keeps refining\nand redefining and refinding the same· old gravity\nand change.",

    "Text": "There is beauty in standing relaxed, allowing body sways to occur and be cor-\nrected, doing 'the small dance'. For me, the beauty of the small dance is not only\nin feeling it, but also in its biology. \"Imperfections\" like swaying are necessities\nof life; deviations and corrections happen on all levels from molecules to evolution.\nBy giving some details about the physiology of standing, I can convey these ideas\nmore concretely.\nIf one knee starts to bend a little\nwhile you are standing, that bending\nstretches the muscle in the front of the\nleg above the knee (the quadriceps).(Fig. 1)\nInside this hunk of muscle there are a few\nhundred thousand individual muscle cells\nand a smaller number of specialized stretch\nreceptors, as seen in the close-up in\nFigure 2A. Because your knee has just\nbent, the stretch receptors are pulled\nalong with the rest of the muscle. Stretch-\ning excites the sensory nerve cells of\nthese receptors so that they send a burst\nof tiny electrical impulses along their\nown lengths to the spinal cord. Inside\nthe spinal cord, sensory nerve cells make\ncontact with other nerve cells at synapses,\nso they can transmit their 11essages. The\nnerve from the stretch receptor makes\na synapse on a motor nerve that excites muscle\ncells back in the quadriceps. (Figure\n2B)\nThis connection of two nerve cells has\nan immediate and interesting result. The\nstretching of the stretch receptor causes\nit to conduct impulses into the spinal\ncord (Figure 3). When these impulses reach\nthe synapse, a chemical is released that\nexcites the motor nerve so it also fires\nimpulses, and these go out of the spinal\ncord to the muscle and excite it to contract.\n(Muscles normally only contract when nerves\nfrom the central nervous system tell them to.)\nThe muscle contracting straightens\nthe knee back up. This whole trip takes only\na fraction of a second to happen;\nit takes a lot longer to explain. (Figure 4)\nThe stretch reflex is a dandy mechanism for keeping standing without thinking\nabout it, since all this action is at the spinal level, below consciousness (which\nresides in the brain somewhere). But in telling about it, I have ignored important\nparts of the system: the links to awareness and the controls on the reflex.\nAwareness of the knee moving happens\nas a result of impulses travelling on\nnerve cells up to the brain. The stretch\nreceptor nerves extend branches up through\nthe spinal cord to parts of the brain,\nto carry information about muscles\nstretch (Fig. 5) Also, there are other\nnerves coming from tendons, joints, con-\nnective tissue, and skin that send mes-\nsages concerning stretch, degree of\nbending, pressure, pain, etc. Some-\nwhere up in the brain this informa-\ntion can reach awareness, but it does\nnot have to. Whether you are aware of\nit or not, the sensory information from\nmany sources is being integrated in the\nbrain to aid in balancing. An interest-\ning way to explore what types of infor-\nmation are being used is to stand on\none foot and check how much your body\nsways. Then close your eyes. Then try\nit with your head tilted (so the grav-\nity/balance receptors in your inner ear\nare affected), with eyes open and closed.\nDoes tensing your leg and body make it\nharder or easier? (I bet no one has ex-\nplored this aspect scientifically. There\nare a zillion simple questions unanswered\nin this field.)\nControl of the stretch reflex is neces-\nsary so that we can move. For standing,\nyour brain \"sets\" the stretch reflexes in\ncertain muscles to hold an erect body position, and once set, the reflexes take care\nof themselves. Then in order to walk or to fall, you inhibit the stretch reflex to\nallow the knee to bend. Awareness and control must be interconnected, as we can\nuse the information about stretch or bend to inhibit the reflex at just the right\nmoment to start a walk.\nThe beauty of swaying and feedback\nThe stretch reflex is called a feedback system because the information about\nhow long the muscle is (how much it has been stretched) is \"fed back\" through the\nspinal cord to the muscle contractors or relaxors, to stay the same length. The\nalternative to feedback is brute force. A statue doesn't fall over, even in a\nfierce wind, because it is exceedingly strong. We are relatively frail, yet we\ncan stand in the wind, using feedback to check our tilting and to govern our muscles.\nAs another example of the brute force method, I was talking to a ballet dancer\nabout the beauty of body sway and feedback. He said, \"But I can stand perfectly\nstill,\" and he proceeded ta stand quit:e (not; perfectly) still. He was tensing sets\nof opposing muscles, being fairly rigid, and swaying very little. I'd call that\nmodified by brute force. He was in fact using some feedback and some rigidity, or\nyou could call it a \"tight\" feedback system with little tolerance of deviation.\nIt is necessary for the body to sway if it is to use feedback. The deviations\nand \"failings\" arouse mechanisms that take you back toward center. You can try to\nget yourself exactly right, dead center, by brute force. Or you can allow deviations\nto happen and be corrected. From a biological viewpoint, it's the same w~th popula-\ntions as with standing: if there were one perfect person for all conditions, we\nshould all have the same body type, skin color, vitamin requirements, and so forth.\nAs it is, the variations have enabled us as a population to survive because we have\nthe diversity to adapt in the long term.\nUsing feedback takes less energy. Doing the small dance, one can relax muscles\nmost of the time, with just a tug here and a twitch there to keep the whole pile of\nbones upright. Contrast this relaxed state to the more exact but more energy-consum-\ning task of trying to stand without swaying.\nFeedback can be used to guide movements as well as in stillness. As you open\nyour front door, you are following a pattern of movements. That pattern is probably\ngenerated in the basal ganglia of the brain and sent down the nerves of the spinal\ncord. The nerves and reflexes of the spinal cord carry out the brain's orders, at the\nsame time using feedback to correct for little problems like sticky doorknobs. (See\nthe Merton article in the bibliography for more on this idea.)\nThe beauties of feedback are many: the mechanism is adaptable (e.g., to high winds\nor tired muscles); deviations don't matter; and the system consumes little energy\nfor its task. But by definition, feedback is used for goal-oriented behavior,\nwhether the goal is standing still, or execution of precise movements like typing.\nIn Contact, we continually use feedback very sensitively, and we transcend it.\nContact is different from other forms of dance in not having long-term goals. In\nother dancing, feedback is used to get the movements correct in a certain form. In\nContact we use feedback from moment to moment to compensate for unexpected weight, to\nbalance, to walk, etc., but not to achieve a correct external form. I think the sen-\nsory information gets used in fundamentally different ways, since it's not needed\nfor \"correctness\". We use messages from the senses to catalyse change rather than\nto stick to a goal.\n\"Even standing you execute a continual fall.\" -Steve Paxton",

    "Text": "Welcome. Yes; you're in the right place. The Contact Newsletter has moved on to become the\nContact Quarterly - a publication put out voluntarily by Free Association four times a year (seasonally).\nFree Association isn't an official name for those of us behind the Quarterly, but a term that catches the\nspirit of our collaboration. Our personnel shifts with each issue depending on (1) which coast is hosting the\nproduction, and (2) the availability and interest of local contacters for work on the production.\nOur common center is a working and experiential knowledge of Contact Improvisation. So far,\neveryone who has 'freely associated' on any of the Newsletter/Quarterly publications has had some exper-\nience with this new, now almost five-year-old, dance-movement-meditation-art-sport-event-piece. On that\nbasic ground we 'stand', and from that stand we swing out - into our overlapping worlds to collect material\nand enthusiasm to channel back through the center and out as far as it travels. Arriving safely and with news.\nContact is interface. And though there are only certain faces you've seen before, there are many\nmore where they came from. Parallel transparencies. Two people inventing electricity within days of each\nother on opposite sides of the globe. Coincidence? Yes, Co-Incidence. And in a likewise but less dramatic\nmanner, we find more of each other every day.\nContact Improvisation has the unique quality of being believed - whether admired, respected,\nscorned, berated, inflated or ignored. Yes real time. Yes real bodies. Yes real people. This particular\ncredibility allows Contact Improvisation and those involved in it, to run tangent to many worlds - relating\ndeeply in to those worlds without either becoming distracted or dilute. In fact, the communication which we\ncontinue to develop among ourselves and articulate in our dancing serves us well outside our immediate\nnumbers. It is what creates our access to the unfamiliar faces, the rapidly surfacing and the as-yet unsurfaced\nnumbers of people who are working with the material of their lives in just such a direct manner as we attempt\nin our teaching, performing and writing of Contact Improvisation.\nWe 'stand' together at the ring of a watering hole; our weight brings the water up, our bodies,\nthe weight down.\nSo, that's where we come from. And here is where we are.",

    "Text": "Just saw the Winter '79 issue of\nCQ and it looks really good! I see\nthat the next issue is on healing ...\na very important topic on many\nlevels ... If anything comes out of\nthe discussion it will be an awareness\nof the connectedness of all things,\nand an affirmation of Contact as a\nconnector.\nIf I may ramble on a bit longer\nand share some insights and a view-\npoint ... It seems the pop'lllar notion\nof 'health' today is a state of 'not\nbeing sick'. Healthy, however, means\n'to be whole'' and is linked to the\nwords \"holy\" and \"beauty\" (the\nGreek word for health is \"koilo\"\nmeaning beautiful). An unhealthy\nperson is damaged, not whole. A\nholy person is a whole being. So,\nthe meaning of health expands be-\nyond the physical aspect. Being\nhealthy involves the dynamic integra-\ntion of body, mind and soul in a pro-\ncess of creative self-expression ... we\nare healthy to the degree that we are\nmanifesting our possibilities.\nOur culture seems to be overly ra-\ntional and intellectual-separating\nmind and body. I know, for example,\nthat most architects live in their\nheads and experience with their eyes.\nThey're very tight and far from spon-\ntant0us (if I may generalize that\ngrossly). Contact Improvisation en-\ncourages integration within the self.\nIt asks for looseness, openness and re-\nsponsiveness ... as well as .a sensitivity\nto one's own needs and those of\nothers ... making one like moldable\nclay-impressionable, sensitive, tan-\ngible ... pulled, thrown, melted, so-\nlidified, broken and pulled together-\nso much physical activity that one\ncannot help but change on the emo-\ntional, mental, and spiritual levels as\nwell. With this awareness we can en-\ncourage a healthy cross-linking of all\nthe levels ... toward a wholeness of\nb.eing ... The environment surround-\ning us can be a 'stage for life' ... sup-\nporting 'wholeness'. A healthy en-\nvironment nurtures healthy people;\nhealthy people build healthy environ-\nmen ts.\nWith this spirit,\nNamaste!\n\n\n\nMpls, Minnesota\nDear Contact Quarterly,\nComing from a background of\npsychology and movement therapy,\nI am intrigued by the similarities be-\ntween what I have experienced in\nContact Improvisation and my exper-\nience in psychological therapies. The\nfollowing is a brief synopsis of the\npsychological theories I have looked\nat in this way.\nGestalt Therapy-focuses on \"being\nin the now.\" By paying attention to\nour inner needs in each moment, we\nrelinquish the avoidances in our lives\nand commit ourselves to confronting,\nand living in the present.\nJungian Approach to Therapy-\nbased on Carl Jung's belief in the ex-\nistence of the feminine and masculine\nin each of us regardless of our gender.\nThe essence of the work in Jungian\ntherapy is to balance out, and come\nto a resolution of the imbalanced or\nconflicted opposites within us.\nVarious theories of Group Dyna-\nmics-predictable behavior patterns\ninherent in the development of a\ngroup which evolve out of the unfold-\ning of contact and intimacy amongst\nthe members of a group.\nTheme of rejection-a common de-\nnominator to most therapies. Based\non denial of a human being's primary\nneed for love and acceptance, usually\ngoing back to one's early relation-\nship with parents. The building of\ntrusting and honest relationships is\na key factor in any mode of therapy\nto help counteract feelings of un-\nworthiness, and the fear of rejection.\nSome thoughts: I am wondering\nif more attention should be paid to\nContact Improvisation as a healing\nart by bringing psychological con-\nsciousness to Contact classes, jams,\nand workshops? And if so, how do\nwe do this? (Also, has it been, or is\nit presently being done by anyone?)\nWill doing this change Contact Im-\nprovisation from an educational to a\npsychological process, and if so, do\nwe want to do this?\nSo, to sum up, can (and how can)\nan exploration of psychological\ntheories and techniques shed some\nlight on to the psychological frame-\nwork within Contact Improvisation\nin order to open up greater potenti-\nality for the teaching and dancing\nexperience of Contact Improvisation?\nWould love to have an exchange\nof ideas on this by contacters who\nhave experience and expertise within\nthe field of psychology.\nToward growth and wholeness,\n\nGreenfield, Mass.",

    "Text": "Contact improvisation is a move-\nment technique. Though much young-\ner than ballet or modern dance, it\nproves to be as rich and dee~. It ei_n-\nbodies a progression of physical skills\nwhich can be used to train the begin-\nner as well as challenge the virtuoso.\nStudents of contact improvisation\nacquire access to a large realm of\nmovement very quickly and begm to\nmake significant changes in their\nmovement patterns, strength, and sen-\nsitivity within three or four classes.\nThis makes the technique particularly\ndesirable for the theater student and\nnon-dancer.\nThe skills acquired in contact im-\nprovisation are by no means limited\nto the form itself. A deep understand-\ning of weight, movement flow, and use\nof strength greatly aid anybody who\ndesires to study ballet, modern dance,\nor other physical disciplines. The ex-\ntensive exposure to the physical and\nmental states involved in improvising\nand discovering movement can help\nchoreographers in their attempts to\ngather material for their set work.\nContact improvisation directly\nstrengthens one's presence. Just as\none can become aware of the eyes\nseeing, the ears hearing, and the skin\nfeeling, one can become aware of the\nmind sensing. Through practice of\nthis dance form one becomes able to\nexperience and observe the state of\none's nervous system particularly\nwhen in an intimate physical relation-\nship with another. This spawns an\nelement of control over one's percep-\ntual reality. This control and ability\nto focus is training in developing pow-\ner. Personal power and strength of\npresence is essential in any performing\nsituation as well as in daily life.\nContact improvisation nurtures a\nbasic physical trust between two\npeople and among a group. The form\ndemands a care and consideration of\none's partner and towards this end\nseeks to develop sensitivity and con-\nfidence. This trust and the freedom\nwhich ensues kindles a rich and fertile\nenvironment for working creatively\nwith another person. Knowledge and\nexperience of this environment aids\nin any situation where people are\nworking together, actors on stage\ndoing a scene, or dancers performing\na piece.\nThe working relationships which\ndevelop in this form cross the bound-\naries created by sexual roles; men\ndance with men, women with women,\nand men with women alike. I do not\nknow of anv artistic discipline in\nwhich non-~exual, deep, and honest\nphysical contact is explored with_ to-\ntal equality relative to sex. In this\nform women lift men as often as men\nlift women. Women learn to exercise\na kind of strength which often has\nnever been encouraged, likewise men\nlearn to allow themselves a soft, re-\nsponsive, and non-competitive posture.\nIt is a revelation to both partners that\na one hundred and eighty pound man\ncan be easily & completely supported\nby a one hundred pound woman.\nAgain, the trust derived from freeing\nthe traditional sexual roles creates a\nmore comfortable and fluid atmos-\nphere among any group of artists\nseeking to work together.\nContact improvisation seems to be\nof particular value for the college age\nperson. College students find them-\nselves in an intense period of transi-\ntion. They are coming to grips with\nthe image and reality of themselves\nas adults. Thev are intently exploring\nthe psychological politics of sexual\nrelationships. This form offers them\na grounded, simple, and clear oppor-\ntunity to interact deeply and honestly\nwith each other. It seems to serve as\na reference point or forum for expe-\nriencing oneself in relationship with\nothers in an unthreatening environ-\nment and without the need to formu-\nlate consciouslv or to talk about what\nis going on. The strongest evidence\nfor the emotional supportive value of\nthis work is the very real attraction\nstudents have for this form. They\nwant to experiment and expand. This\nform gives them the opportunity to\ngo ahead.\nIn and of itself contact improvisa-\ntion has become a significant move-\nment within the dance world, recog-\nnized bv audiences and critics as a\nfascinating and evocative performance\nexperience. Many up and coming\ndancers and actors are using the skills\nthey've acquired through practice of\nthis form to advance themselves in\ntheir artistic work. Considering its\nvalue as a supportive discipline for\nthe actor studying theater or the danc-\ner studying traditional techniques, as\nwell as its presence as a new and viable\ndance form, I feel no hesitation in\nrecommending to any college or uni-\nversity that contact improvisation be\na permanent part of the curriculum of\nany program in dance or theater. ~",

    "Text": "Ellen: We're discussing the business\nof Contact-How to be a business\nmanager or how not to be. What are\nthe primary ingredients in putting on\na performance? We came up with: a\nmailing list, space (size and location),\nscheduling, organizing. Are you doing\nit for a friend or, as Dena called it,\nare you taking a cut? What kind of\nexpectations did you have as the or-\nganizer? Were they shared by the\nperformer?\nPeter: I think that as a promoter you\nhave to maintain your integrity. The\nfact is that we are part of the Contact\ncommunity that stretches from coast\nto coast. There are times when peo-\nple are bringing in someone they know\nonly from reputation. There is a dan-\nger that you may get in over your\nhead. You have to be able to say,\n\"no\" even though you want the work-\nshop to happen, \"I'm sorry, I can't\nguarantee this amount of money or\nthis number of students.\" You must\nbe clear as to what you can generate\nand let the artist make the decision.\nDena: Concerning integrity, there\nhave been inklings and rumblings of\ncompetition for markets, like \"don't\ntouch Oregon, it's mine.\" The Bay\nArea Contact Network in San Fran-\ncisco, initiated bv Alan Ptashek and\nothers [see CQ Vol IV No 3/4] is a\nmodel we can think about in the\nfuture to help us cooperate instead\nof compete. Isn't that the philosophy\nof our dance form?\nEllen: In terms of competition among\nproducers, the four of us mentioned\nthat we hadn't been \"doing it\" lately,\nso someone else is obviously \"doing\nit\" instead.\nDena: The first year that I sponsored\npeople, I did it \"as a gift\", to help my-\nself learn and to support contact in my\ncommunity. I've grown to understand\nthat it is important to take a percent-\nage so that you don't feel that your\nenergy is exploited.\nRoger: I've always thought that man-\nagement is just as much of an art as\nthe dancing.\nEllen: On the East Coast Tour in\n1978, it was suggested that the man-\nagers and the performers all take an\nequal cut. In this instance we were\nseen as equal partners.\nRoger: In actual fact, this arrange··\nment never happened.\nDena: In Montr(al, we've never of-\nfered a guaranteed fee to the perform-\ner because we are not producers and\nhave no money to back the perform-\nance. On the other hand, I've worked\nfor the Muse\"e des beaux-arts de Mon-\ntr~al which can produce the perform-\nance and take the risk of losing money.\nEllen: What we're talking about is\ntwo styles, one where you are the\nmanager and have all the responsibi-\nlity and another where you broker\nthe services of an institution. Clearly\nif you can broker these services it\ntakes the risk, time, and frustration\nout of your hands to some degree. If\nyou're going on your own, the failure\nor success is all yours. The expecta-\ntion of a good performance can be\ncrushed totally when no one shows\nup and there is no money to pay any-\nbody, including yourself.\nPeter: Dena's letter in the Contact\nQuarterly last year requested that\npeople not take it for granted that if\nthey gCJ on tour they're going to be\nable to get sponsors in each city.\nAgain, if you are planning a tour,\nplease be sensitive and respect the\npeople who live there; they rely on\ntheir community for their livelihood.\nSo, if you come in as a high profile\nperformer you are going to milk the\nmarket. If you are on the road a lot\nor want to be on the road a lot, con-\nsider the fact that we are a limited\nmarket. You are placing a great bur-\nden upon your promotor to go be-\nyond his/her neighborhood and dance\ncommunity to generate that extra\nrevenue for you.\nRoger: The easiest way to organize\nsomething is to affiliate yourself with\na local dance studio that does modern\nor experimental work. You can use\ntheir mailing list, studio, facilities,\netc. to piggyback with your own per-\nsonal resources instead of taking on\nall the organizing yourself. A finan-\ncial guideline: if you co-sponsor with\nsomeone (and they provide the post-\nage and mailing, box office and pub-\nlicity) the standard split is 50150.\nOne situation or avenue that has been\nvery successful in New York City is\naffiliation with galleries. The Paula\nCooper Gallery has hosted three sets\nof performances, and the Holly Solo-\nmon Gallery sponsored one. In some\ncases they guarantee the performers\na small fee, but usually they furnish\nonly the space. Donations are re-\nquested.\nPeter: Vancouver is not a visual arts\ncenter, and galleries have not been a\ngood alternative here. ._,.\nDena: In Montr~al, we've worked\nin three settings: Studio Catpoto,\nuniversities, local studios. Luckily\nwe have always had our\"own work\nspace and, given enough time, we can\nfree it up for a week. We usually get\nit for a bargain price since we are the\nmajor renters, say 100 dollars for the\nweek (and free classes for our land-\nlords). Concordia University recently\nhired Andrew Harwood to teach, and\nUniversit€ de Qufbec hired me-and\npaid us on guest teacher salaries. Oc-\ncasionally Studio Nouvelle Aire has\nco-sponsored someone with us.\nPeter: If you can do it, get an insti-\ntution to back you. Look for the\nmuseums, the community colleges,\nlibraries, churches, public buildings\nwith downtown plazas, art councils.\nRoger: It is also important to know\nyour local area and what can and\ncan't be done there. It's one thing\nto organize a workshop for ten peo-\nple with a teacher who is your friend;\nit's another thing to plan a series of\nworkshops, two or three performances\nand guarantee a fee of $500. You\nhave to know beforehand what you're\ngoing to be able to handle.\nDena: Getting very practical, I think\nabout all the expenses. There's the\nairfare, fee for the space, poster de-\nsign and printing, office supplies, post-\nage, telephone, housing and food (in\nMontreal we usually bed and board\nthe artist with us). Sometimes there\nare additional costs such as video,\nlighting equipment, tech personnel.\nEllen: Listening to Dena's list of ex-\npenses and how they are or are not\npaid for, I would describe this process\nas \"grass roots\". If one looks at the\nactual costs to produce a concert, it\ncan be quite expensive. It seems that\nin the Contact community we are re-\nlying much more on volunteer human\nresources, than financial resources.\nDena: I find we're designing a new\nbusiness context. I've also been in-\nvolved with the National Endowment\nfor the Arts touring program, and I\nsee that contacters are working on a\ntotally different basis (day to day sur-\nvival, maybe?)\nPeter: In the winter of 1978, I spon-\nsored Beth Goren and Danny Lepkoff.\nThe workshops were each a week long\nand the fee was $ 50. There were 10\nto 15 people per workshop so there\nwas a healthy amount of money. The\ncosts were not that great because air-\nfare was not included.\nEllen: So out of this gross income of\n$500 how much money did you make\nand how much time did you put in?\nPeter: I put in a lot of time, I did a\nlot of groundwork and I haven't even\nthought about the percentage. I had\na separate bank account for all money\nI made as a sponsor and did not break\nit down for each individual project,\nbut I probably made about$ 75 for\neach, about 20%.\nEllen: One question that comes up in\nterms of percentages is the amount\nyou take as the manager. I've also\ntaken from 10 to 20 percent, depend-\ning on my experience at the time.\nDena: The workshop classes have been\nthe real money-making part of each\nresidency. The performances have\nbrought in a minor amount in every\ncase.\nEllen: Production costs are usually\nhigh compared to performance revenue.\nWhereas in a workshop, the overhead\nis low, the fees are high for the parti-\ncipants, and you're paying only one\nor two teachers.\nDena: The cost is infinitely greater\nfor five people. It's much easier to\ndo a successful duet tour.\nRoger: One of the biggest problems\nhas been finding a suitable space\n(large enough and with resilient floors),\nand then having to pay $ 5 or $10 an\nhour for many hours of classes.\nPeter: Sometimes it's difficult to\nnegotiate a reasonable fee for a week\nof classes. In Vancouver, I've rented\nthe Western Front and made arrange-\nments to cover the cost of the space.\nI included that in the fee for the work-\nshops. We don't work on a percentage\nbasis either.\nDena: In Montreal, we've always\noffered a flat rate for space, not by\nthe hour or by a percentage.\nEllen: Another thing you might con-\nsider, especially if you are in a learn-\ning phase, is bartering. Maybe you\nwant to take the workshops for free\nin exchange for your services. Be clear\nfrom the beginning with yourself and\nthe performer that that's all you want\nout of it. I think you'll find the\namount of time it takes to produce a\nresidency is much greater than you\never think it is.\nDena: At Catpoto, we four (now\nsix) help each other plan residencies,\nthough one person takes the major\nresponsibility (we alternate). We have\na video person, and we all translate\ninto French, in exchange for taking\nthe classes.\nEllen: Keep a clear, accurate record\nof expenses and make out a projected\nbudget of income and expenses. And\ncontracts. I highly recommend con-\ntracts even if you are promoting a\nfriend. It's good business to make\nout a contract signed by both parties\nstating the exact requirements. It's\nnot something you write up when the\nperson arrives, it's something you agree\non beforehand.\nRoger: Before you begin, it's also a\ngood idea to talk with your local\ndance studios and find out what their\nexperience has been in sponsoring\nother artists. You may get some idea\nof how receptive the non-contact com-\nmunity might be.\nDena: Know your community and\nfind out the schedule of other arts\norganizations (even a psychology\nconvention could conflict). Don't\noverlap with other important events.\nEllen: Time is another consideration.\nYou need to accommodate both day\nand evening workers. Planning during\ncollege vacations is not a good idea.\nBut no matter what schedule you\nmake, someone is going to be unavail-\nable or disappointed. Also, think\nabout the location of the space. If\ntransportation is not good or the loca-\ntion is not safe, people who might be\ninterested in the work may not come.\nA high profile place attracts more\nstudents/audiences. How much do\npeople in your area know contact and\nthe particular person you are spon-\nsoring? When Steve Paxton came to\nBoston there was a real interest not\nonly from Contact people but from\npeople who were interested in dance\nin general. Whereas, when Andrew\nHarwood came, although I knew he\nwas a great teacher, no one had ever\nheard of him. People were totally\ngoing on my say-so that this was going\nto be a good class.\nPeter: Essentially, the issue you are\nraising is that of selling the person.\nSome people do not have to be sold,\ntheir names are already commodities.\nDena: Montreal is different because\nthe commodity in the workshops I\nhave sponsored has been Contact\nImprovisation itself, not the reputa-\ntion of the teacher. The large T'ai\nChi community and those interested\nin dance improvisation always come.\nRoger: Boston and New York City\nare much different. The Contact\ncommunity is very small relative to\nthe dance community. So for the\nsponsor it's really a matter of reaching\nout to the public and selling the\nteacher.\nPeter: You have to go beyond the\nContact people to those not regularly\nengaged. For example, when Beth\nGoren came, she did a workshop called\n\"Balancing the Body/Mind\". Now\nAndrew Harwood and Mangrove \\vere\nfollowing on each other's tails. What\nwe thought of, with Mangrove in town\nfor only three days, was to have them\nteach a men's class and tap the gay and\n\"masculinist\" communitv. The Gav\nRights Association beca~e an enth~siastic\nco-sponsor. Those were the\nlargest workshops we've ever had.\nWe've relied mainlv on word-of-mouth\namong the dancer~. other fringe art-\nists, psychologists, and friends of\nfriends of friends. Limited postering\n!n certain cafes ...\nPeter: ~\\y experience is that word-of-\nmouth is not sufficient. In most urban\nareas there is a glut of posters. So if\nyou're going to compete with what\nelse is going on you have to be very\nselective. Phone calls are a good thing\n(D: and patience). Also, getting to the media and selling\nthe person: \"Look, we have this per-\nson coming to town.\" Send the in-\nformation-who the person is, what\nthey have <lone, what they are going\nto offer and whv it would be interest-\ning to have the~ on the air to talk,\npublic service announcements on TV,\netc, are useful as well. If the media\nare tough, I'd really suggest cultivating\nfriends. That means finding out who\nthose people are, letting them know\nwho you are and why you are a good\nperson to know.\nDena: I've gotten to know one local\nreviewer, Angele Dagenais, who I find\nvery open-minded and articulate. She\nwrote one article on Contact the first\nyear I came to the city and people\nstill call us about it. We give it out as\nthe French introduction to the form.\nOne article can have a great deal of\ninfluence.\nEllen: That brings us to deadlines.\nHow much planning time you have\nahead of the performance or work-\nshop is very important to a good pub-\nlicity campaign. You need to get to-\ngether a press packet including a press\nrelease, any material (resume, reviews)\nyou have from the artist, and photos.\nYou'll find nine times out of ten that\nif you have a good action photo with\nsharp contrast, you '11 get your article\npublished, or at least a photo and a\ncaption. Find out the deadlines for\nthose free public listings and service\nannouncements. I relv on free adver-\ntising, and have used few paid ads,\n(though they can be invaluable if you\nhave the budget.)\nRoger: There are· two problems that\ncan't be predicted. One is the failure\nof your publicity campaign. You may\nsend out press releases and no paper\nwill list them. The second is the\nweather ...\nDena: ... and other natural cycles.\nIt seems to be everyone's experience\nthat the enthusiasm within the Con-\ntact community has upswings and\ndownswings. Sometimes they're hard\nto predict.\nEllen: How can you draw a new\nContact aumence and not be so de-\npendent on the same people to sup-\nport you each time? I think you\nhave to consider who else is in town\nat the same time. The timing may\nbe great for you, but if Pilobolus is\nthere that night and that's where\nyour audience is going, it could be a\ndisaster.\nDena: At least three weeks before\nthe event, get your announcements\nin the mail.\nEllen: Build an effective mailing list\nfrom the community where you know\nthe interest exists. For ir1stance, using\nthe list of a ballet company would ob-\nviously not work (it's quite huge and\ntoo time-consuming to sort out). Re-\nmember, bulk mailing is a real money\nsaver. You need 200 pieces in the\nU.S. Find a non-profit organization\nwhose bulk mailing permit you can\nborrow, and mail out 200 no matter\nwh<!t\nDena: At Catpoto, we collected an\nexcellent list of highly interested\nfolks from our own students, the\nguest list from performances we gave,\nand everyone who calls. Each year\nwe sit down and comb out the \"dead\"\ncards.\nPeter: Why doesn't a workshop or\nperformance go? The responsibility\nis on the sponsor to be shrewd enough\nand astute about who is going to\ncome and whether vou can attract\npeople from a dista\"nce. Why not\ninclude in the Quarterly a list of in-\ndividuals and groups who are available\nfor touring that people could write\nto?\nDena: I've found that collaborative\nventures are the clearest way to avoid\npotential time and place collisions.\n",

    ],
    "Text": "Until I wrote this article, I hadn't\nrealized how many different directions\nI've gone with Contact in the past\nyear. All of these experiences are\nunited by one personal goal: I'd like\nto contribute to the development of\nContact as a folk art, a meaningful art\nactivity which ordinary people do for\npure enjoyment in the normal course\nof their lives. I wantto be a dance\nteacher/performer within a community\nof people who may have chosen not to\ndance full-time, but still retain a sense\nof the dancer in themselves. I've been\nreaching out to people who might not\notherwise think of getting into Con-\ntact dancing, even if they should have\nheard of it. I've been contacting:\nwith Seniors ...\nI did a Contact workshop with\nSAGE, a senior citizens group in\nOakland, California. When I arrived\nI was pleasantly surprised to find all\nthe senior citizens and social workers\nlying on the floor of a plushly car-\npeted living room, each with their\nhead on someone else's belly, laughing\nhysterically. Naturally, I immediately\njoined the fun.\nAs I led the group through contact\nexercises, I noticed a nervousness in\nmyself. I feared being out of touch\nwith the stamina and flexibility of\nolder bodies and the degree of risk\nappropriate to older people. The pos-\nsibility of injuries floated up into my\nmind. However, this group responded\nto the same exercises that I use in my\nregular classes with only slight modi-\nfication, and I soon felt at ease. I\nstayed primarily with exercises that\ndid not take the participant very far\noff center, but by the end of the ses-\nsion, we had even gotten into weight\ntaking, and the only person who had\ndropped out was an 83 year old wo-\nman who had recently broken her\nankle.\nAs the two hour session was com-\ning to an end, I found myself doing\nactive-passive duets (I was the active\none) with one person after another.\nEveryone around me began claiming,\n\"I'm next!\" \"I'm next!\" It was fun.\nEvery single person danced a duet\nwith me, even the woman with the\nbroken ankle. These older men and\nwomen let me balance them in the\nair on my hip or back without clutch-\ning or showing any signs of fear. They\nmelted into the floor and took my\nweight with just the right amount of\nactive-passive involvement. I was a-\nmazed-we were really doing contact!\nAt our final hug, everyone was in-\ncredibly high, including myself-des-\npite my sweaty exhaustion. As I left,\nI overheard them saying that they\nwished the experience had been video-\ntaped so that I could be shown at an\nupcoming Senior's conference in the\nMidwest. Gray power is powerful!\nwith the Blind ...\nI also taught a series of classes at\nthe Lighthouse for the Blind this last\nyear. There were six students, some\nwere senior citizens. Within this par-\nticular group of blind people, there\nwere multiple handicaps. Some were\nmentally retarded or psychologically\ndisoriented, some had excessively\ntense, rigid bodies, one was obese, one\nhad a fractured collar bone from a re-\ncent fall, others had arthritis, diabetes\nand other conditions which made them\nshort of breath or easily dizzied.\nI altered my class goals, deciding to\nuse contact as a movement therapy\ntool rather than as an end in itself.\nWe spent about an hour on warm-up\nand relaxation, then spent the last\nhour on contact exercises. Since I\ncouldn't just say \"Do it like this\" and\nthen visually demonstrate the activity,\nI was forced to describe many sensa-\ntions that I experience in Contact with\nprecise language. This was a major\nchallenge for me and I learned a lot\nabout Contact in the process.\nUsing Contact experiences to im-\nprove the student's real-life function-\ning increased my awareness of how\nreally beneficial and healing Contact\nis. I feel incredibly enriched by the\nluxury of my present Contactor's life-\nstyle which includes so much touching,\ntrusting, and ease of movement.\nSince classes at the Lighthouse have\ncome to an end, one of the visually dis-\nabled students (without other impair-\nments) is now attending my regular\nclass where he is much in demand as\na Contact partner among the other\nstudents. ~\nwith Therapists ...\nTeaching workshops for therapists\nwith my sister, Ilene Dillon,-who is a\ntherapist with a private practice in\nMarin County, has also increased my\nvocabulary and awareness of Contact\nas a therapeutic tool. Ilene immedi-\nately recognizes principles of assertion\nat work in the dynamics of Contact\ninterplay. Her theories on manipula-\ntion are amply illustrated in what\nmakes a Contact duet work or not\nwork. It seems that the same laws\nwhich are operating on a physical\nlevel in Contact activities are also op-\nerating on a psychological level in re-\nlationships. Vocabulary used to de-\nscribe emotional realities has a very\nstrong impact when one senses that\nit is also true on a literal level when\none dances Contact, and vice versa.\nBruce Dodson, a member of the\n\"Issues in Radical Therapy\" news-\npaper collective, and I co-led a Con-\ntact session at the Radical Psychiatry\nSummer Institute at Fort Mason this\nyear. Here the language and emphasis\ndiffered slightly from Ilene's, but it\nseemed that Contact also fit in well\nwith the Radical Psychiatry point of\nview. I found it easy to communicate\nthe notion of giving body surface to\nease a falling person's descent (rather\nthan grab them to try to keep them\nfrom harm) to people who were al-\nready familiar with the concepts of\nthe \"rescuer-victim-persecutor\" tri-\nangle (when a person tries to 'help'\nsomeone by 'taking care' of them,\nthey create a victim who will later\nresent\"-persecute] them for it.) In\nother words, the person with the prob-\nlem should have control of solving it.\nMy communal family and I attend-\ned the Summer Institute together. We\nhave started using Radical Psychiatry\ntechniques in our emotional sharing\nmeetings and our personal lives. It\nhas helped us achieve more intimacy\nas a group, and a better clarity in re-\nsolving conflicts. It feels good to sense\nthe harmony between the principles\nused in my family and emotional life\nand in my dancing.\nwith Communes ...\nThe Communal Grapevine, (a net-\nwork of communes in the S.F. East\nBay) invited me to lead a Contact ses-\nsion at their monthly potluck gather-\ning. Over 40 communal houses belong\nto the network.\nIt seemed like all 40 of the house-\nholds were in attendance. The very\nlarge living room of the host commune\nwas filled to the brim with people\nready to experience their first Contact\nsession, and beyond their heads I could\nsee many others pouring in the front\ndoor. This was a greatly diverse group,\nranging from early teens to seniors,\nand encompassing a wide variety of\nlifestyles. For some, it was clear that\nContact teetered on the edge of what\nwas sane and/or respectable behavior.\nBut an \"I'll try anything once\" atti-\ntude prevailed.\nAbout a quarter of the group was\nstill dancing two hours later after\nhungrier companions drifted off to\nsample the temptations of the pot\nluck. By then we were involved in\npretty athletic movement and the de-\ncrease in density gave us room to move\nsafely. At the end, the diners and dan-\ncers re-grouped and discussed values of\ninterdependent, cooperative, trusting,\nand responsible interaction held in\ncommon by Contact Improvisation\nand communal living.\nSeveral communal houses invited\nme to come to their regular house\nmeetings to lead their family in an\nevening of Contact sharing. I accepted.\nFor some houses, this meant the first\nbreaking of an unspoken taboo against\nphysical contact among the house\nmembers, and caused a mixture of an-\nticipatory excitement and apprehen-\nsion. So far I have not heard of any\nresulting orgies fulfilling anybody's\nworst (or best?) fears after indulging\nin the communal contact sessions I\nhave led.\nSome of the communards in the\nEast Bay wanted more Contact than\na one-shot family meeting. At the\ntime, no one was teaching Contact in\nthe East Bay, so I started a class which\nwas held at Berkeley Moving Arts and\nthen later at the Dwight House com-\nmune. It was attended primarily by\nmembers of three communes although\npublicity eventually opened it up to\nothers as well.\n(Historical note: I began teaching\nContact more than two years ago in\nmuch the same series of events. First,\njust a weekly sharing session with my\ncommunal family in our living room.\nThen my family began bringing their\nfriends, the friends brought their\nfriends, and soon I was putting up\nposters and teaching four classes a\nweek in the Walkabout studio in San\nFrancisco.)\nin Community performances ...\nThis summer, a small loose group\nof contactors calling ourselves \"Public\nWorks\" met informally on Sundays\nin Golden Gate Park and performed\noutdoors for the crowds lined up wait-\ning to get into the King Tut exhibition.\nI initiated this project, modeling the\nstructure on a street performance\ngroup of which I was a member five\nyears ago. \"Public Works\" differed\nfrom the earlier group in that we used\nprops rather than white face to pro-\nvoke curiosity and we did Contact\nImprovisation rather than theater.\nWearing construction worker hats\nand bright orange T-shirts, and sur-\nrounded by our props, which included\nroad crew pylons and flags, plus two\nsawhorses stenciled with the \"Public\nWorks\" logo over the bright orange\nstripes, we evoked the image of work-\ners doing street repair. The dancing\nstarted with high energy jumps and\nlifts, and the contact duet movement\nwas amplified with hand-held road\ncrew flags. This was the most effec-\ntive way we found to attract attention\nand gather an audience. \"Public\nWorks\" participants agreed it was an\ninteresting experiment. We plan to\nrevise and recycle it after the rainy\nseason is over.\nThis fall, I've continued my explor-\nation of Contact as a performance\nform with the advanced students in\nmy regular classes. ] oe Dowling,\nRobin Snyder and I recently gave a\nContact demonstration and perform-\nance at the Noe Valley Public Library.\nConditions were difficult: a cold,\nlinoleum covered concrete floor in a\nsmall room with low ceilings. A par-\nty with a live band was going on in\nthe room above us, and our space\nwas the only access route to the build-\ning bathrooms. However, we had a\ncapacity crowd of enthusiastic people\nwho joined us in an hour of Contact\nexperiences, watched our Contact per-\nformance, and then eagerly partici-\npated in the question and answer\nperiod. The physical limitations •\nhad not prevented us from turning\npeople onto Contact.\nThis fall, Charles Campbell and I\nalso did a Contact performance and\ndemo at the Jewish Community Cen-\nter, which included a lively question\nand answer period. People in the\nBay Area are beginning to notice\nthe term \"Contact Improvisation\"\nand are eager to find out what it's\nall about. 'Bo",

    "Text": "Mark Pritchard addressed the con- \ntact community with observations, \ncomments and criticisms in 'New Age \nShuffleboard'. His concerns seem to \nstem from a sense of passivity, self- \nrighteousness and faddism, coupled \nwith a loss of creative integrity in the \ncontact community. Having built my \nlife, if not my lifestyle, on contact \nimprovisation for the last five' years, \nI am interested in his perspective as \na relative newcomer. Is it indication \nof a path of evolution the form has \ntaken? Coincidentally, the latest \nContact Quarterly has reprinted an \narticle Steve Paxton wrote four years \nago. In it he speaks of the mild life- \nto-life confrontation of contact set \nagainst the life-or-death urgency of \naikido: \" ... is it [contact] a cheap \nthrill, placator, builder of influence \nfor those with the sweets, waste of \ntime spent in orgy of sensation?\" \nMark concludes in his article that \n\"contact risks becoming dull, at least, \nand self-righteous and pretentious at \nworst.\" Are these similar concerns? \nIs it a lack of urgency which has \nbrought on passivity and a death of \ncreative outreach?\nFrom my recent experiences at \nhome and abroad I feel there is much \nlife in the contact community but \nthere are more questions than there \nare answers. We seem to be at the \nend of one cycle of seven or eight \nyears of growth, and entering anoth- \ner. The contact form has spanned \nthis continent many times and made \na name for itself in the dance world. \nIt boasts literally dozens of teachers \nand performers and thousands of \npractitioners. What I find particular- \nly lacking are conceptual frameworks \nfor what we are doing as artists and \na corresponding lack of ability to \nhave meaningful creative dialogue as \nperforming artists. In this paper I \nwould like to share my perception of \ncontact improvisation as it relates to \ntwo different performance modes: \nthe behavioral and the relational. In \nso doing I hope I will speak to ;\nlark's \nconcerns by stimulating continued \ndynamism in this \"artsport\".\nContact improvisation is based on \ncertain principles and assumptions. \nMark Pritchard focuses on the sup- \nposed contact hang-up with the term \n\"natural\". I would like to substitute \nthe word \"functional\": contact de- \nrives from functional movement. In \nother words we learn to use our \nbodies in necessary and efficient ways \nin order to relate to our environment \nand a moving partner. It is functional \nto relax while falling because it takes \nless energy and it causes less energy [sic] \nupon impact. It is also functional to \ncatch oneself with the arms because \nthey can break a fall and not jar the \nsystem if the wrists, elbows and shoul- \nders give with the weight. For our \npurposes in dancing it is also function- \nal to roll upon meeting the floor, \ntransferring the direction of the mo- \nmentum from vertical to horizontal \nin order to keep the energy moving. \nTo me the word \"functional\" helps \nbypass the confusion over a nebulous \nword like \"natural\". Being functional \nas a principle of moving is integral to \ncontact for safety, speed and ease. In \nthe world of nature it is often said \nthat form follows function. In contact \nthe \"natural\" elegance of the pure \nform could be seen in the same way: \none watches the everchanging forms \nof the human body as it falls, supports, \njumps, catches, lifts and follows an- \nother body. This quality of function- \nal grace is shared with most sports, \nand it is herein lies the connection be- \ntween contact and nature. -+\nHowever, the questions of aesthe- \ntics and creativity still remain.

With \"func-\ntional\" physical interaction basically\n\"informing\" the dancing, the creative\ninterplay arises from mutual awareness\nof weight, rhythm, momentum, en-\nvironment, attitude and feeling. It is\nat this level of awareness, and not the\nlevel of functional form, that aesthetics\nemerge. Sharing a physical vocabulary\nof contact improvisation does not\nguarantee a shared aesthetic, especial-\nly performance attitude. This was\nclearly demonstrated for the audience\nin a duet performance which I did\nwith Nancy Stark Smith at the Con-\nference. Contact gave us a way to\nbring together two different histories\nand styles of performance-a creative\ninterplay. Let's now look at these\ntwo aesthetics. I remind you that\nthese are my observations and may\nnot relate to how others define these\napproaches. Especially those dancing\nthem.\n* * *\nBecause contact improvisation is a\nprocess of unmediated (by thought or\nsocialization) human action-reaction,\nit is a perfect vehicle for the observa-\ntion of human and personal behavior.\nThis fact underlies much of Steve\nPaxton's interest in contact as a per-\nformance medium as he explained to\nus in Minneapolis. Watching the flow\nof physical attention through the re-\nsponsive bodies, one sees unedited\nminds in motion, unpremeditated and\nunmediated by social or theatrical\nforms. The dance provides us with\nimmediate access to the flow, each\nmoment significant and, in theory,\nnone more so than any other. With\nthe focus on the dance, the audience\nenergy serves to heighten that focus,\nnot draw it out. The result, as evi-\ndenced in the performances of Free\nLance [Danny Lepkoff, Lisa Nelson,\nSteve Paxton, Nancy Stark Smith,\nChristina Svane] , is not virtuoso per-\nformances but dance stripped of its\nartiface, the artless art. The form\npoints to its own meaning; we watch\nthe body-mind operating largely free\nof conceptual discrimination.\nContact can always inform the be-\nhavior of those who practice it. Yet,\nwhen performed as a \"behavioral\"\nprocess it will always run the risk of\nappearing dull, self-righteous and pre-\ntentious to certain audiences. This is\nlargely a matter of signification. We\nall exist and operate in worlds of pri-\nority and meaning; a multi-faceted en-\nvirorunent takes on significance\nthrough socialization, ambition and\nhabit. Contact improvisation steps\naway from these into a world of pre-\ncognitive, nonconceptual physical\nactivity: the small dance. This is\nthe ongoing process of awareness and\nresponsiveness which requires no\nthought. (It puts functioning and\ncreativity beyond our faculty of rea-\nson.) To watch the small dance is\nto confront one's needs for signifi-\ncance and meaning as habitually un-\nderstood. If performed with integrity\nit is a constant revelation of the\nwatcher's process of signification.\nAt the same time the dancing it-\nself tends toward an evenness of ten-\nsion and dynamic. As the signifi-\ncance of action is from moment to\nmoment, at a distance the activity\nhas little meaning or shape. Are we\nleft with a small dance one must sit\nnext to in order to see? A small dance\nwith no meaning in the larger picture\nof emotions, politics, morality and\nprogress? A small dance only bound\nto touch a small number of people?\nThe paradox is there. In each of us\nis the small dance with no \"mean-\ning\", the small dance which belies\nthe importance we place on mental\nand social forms in our lives, the\nsmall dance which is closest to life\nand death and hardest to feel.\nIt is also of interest to view what I\nwill call the behavioral contact per-\nformance from the dancer's side.\nMark's concerns are again relevant\nhere. For him a danger related to\nthis approach is the dictum to \"go\nwith the flow of natural events, rather\nthan attempting to shape those events\non one's own. This viewpoint is de-\nstructive because it precludes creativi-\nty.\" What is the creative process for\nthe behavioral performer? Without\nthe dancer's traditional involvement\nin dramatic, rhythmic, spatial or dy-\nnamic tension, wherein lies the crea-\ntive act? Is contact a minimal art? A\nnonexistent art? I would propose that\nthe creative process lies between the\nbehavioral process (the contact dance)\nand the observant mind, both of\nwhich lie within the dancer.\nThe fihe line for the dancer/artist\nlies between purely experiential danc-\ning and mindful editorial directing,\nbetween self-indulgent movement\n(i.e. no care for the audience) and\nperformed improvisation. The disci-\npline is walking the line, and the aes-\nthetic lies in that distance, that ten-\nsion, that space created for witnessing\nthe unmediated behavioral process.\nThis creative tension within the\ndancer is perhaps what distinguishes\nbehavioral contact from other disci-\nplines: aikido, massage, therapy, im-\nprovisational dance. The loss of this\ntension explains why contact so often\nloses its integrity especially in per-\nformance. A performer will often\ngravitate towards a form which is\nmore actively creative on a physical\nlevel (i.e. theatre, dance improvisa-\ntion, acrobatics, slapstick comedy)\nor less demanding on an attitudinal\nlevel. When the integrity holds, be-\nhavioral contact is a joy to watch.\nMuch as one marvels at and is en-\nthralled by wild animal behavior or\nprimitive human ceremonies, here is\nadded the fact that the performers\nare so like us but stripped of ego and\nconvention as they move.\n* * *\nMangrove began its improvisation-\nal performance process essentially in\nthe behavioral mode, but intentional-\nly as a group process open to sound,\nsolo and improvisational impulse.\nGradually the creative focus became\nthe transformational process within\nand between us. Contact created a-\nwareness, physical vocabulary and\nenergy exchange for our process. Yet,\nperhaps more fundamentally, it estab-\nlisbed an unmediated flow into which\nwe could submerge and out of which\nwe could emerge. Our intention was\nnot simply to observe the behavior\nbut to play with the forms that ap-\npeared through the dancing: push\nthem, alter them, shape them, echo\nthem. In other words developing\nawareness over time as well as in the\nimmediate moment and encouraging\nrecognition of energy forms in the\nmovement flow other than just kin-\nesthetic. These include leader-follow-\ner, mirroring, rhythmic play, gesture,\nfocus of attention, attitude and even\nconceptual meaning. Extensions of\nthis have led us into vocalizing, use of\ncharacter and musical instruments.\nThe resulting performance form has\ncreated a very different pattern of\nmeaning from the behavioral mode.\nIs it contact? Are we involved in\na new discipline with a different con-\ntact aesthetic? Or have we simply put\nnew movement skills at the service of\nan old form? I was very interested to\nwatch a group from Washington, D.C.\nperforming at the Guild Conference.\nFree Association did a 45 minute set\nwhich was essentially a free-flow of\nmovement/theatre improvisation. I\nrecognized many elements of process\nwork; I could empathize with all the\ndifferent choices which confronted the\ndancers. This company I believe is six\nyears old (Mangrove is five) and they\ndo not use contact as such. Is there\nsome fundamental difference in the\nnature of our works and is it related\nto contact? Mangrove is certainly not\ncloser to Free Lance than to Free As-\nsociation.\nEarlier I spoke of two aspects of\ncontact improvisation: its functional\nnature and its relationship to personal\nresponsibility. A third aspect which\nfor me triangles out from the other\ntwo is the realm of communication.\nThis is necessary for and a result of\neach of the other two; it is the basis\nof relationship. Awareness of the\nsmall dance implies the opening of\nfreer communication within the body.\nWeight exchange implies communica-\ntion between bodies dancing. Sharing\nawareness of the <lance's flow in terms\nof rhythm, space, dynamic and atti-\ntude implies subtle communication on\na more expanded scale. By appreci-\nating this range of activity from inter-\nnal to external, awareness and commu-\nnication may be viewed as different\nfacets of energy flow.\nWe relate to an arbitrary boundary\nof the skin surface for interacting with\nothers especially in contact because\nwe are generally aware of feeling be-\nyond it. However, we see beyond it,\nhear beyond it, sense air currents,\ntemperature, balance and tension be-\nyond it. With the eyes closed and put-\nting our body image out of mind, we\nbuild a very different picture of our\npresence: it may extend from the\nstreet noise outside to the throbbing\nin the head; from the feet on the\nfloor to the sense of others watching.\nJust as the small dance of a stand is a\ndynamic balance of continual internal\nmovement so a dance space can be ex-\nperienced as a system of constant en-\nergy flow in dynamic balance. Ener-\ngy moves when a body is lifted, when\neyes shift focus, when breathing fills\none's awareness, when an onlooker\ngasps.\nAs dancer and performer I want to\nsense the energy flows, give them sub-\nstance through my dancing, play with\nthem and transform them. I want to\ncommunicate with an audience the re-\nlational rather than isolated or fixed\nnature of the world, through the inter-\nplay of many levels of energy, includ-\ning theirs as audience wa.ching. In\nMangrove this energy flow abstraction\nis realized through the many facets of\nus as human beings. We move through\nspace, we touch and interact, we cre-\nate vocal sound, we verbalize images,\ncommands, rhetoric and dialogue, we\nindicate emotional energy, we creai:e\ngroup rituals, we play and laugh at our-\nselves, we take on roles and we play\nmusic. Sometimes we are vessels for\nthe spirit, sometimes we are craftsmen\nof the theatrical space, sometimes we\nare cut off frcm others and ourselves.\nFor all of this contact is a bridge, a\npath, a door. Its functionality helps\nminimize our show, our front, our\ncleverness. The sense of personal re-\nsponsibility fostered has been at the\nheart of our collective process and\nour aesthetic mix. Communication\nfuels our personal/physical relation-\nships and those with our audiences.\nIt is this sense of relationship (de-\nscribed by one critic: \"no matter how\nclose there was always space in be-\ntween, no matter how far there was\nalways connection\") which I feel dis-\ntinguishes us from Free Association\nand Free Lance; and for me it is an\naesthetic derived from contact im-\nprovisation. Our relational process\nruns the gamut from being undisting-\nuished servants of the space's energy\nto insensitive manipulators of the\nsame. Certainly the discipline is much\nharder to pin down in relational con-\ntact. Mangrove deals with traditional\ncreative tensions: space, rhythm, fo-\ncus, emotion and meaning. But as the\nform is one of relational process, I see\nthe primary tension being between en-\nergy and form: can the everchanging\nform reflect the energy in the space?\nIs it contact improvisation and does\nit matter? Is the relational form a\ndistinct discipline or an amalgam of\nother disciplines? Where do behavior-\nal and relational contact lead us in\nthe future? How do they relate to\ndance and choreography? What about\nCatpoto, Contactworks, Men Work-\ning, Mirage and Faircatch? Are there\nother performance processes and con-\ntact-derived aesthetics? As contact\nimprovisation is the folk-art-sport of\nan ever diversifying community, we\ncan expect the nature of our public\ndancing to reflect the state of our art.\nThe questions remain. I leave you\nwith one final query:\nIs contact a small dance? ll",

    "Text": "Seven days after the Judson Dance Theater Recon-\nstructions at St. Mark's Church and the event seems a thing\nof the past. More so, even, than the original events done in\nthe '60s. It was a little bit like seeing an old family photo\nof an event that is indelibly etched in your memory, but\nwhen viewed directly seems very far away. The event is\nmore clearly gone, but even so, the memory remains current.\nMaybe that's because a memory, as it's carried through time,\ncan change, and adapt to the new time. Though memories\ntend to slip away when they're no longer relevant, fixing\nthem extinguishes their fire much sooner.\nI'd never been to Judson, and I was glad to see the 17\nreconstructed works, but I was not nearly as filled with the\nspirit of Judson in the '60s as I had anticipated. I feel the\nspirit of those times best in the sense of humor, support,\nand challenge that I've witnessed between artists whose\nfriendships were forged in that period-the permission to\nundermine one another, in fact the hope that if one got too\ncomfortable, someone would pull the rug out from under\nyou and set you spinning again.\nAnd so it is ten years since the first public perform-\nances of Contact Improvisation. People are talking now of\nproducing historical Contact Improvisation events, writing\nbooks about Contact, and this issue of Contact Quarterly is\nCl's 10th anniversary issue.\nAt least one baton that seems to have been passed\nfrom the Judson world of the '60s to Contact in the '70s\nis a resistance to being solidified-the sense that to stay in\none place too long is to freeze there. But whether you stay\nor go further, a \"place\" has inevitably been cleared by your\npassing, and that point of reference exists. Every day more\ntrails are blazed to, from, through and around that place,\nwith other landmarks forming along the way; and so it be-\ncomes increasingly difficult and in fact pointless to fix its\nouter limits.\nThere does seem, however, to be a center-a down-\ntown, as it were-to this sprawling Contact metropolis.\nBut that center isn't exactly on the map. It's more implied\nthan stated, suggested by the overlapping spheres of experi-\nence that the work produces. The activity of Contact itself\nis remarkably straightforward and recognizable, but the ex-\nperience of it is relative. An atmosphere of curiosity has\nmade the work a currency of exchange rather than a place\nto go-awkward for those who had expected to someday\narrive somewhere. The way is the going itself; we remem-\nber what we are left with, but not always where we left\nfrom.\nOne night at the Vermont Movement Workshop in\nPutney a few summers ago, about 50 people gathered for\na discussion about Contact. No particular subject was\nslated. So, we started from scratch and asked, What is this\nthing called Contact Improvisation that people are so hot\nto do?, What is it? Some people said it was about commu-\nnication, a code of sorts; others said it was about sharing\nweight, getting a rigorous workout, acquiring new skills,\nand others said it was about developing sensitivity. And\nthe list went on. After the discussion, on our way back to\nour rooms, a few of us were walking past a cabin where\nsome of the students were living and I heard through an\nopen window as we walked past, \"They know what it is,\nbut they just won't tell. That Steve Paxton has passed on\na legacy of ambiguity that keeps everyone from saying\nwhat it is, but they know.\" I laughed when I heard her,\nbut I've thought about what she said a lot since then. And\nI think she's right. Not only did Steve offer a dance, but a\nbuilt-in way of keeping it alive. Thanks, Steve, for that one.",

    "Text": "I am examining the passage from up to down.\nI look at the range of the passage, from the small\ndance of standing, to the linked falls of walking, to swoops\nand dives from high points on other bodies.\nWith experience, the act of falling has come to\ninclude an ability to adapt my body to the variables of\ndistance, position, and direction and to intuit which part\nof my body will take the first moment of impact.\nThe first part of my body that touches the ground\nI can use as a lever. By extending to that part, I can unify\nlimbs and torso to prepare a sequence through which to\nsmoothly transmit the energy of the fall, and my weight,\ninto the floor. Within the brief freedom of the fall, my\nbody can convert a sudden accident into a controlled\ndescent.\nThe result of so many changes in spatial and kines-\nthetic orientation in a short time has caused me to perceive\nspace as spherical. The sphere is an accumulated image\ngathered from several senses-vision being one. As if quick-\nly looking in all directions gives me an image of what it\nmight be like to have a visual surface all over my body,\ninstead of skin.\nThe skin is the best source for the image, because it\nworks in all directions at once. If we could turn the skin\noff, we would appreciate it much more. But the skin works\nmost of the time on automatic pilot. The conscious mind\nis alerted if unusual stimulation appears on the surface of\nthe body, but, I don't notice the touch of my clothes or\nmy weight in a chair most of the time.\nIn Contact Improvisation, however, I find I am hang-\ning by my skin. And relying on its information to protect\nme, to warn me, to feed back to me the data to which I am\nresponding.\nWe are looking at material from 1972, training for\nthe first performance of Contact Improvisation, at the\nJohn Weber Gallery. It was a hot New York City day, but\neveryone seemed game.\nWhat can be learned by catching a hurtling body?\nThe importance of timing. That there is such a thing as a\ncorrect preparation. That understanding the technique\nwith the mind is different than understanding with the\nbody. That momentum can be extended and used once\nthe initial impact is absorbed or deflected. Or that the\nseemingly impossible juxtaposition of a small woman\ncatching a large man has possibilities-most of them lead-\ning to the floor. But that is reasonable. Trying to stop\nor hold too much weight is dangerous. The idea is to dis-\ncover what is simplest to do.\nIn a state of trust of the body and the earth, we\nbelieved we could learn to handle the forces involved in\nphysical interactions between two people who permit\neach other the freedom to improvise.\nThe first instant of any fall is crucial. At that point\na roll may be prepared. If the preparation isn't made at\nthe first moment, falling takes place without guidance\nfrom the faller.\nWhat can a body do to be safe? Commitment to\nsomething which isn't happening is a barrier between me\nand my body's circumstance.\nMemory of past judgements tells me that prejudging\nis not secure. And memory cannot function consciously\nbecause at these speeds I can't think my way to safety.\nIf thinking is too slow, is an open state of mind use-\nful? Seems to be.\nI remember deciding to learn falling skills, which\nhave become muscle memories. I figured my chances of\nsurvival were greater with these skills than without-an\nassessment of things to come. In this way, prejudgement\nand memory do play a part in what is happening now.\nAlthough adults and children fall at the same veloc-\nity, adults are more liable to injure themselves because\ntheir mass is greater in proportion to structural strength.\nIt is possible to develop responses to deal with this safely.\nSlides, rolls or full surface landings, which spread the im-\npact of landing over as much of the muscle area as possible,\nare useful in Contact Improvisation as they are in the\nmartial arts of Japan.\nI am concerned with the possibilities of guiding the\nmomentum of the fall away from collision with the floor\nor partner. A body could endure for decades. I don't\nwant to injure joints. On the other hand, shouldn't focus\non doom.

The exigencies of\nthe form dictate a mode of movement which is relaxed, constantly aware and prepared, and on-flow-\ning. As a basic focus, the dancers remain in physical touch, mutually supportive and innovative, me-\nditating upon the physical laws relating to their masses: gravity, momentum, inertia and friction.\nThey do not strive to achieve results but rather, to meet the constantly changing physical reality with\nappropriate placement and energy.",

    "Text": "Values\nKERIAC: Someone at the seminar on politics in FOCUS\n'78 in Berkeley, my first Contact Intensive, postulated\nthat perhaps Contact is what we white liberals need to\nto make ourselves whole: it balances us. Other cultures have\nnot deprived themselves of touch and the rest that Contact\nprovides, so they don't need it as much; they need other\nthings.\nMARK: In what ways does Contact fit in with tbe values\nand needs of the white counterculture?\nK: Contact is concerned with intuition, aesthetics, physi·\ncality, \"being present in the flow.\" That's definitely\n\"counter\" to the mainstream culture's emphasis on\nrationality, intellect, status, and achievement.\nI'm a third generation Contactor: I learned about\nContact not from the originators, but from their students.\nI keep thinking of questions I'd like to ask the originators,\nbecause I'd like to know if some of the political implica-\ntions that I see in Contact are just my own projections, or\nwere the values of my teachers, or actually came from the\noriginators themselves and were consciously intended to\nbe a part of the work. For instance: why was this form\nnamed Contact Improvisation and not Steve Paxton Tech·\nnique? In the entire modern dance world, every new\napproach except Contact is based on a cult of personality:\nGraham technique, Cunningham technique, Hawkins\ntechnique, etc. The Contact originators probably pro-\nceeded into this name very naturally, without even think·\ning about it. But to me, that name is revolutionary-it\nreflects a whole new value system in dance.\nM: What was this value system?\nK: A notion of equality among people working together,\nwithout stars. I understand that Paxton was a teacher at\nBennington at the time he began exploring Contact, and\nthat his co-workers were mostly students. And yet, if two\npeople try to do Contact while maintaining the typical\nstudent-teacher relationship, I think those two wouldn't\nend up doing much Contact at all. Both the name and the\nform itself assume that Contact is a collective creation that\nis bigger than individuals. There is a letting go of ego, and\na letting go of traditional role expectations, that is unpre-\ncedented in dance.\nEffort-Shape work is another approach to dance that is\nnot called by the originator's name. But Effort-Shape is\nbased on an amazingly thorough and rigorous analysis of\nmovement by Rudolph Laban. Laban's contribution was\nessentially intellectual, and the dancers who made use of\nhis theories contributed the physical application that is\nnow referred to as \"Effort-Shape\". Contact is essentially\na physical manifestation. Have you ever struggled to de-\nfine Contact? Every time someone asks me \"What is\nContact Improvisation?\" my mind goes blank, even though\nI have carefully read and studied many written definitions\nof CI trying to prepare for this inevitable occasion. I in-\nvariably end up demonstrating physically. I think the best\ndefinition of Contact is \"that which happens when you do\nContact.\" We can extrapolate theories from Contact, but\nwhat we have been given is a physical legacy.\nl remember that Laban's theories had a similar impact\non my dance work as Contact has had. It was a joyful\nrelease from the mind-set: \"the correct way to study dance\nis to memorize and duplicate the movements of a famous\ndancer.\" This method does give you the advantage of\nlearning someone else's lifetime of bodily insights, but\nwhose body? Laban's work outlined the basic principles\nof dance design much as the Bauhaus has outlined the\nprinciples of visual and three-dimensional design for visual\nartists. It gives the dancer a choice of the whole universe\nof dance material, not just the iota that one famous person\nhas dedicated his or her life to. That way, each person can\nchoose the iota that best suits his or her own temperament,\nwhich is likely to produce a much more deeply felt com-\nmitment to their work. The result of freeing dancers from\nthe master-apprentice model will be a lot more diversitv\nand creativity in dance. Contact also frees dance from 'the\nmaster-apprentice model. A maxim I picked up from my\nContact teachers: \"The dance (Contact) is the teacher.\"\nM: In what other specific ways does Contact reflect a new\nvalue system?\nK: Well, take the notion of taking responsibility for your-\nself, which is a big lesson to be learned in Contact. In\nTransactional Analysis there is a concept called \"the rescue\ntriangle\", containing the roles of the victim, the prosecutor\nand the rescuer. According to this schema, when a person\ntries to \"help\" someone else by \"taking care of her'', they\ncreate a victim who will later resent and persecute them\nfor it. The way to avoid this dynamic is by not doing\nmore than 50 percent of the work. To do more is \"taking\nover\" someone else's problem, and laying a subtle power\ntnp. In a Contact duet, you only do 50 percent of the\nwork: you 're simply responsible for yourself. You are\nempathetic with your partner, in some situations you even\nextend help to your partner, but you do so in a way that\ndoesn't take over the duet or solve what is basically your\npartner's problem. Giving body surface to ease your part-\nner's fall, rather than grabbing your partner to \"save him\"\nis a prime example. In a Contact duet, each partner takes\nassertive actions, but each does so in a way that leaves\nchoices open to the partner. When you jump on a contact\ndancer, she may roll out from under you; she may choose\nnot to take your weight in the way you predicted, and\nthat's part of the dance. Contact makes an important poli-\ntical statement about relationships-about what is my re-\nsponsibility, my territory, my decision making power; and\nwhat is yours.\n\nFolk Art & State Art\nK: I have a pet theory I'd like to throw out, based on\nCurt Sach's book World History of the Dance: Art can\nbe divided into \"Folk Art\" and \"State Art\". When ballet\nbegan, it went like this: all through Europe there was folk\ndancing; each village had its own dance. Dance had a real\nfunction in the ordinary lives of ordinary people; it was\nfor weddings, funerals, religious festivals. It was for mark-\ning passages in individual lives and for coalescing a com-\nmunity spirit. It was inherently participatory. Political\npower in Europe was scattered in fiefdoms among many\nnobles. Then one of those nobles became more powerful\nthan his neighbors, took over the lands around him and\nbecame king of that land. The King brought the disenfran-\nchised nobles to his court, and absorbed their power. At\ncourt, the nobles didn't have anything useful to do; society\nlife took over-dances, parties, social events. For enter-\ntainment, peasants were brought in from the country to\ndemonstrate their dances. The nobles watched, the peas-\nants danced. The nobles applauded the highest jumps, the\nfanciest turns, the flashiest costumes. Technique and\nshowmanship became the content of the dance; Dance\nbecame a performance art.\nWhen the dancing was over, the peasants were given\na good meal and sent back to resume their work on the\nland. One or two peasants, the ones who had been the\nmost amusing to the audience, were asked to remain at\ncourt. These few spent their days refining their technique,\ngiving performances and teaching dance (it became\nfashionable for nobles to learn the peasant dances.) The\nart of the King's dancers gave the King power over others,\nin the same way that the King's stable of fine horses added\nto his status and power over others. As long as their ballet\ncontinued to awe the audience, the dancers did not work\nat crafts or till the soil; they ate at the King's table. They\nwere professional dancers.\nI have told this story as though \"State Art\" only arose\nin Europe, but I believe it has happened all over the world.\n\"State Art\" is characterized by an emphasis on technique\nwhich is mastered by a dedicated few, who then are\nwatched by an audience. It is inherently elitist-a few\ntalented people are given the resources necessary to sup-\nport their artistic growth on a full-time basis; their achieve-\nments are then used to enhance and increase the status\nand power of the aristocratic patron who has the wealth\nto pay the bill. It is characterized by competition between\nartists and between patrons, by separation of performer\nfrom audience, by its emphasis on style rather than spirit.\n\"Folk Art\" is characterized by its accessibility to all\npeople-the steps are simple, the spirit in which you do it\nis more important than virtuosity. It is non-professional-\nyou kick your heels in the village festival, and then go\nback to your survival support~ng work t?e next day. It is\nparticipatory-it's your weddmg, your life happenmg\nthrough the dance. You do not dance because you have\nto, you do not dance for someone else's pleasure, accord-\ning to someone else's standards. You dance by your own\nchoice, for your own satisfaction and because it co~nects\nyou with others. There is no applause, the reward ts the\ndancing itself.\nContact as Folk Art\nK: I see Contact as a folk art, with folk art values inher-\nent in the work. Its basis is kinesthetic, rather than visual.\nThe dance unfolds from giving primary attention to the\nbodily sensations of the dancer rather th:in from atte~ding\nto how it will look to the vi~wer. I~ ts a cooperative,\nconnecting-to-others form. While dancmg Cont~c~, y_ou\nexist in the present, from moment to moment-it ts liter-\nally your life in the act of living. The context chosen for\nContact activities at its onset reflected folk art values:\nno stage lights, no costumes, no proscenium stage, \"per-\nformers\" would grunt, groan, talk casually to each other,\ntalk to the audience, quit dancing abruptly. Conta.ct\n\"performances\" frequently seen:ed like. a commumty\ngathering in witness of an event m the lives of the perform-\ners rather than an entertainment for the audience. The\nweh-established phenomenon of the Contact Jam is unique\namong modern dance activities: the jam is n~t a class to\nlearn better technique, not a performance to impress . .\nothers, it is dancing for its own sake, and a way to socialize\nwith your community.\nM: That may be the way Contact was performed and\npracticed at the beg~nning, bu_t th~t doesn't seem too\ndescriptive of what is happening right now. [Note date\nof interview-Eds.]\nK: True. Contact performance groups are showing a trend\ntoward incorporating \"State Art\" values into the work.\nTake Mangrove as an example. They s~ill perform. most of\nthe time with simple lights, no proscemum stage, mformal\natmosphere. These are all anti-elitist elements. H~wever,\nMangrove has steadily increased the!r use of the~tncal ele-\nments blended into the contact, which makes this essen-\ntially participatory form more \"performance. orie~ted\".\nNow they are blending choreographed material wit~ con-\ntact as well, and also including modern dance techmque\nand \"theater courses as part of their workshop classes.\nM: What political implications does this have?\nK: Bringing folk art values int~ a perform~nce situation\nand making it work is a revolut10nary act, m my book. It\nnot only re-defines what is possible to be performed, but\nalso fundamentally alters our perceptions of interpersonal\nand power relationships. Are we (as audie~ce member~)\nstand-ins for our aristocratic predecessors, mtent on bemg\nentertained; are we stand-ins for our peasant predecessors,\nwitnessing a community ritual; o~ is this new perfo~mance\nmode actually building a new societal structure which does\nnot presume class division?\n\nTraditions\nM: There are now individuals and groups doing Contact\nwho not only perform for money but who are supported\nby grants.\nK: Right. They're doing a form which is anathema to\n\"State Art\" values, yet they're plugging in to state sup-\nport. Revolutions are not necessarily what will earn a\nliving. My intuition is that Mangrove and _other grou~s\nlike them will have to make some concess10ns to tradi-\ntional values in order to survive professionally. If you\ntry to make your living as a performing group, there is\npressure to fit into the traditional _mold. The pressure.\ndoes not only come from the outside, but al.so f!o~ with-\nin. As performers, we naturally w~nt to ~amtam ht~h\nstandards and communicate effectively wtth our audience.\nOur internalized sense of what is \"good quality perform-\nance\" is largely based on the previous model availabl~ to\nus-\"State Art\". This model has also shaped the audi-\nence's expectations to such an extent th~t the public may\nnot be able to perceive your work at all if you do not\nconform to tl}e assumptions and values expected.\nM: It seems as if there is a set of considerations, in tradi-\ntional art, that people think validate their dance, such as\nworking with a teacher, preferably a well-~nown one, or\nan established choreographer, or an established ~ompany.\nAlso: working on specifically choreographed pieces.\nDoing performances that resemble traditional ones. Going\non tour. Doing publicity. Applying for grants.\nK: All those things validate your dance. But what di:> they\nvalidate? Your technical competence, not your creative\nskill. My technique was always lousy, and I w~s more in-\nterested in creative work. I wanted to create first, then\ndevelop my technique to get under it. But th_e opposite is\nthe expected way. First you learn how to pomt your toe,\nand after years and years of practice, when you are really\ngood at pointing your toe, you might be given the respon-\nsibility of determining which direction you point your toe.\nThat really limits your creativity, because after all that\ntime of learning someone else's choreography, you develop\nhabits and blind spots of what your own capabilities are.\nThis split between technique and creativity is vety unfor-\ntunate; and one of the marvelous things about Contact is\nthat the technique and creativity happen simultaneously.\nM: Do you agree that Contact is esthetically revolutionary,\nthat it was a conscious attempt to subvert traditional\ndance esthetics?\nK: That's definitely what it seems like to me. But I wasn't\nat Judson Church in New York in the sixties, when Steve\nPaxton and others were turning a lot of performance as-\nsumptions upside down, so I don't know for sure if it was\nconscious or not.\nThe abstraction which became prevalent in modern\ndance in the 60's and which still dominates a lot of today's\ndance was a reaction against the intense emotionalism of\nMartha Graham-type dance. Choreographers went to the\nopposite pole, using depersonalized bodies moving through\nspace, dealing with visual design without concern for psy-\nchological ramifications.\nM: So Contact is a reaction against abstraction?\nK: Yes. It's a form where dancers have become human be-\nings again. And these \"human\" dancers are, at least on a\nphysical level, connecting and' relating to each other. Con-\ntact dancers wear their own faces, not the neutral facial\nexpression or \"mask\" of the modern dancer.\nM: So Contact bas neither the abstraction and alienation,\nnor the romantic theatricality.\nK: Right. The difference between Graham \"human-ness\"\nand Contact \"human-ness\" is largely one of scale. Graham\ngoes deeper into herself, delving into her inner psyche, and\nthen she projects further out to the audience, the way an\nactress would, to the back of the opera house. Contact\ndancers project on a person-to-person scale. Your facial\nexpression isn't intended to go any further than you and\nyour partner, and the concerns expressed are usually direct-\nly related to the physical interaction happening in that\nmoment.\nM: It's more intimate in the sense that people are touching,\nand also it's simply on a more intimate scale.\nK: Real events happening between real people in real time.\nThat's why the audience sits so close, because otherwise\nyou miss half the action.\nM: Isadora Duncan swept away so much of the rigidified\ntradition in dance in her time, and ''Modern Dance\" was\nborn. Now ''Modern Dance\" seems traditional. The con-\ntemporary parallel to Duncan's impact is the Judson Church\ngroup. Contact is just one of the offshoots of the Judson\ngroup. In so many ways-in Deborah Hay's work, Simone\nForti, Anna Halprin, as well as Steve Paxton-they're still\nmaking an incredible revolution. Those people and their\nstudents will continue to revolutionize dance.\nK: Contact can also rigidify, given time. We need to keep\nalive a dialogue on these concerns, and foster the conscious-\nness raising of those of us who have been given this gift.\nAttitudes\nK: I was really hesitant about returning to teaching.\nThe traditional teacher-student model is inherently\ncorruptive of what I consider to be healthy power\nrelationships. The fact that one of my early exper-\niences of learning contact (the Focus Intensive in 1978)\nwas in an atmosphere of community was really important\nto me. Focus was taught by a diverse group of people,\nnone of whom claimed to have all the answers. The teach-\ners talked openly of their own weaknesses and inadequa-\ncies; they encouraged the students to teach one another;\nthey asked for criticism and input from the students; and\nthey scheduled community feedback sessions into the\nworkshop structure. There was a two-way dialogue be-\ntween the two groups of people who were experiencing\ndifferent but interdependent parts of the same experience.\nStudents had power and were expected to take that power.\nTo me, it was set up with the same values as a contact duet.\nThe Focus model of teacher-student relationships made me\nfeel that I could be a teacher, and still be \"politically\ncorrect\".\nM: It seems as if Contact is a form where that community\ncan happen readily because of its anti-elitist aspects. On\nthe other band, the form doesn't necessitate a communi-\ntarian atmosphere, it can be elitist as any other form. Like\nyou said, the inventors of contact could have just as easily\ninfused the form with traditional values. Fortunately they\ndidn't, so now Contact does contain certain progressive\nvalues, such as sexual equality, which are now inherent in\nit. Yet it still retains elitism in some areas: bead trips\n(whether warranted or not), classes where the instructor\nand student roles are cleariy defined and separate, and in\nsome per[ ormances. ~",

    "Text": "I am examining the passage from up to down.\nI look at the range of the passage, from the small\ndance of standing, to the linked falls of walking, to swoops\nand dives from high points on other bodies.\nWith experience, the act of falling has come to\ninclude an ability to adapt my body to the variables of\ndistance, position, and direction and to intuit which part\nof my body will take the first moment of impact.\nThe first part of my body that touches the ground\nI can use as a lever. By extending to that part, I can unify\nlimbs and torso to prepare a sequence through which to\nsmoothly transmit the energy of the fall, and my weight,\ninto the floor. Within the brief freedom of the fall, my\nbody can convert a sudden accident into a controlled\ndescent.\nThe result of so many changes in spatial and kines-\nthetic orientation in a short time has caused me to perceive\nspace as spherical. The sphere is an accumulated image\ngathered from several senses-vision being one. As if quick-\nly looking in all directions gives me an image of what it\nmight be like to have a visual surface all over my body,\ninstead of skin.\nThe skin is the best source for the image, because it\nworks in all directions at once. If we could turn the skin\noff, we would appreciate it much more. But the skin works\nmost of the time on automatic pilot. The conscious mind\nis alerted if unusual stimulation appears on the surface of\nthe body, but, I don't notice the touch of my clothes or\nmy weight in a chair most of the time.\nIn Contact Improvisation, however, I find I am hang-\ning by my skin. And relying on its information to protect\nme, to warn me, to feed back to me the data to which I am\nresponding.\nWe are looking at material from 1972, training for\nthe first performance of Contact Improvisation, at the\nJohn Weber Gallery. It was a hot New York City day, but\neveryone seemed game.\nWhat can be learned by catching a hurtling body?\nThe importance of timing. That there is such a thing as a\ncorrect preparation. That understanding the technique\nwith the mind is different than understanding with the\nbody. That momentum can be extended and used once\nthe initial impact is absorbed or deflected. Or that the\nseemingly impossible juxtaposition of a small woman\ncatching a large man has possibilities-most of them lead-\ning to the floor. But that is reasonable. Trying to stop\nor hold too much weight is dangerous. The idea is to dis-\ncover what is simplest to do.\nIn a state of trust of the body and the earth, we\nbelieved we could learn to handle the forces involved in\nphysical interactions between two people who permit\neach other the freedom to improvise.\nThe first instant of any fall is crucial. At that point\na roll may be prepared. If the preparation isn't made at\nthe first moment, falling takes place without guidance\nfrom the faller.\nWhat can a body do to be safe? Commitment to\nsomething which isn't happening is a barrier between me\nand my body's circumstance.\nMemory of past judgements tells me that prejudging\nis not secure. And memory cannot function consciously\nbecause at these speeds I can't think my way to safety.\nIf thinking is too slow, is an open state of mind use-\nful? Seems to be.\nI remember deciding to learn falling skills, which\nhave become muscle memories. I figured my chances of\nsurvival were greater with these skills than without-an\nassessment of things to come. In this way, prejudgement\nand memory do play a part in what is happening now.\nAlthough adults and children fall at the same veloc-\nity, adults are more liable to injure themselves because\ntheir mass is greater in proportion to structural strength.\nIt is possible to develop responses to deal with this safely.\nSlides, rolls or full surface landings, which spread the im-\npact of landing over as much of the muscle area as possible,\nare useful in Contact Improvisation as they are in the\nmartial arts of Japan.\nI am concerned with the possibilities of guiding the\nmomentum of the fall away from collision with the floor\nor partner. A body could endure for decades. I don't\nwant to injure joints. On the other hand, shouldn't focus\non doom. Can't exclude fear.\nEfficient falls tend to turn into slides or rolls, trans-\nforming vertical momentum into horizontal travel.\nI may find a last minute leverage from my partner\nto enable me to land upon my feet. My fall might be\nguided so it spirals around the body of my partner. Thus,\na fall starting on the downward path can be guided into a\ncircle orbiting my partner, and finally, its momentum used\nto aid in regaining a high perch.\nContractive energy or tensions overpower the sensing\nof subtle movement, and so gravity is masked.\nRelaxed is almost right; but, flaccid is wrong.\nIn exploring the small dance of skeletal alignment\nwhile standing, I am sensing subtle falls of parts of the\nskeleton.\nOne thing is clear. I have little memory, muscular\nor mental, of what I've danced. The specific movements\nmy body executes when I improvise do not register con-\nsciously, and I can't reconstitute them. I feel transparent\nin the action. Causing it only a little, and holding no\nresiduals. ~",

When Steve Paxton invited that\nfirst group of people to perform contact improvisation in\n1972, he had no technique for showing them what they\nwould be doing, or how they would do it safely; but he did\nhave a group of gifted athletes, people with strong physical\nbackgrounds, that could do potentially dangerous move-\nment with minimal risk of injury. Starting with that solid\nphysical base, they developed a movement form that was\nat once both spectacular and imaginative.\nAs contact began to be taught, physical surity could\nnot be assumed. Over the last decade, a comprehensive\ntechnique has evolved whereby students can very gently be\nintroduced to the range of physical states encountered in\nthe dancing. Moments from the dancing can be extracted\nand introduced to students in a controlled and structured\nsetting. Because of this, it has been possible to teach\npeople of greatly varying physical abilities complex physi-\ncal maneuvers. The capacity to teach skills and develop\nphysical range and confidence has made contact improvisa-\ntion highly accessible and attractive. It's provided the nec-\nessary and important function of laying a solid foundation\nfor full and open improvising.\nIn contact improvisation, the senses need to be edu-\ncated. Disorientation must become an acceptable sensation.\nA released body, supported in length, can be developed.\nTrust, patiently nurtured through confidence and familiar-\nity, prepares the way for diversity. Through trust, awk-\nward, uncomfortable moments of vulnerability and power-\nful moments of virtuosity become equally rich.\nWhen I began teaching contact, I wanted to pass on\nto others the simplicity and accessibility of the form. As\nteaching material, I chose those skills which I had been\ntaught and felt confident and competent in. I found it\npossible to teach others to do them also. I got a lot of sat-\nisfaction in seeing my students develop abilities to soften,\nto roll, to give and take weight in diverse situations. But\nafter several years of teaching this way, I began to feel\nlimited. I felt that in teaching skills I was operating within\na very finite field of experience. Though I was approaching\nwhat I considered to be the heart of the dancing, I wasn't\nquite there. Who was it that said there were 87 million\npermutations in contact? Well, I felt up against those per-\nmutations. It might take a very long time to find and\nteach all those permutations, but all I would be teaching\nwas permutations. It wasn't quite the dancing. \"'\nIt became burdensome to stay at least one step ahead\nof my students, each week coming up with new things to\ndo. They were all learning lots of physical possibilities,\ntypes of physical moments, but.week to week I felt weight-\ned by the task of finding new combinations for them to\nexperience, weighted by the dependency that kind of\nteaching fostered .\n. Developing skills is a necessary part of teaching and\nle~rnmg contact. But there's a danger in making these\nskills overly precious. It's important to remember that\nskills are meant to introduce types of experiences that may\nbe encountered in the dancing. What is found in that ex-\nperience is the important thing. It's important that stu-\ndents notice their growing acceptance of disorientation,\ntheir a~areness of the body's ability to organize and take\ncare of Itself, ~he trust and confidence they gain in them-\nselves and their partners to stay with a moment, and meet\nthe needs of each changing moment. Too often, though,\nstud~nts focus exclusively on mastery of maneuvers, chal-\nlengmg themselves with more and more complex maneu-\nvers as ~heir confidence increases. Mastery of maneuvers\ncan be important in gaining confidence, but I think it's\nmore important to take that confidence into the dancing\nthan to take the maneuvers. It's the orientation towards\na higher and higher refinement that runs the risk of dis-\ntracting students from the opportunities for a more per-\ns?nal exchange with their partner. The subtleties of any\ngiven moment can so easily be buried beneath the execu-\ntion of that next move.\nWhen people like Steve Paxton, Lisa Nelson, Daniel\nLepk?ff, and Nancy Stark Smith were performing and\nteachmg regularly, there seemed to consistently be new,\ngood dancers emerging through contact. A couple of years\nago a lot of g~od teaching and performing of contact drop-\nped off (here m North America). Perhaps this was due to\nthe fact that many of the early pioneers of contact had\nfo_und a fullness and maturity in their dancing that they\nwished to apply to other areas of interest. It seems natural\nto_ me t~at eight or so years of attention to any one thing\nwill begm to call forth derivatives. Maybe, as contact had\nestablished itself fairly solidly at that point, a new freedom\nexisted wherein they could let go of its nurturing. Also,\nas contact was just beginning to catch on in Europe, there\nwas the need for teaching and performing there.\nIn the absence of these dancers, I thought two things\nhappened. First, many people who had been doing contact\nfor awhile mistook these people's change for a change in\ncontact improvisation. A feeling began circulating that it\nwas time to \"do other things with contact.\" I remember\nthe phrase \"Contact is pead\" jokingly tossed about, cou-\npled with references to the \"Contact Obituary.\"\nThe second, and more important, is that contact con-\ntinued to be taught, mostly to newcomers, but with the\nabsence of high caliber dancing to be seen. It's occurred to\n~e th~t though the teaching at that time was sophisticated,\nIt was imbalanced, and the balancing element has never\nbeen introduced. I know that, for myself, once I had ac-\nquired a certain degree of physical competence through\nclasses, my real development in contact came through\nwatching and dancing with those high caliber dancers.\nThrough them I learned to improvise. Improvising was\nsomething I never really learned to do through classes.\n. This poin~s to a whole area that has been neglected\nm the the teachmg of contact. Though certain aspects of\nthe work can be easily articulated, the relationship of a\ndancer to a physical moment is harder to formulate. I can\nexplain my weight settling into a fold of my partner's\nbody, but I cannot explain the sensitivity or tenderness I\nmay feel. whic? make~ that moment alive for me. The pres-\nent challenge 1s to articulate that personal involvement\nwhich makes for a dynamic relationship with a physical\nevent. Any moment can be more than just following the\ncontact point. The person in the dancer can be engaged;\npersona! richness. can inhabit the dancing. This challenge\n1s especially pertment today. Up until now, we have relied\non the accessibility of inspiring improvisors to watch and\nhave taken a sense of freshness and originality from them\nback to our dancing. We have been able to dance with true\nartists. They have guided or thrown us into the unpredict-\nable. Today's need is to talk about how one keeps the\ndancing fresh and original; how one perceives one's relation-\nship to the changing physical material. Can we understand\nand share what \"improvising\" means? Can we teach it?\nThis winter, I began teaching an advanced contact\nclass with the hope that this was possible. My notes for\nthe first class read, \"Focusing on improvisation-moving\nfrom the general, perhaps we will make our way towards\nspecifics. By making certain types of physical sensations\nfamiliar to us through skills and exercises, we've learned to\nbe comfortable with, or at least accepting of, being disori-\nented. At a certain point, known physical pathways were\nrealized to be limited and repetitive, and the quest for new\npathways had become overbearingly goal-oriented, dry and\nlacking in improvisational unpredictability and richness.\nI'm interested in the range of states, qualities, and types of\nmoments that occur and are possible in a dance with a par-\nticular partner. How can our imagery and qualities slide\nthrough spaces and settle into nooks and crannies in the\nways we have become familiar with on a physical level, and\nbow can this more active state direct our dancing or parti-\ncipate in our dancing?\"\nOne idea I had was that it takes an internally active\nstate to look for and become aware of the range of qualities\npossible in a dance. It's the activity of identifying, person-\nally, with moment to moment occurrences in the dancing;\nallowing oneself to make a personal connection with a\nphysical event, so that moments in the dancing are occu-\npied, filled, lived-but not latched onto and played out-\njust stayed with for their duration in the same way that a\nphysical pathway is followed for the length of its phrase.\nThe first difficulty I had in getting to this material\nwas that pursuing and moving thr_ough known movement\npathways had become so automatic there was little room\nleft for anything unknown to occur. Mentally, students\nseemed so bent on finding things to do that they had diffi-\nculty allowing their minds to receive impressions. Moments\nin the dancing had no time or space to linger with the im-\nagination. The dancing may have been cunning, but it was\nnot imaginative.\nOne of the first things we began to do was to individ-\nually inhibit a way of dancing that in class was referred to\nas \"blabbing your body.\" In this type of dancing, there is\nalways a space of time between seeing a thing to do, decid-\ning to do it, and doing it. We began to work with the idea\nof eliminating that next, known movement pathways as an\noption; we could do anything but that thing we already\nknew we would do. As long as there was time in which we\ncould decide to do something, there was also time to decide\nnot to do that something.\nWe decided that as long as we had time, why not take\nit. An attitude st;emed to exist that in that time between\none event and another, nothing was happening. The possi-\nbility of lingering was \"re\"-introduced. Most contactors\nare familiar with the \"finger dance,\" where two people,\nfacing each other, extend a single finger each out into the\nspace between them; letting their fingers meet, they feed a\nlittle pressure into that area of contact. They notice the\nsmall, shared movement at their fingertips and as they allow\nthemselves to be willing and open, they follow and stay\nwith that small movement as it wanders through the space\nbetween their bodies. So long as both are willing to stay\nwith whatever that wandering is, they will find natural\npauses occurring, moments bursting with possibility, as\nthey stay with their commitment to a common decision\nthat is larger than either one of them.\nThese moments seem among the most exciting to me\nbecause they are completely unknown. We might stay here\nforever. We could end this dance here. Anything might\nhappen so long as both partners are willing.\nMoments of lingering had all but disappeared from\nthe dances l watched that first class. By re-introducing it\nas a possibility, and inhibiting old, automatic responses,\nspace was created in the dancing for fresh things to happen_\nWe began to hone in on these moments, looking first at our\nphysical activity. In those moments we noticed types of\npossibilities that we realized were there for every moment.\nThey were ongoing possibilities. In that space, we realized\na lot was already happening. By looking at what was im-\nmediately available, we could always find something that\nhad already begun.\nAs an example, we noticed the sensation of pressure\nwhere our bodies were in contact, and realized if we needed\nsomething to do we could work with that presstire. Some\nof the more interesting dances I'd seen or had in awhile\noccurred while working with this idea. Anytime a person\nfelt they needed to do something, they could change the\ndegree or quality of pressure. All our technical skills were\nstill there, although we weren't \"playing them.\" Instead,\nwe were just playing, and those skills were there to support\nour play. -\nAnother thing we worked with was the possibility of\nbeing involved in any given moment solely for the sake of\nour partner. Just because a space opened for me did not\nnecessarily mean one also opened for my partner. He or\nshe may be very involved in something, and by looking and\nseeing what I could do for them, I might support their fol-\nlowing their involvement further than they might other-\nwise.\nPerhaps the main territory I've become interested in\nexploring as teaching material is the imagination. I'd like\nto be able to talk about the kinds of things I do that let me\nbe involved in different moments of the dancing. I'd like\nto be able to talk about those moment to moment images\nthat flash through my mind-personal identifications that\ncorrelate with physical moments in the dancing=--and talk\nabout how my imagination operates when I improvise. For\nme, improvising is the imagination spontaneously relating\nwith form. When I am improvising, I feel that I am being\nbrought into sharper focus and find that more of myself is\nengaged and expressing that engagement than in any other\nactiviry.\nAnd it's for this reason I love contact improvisation.\nIt offers me the possibility of feeling alive in a way that is\nboth amplified and focused. It's that sense of being alive\nthat I saw and felt in dancing with those high caliber danc-\ners. A lot of other dancing seemed focused and amplified,\nbut it did not necessarily show the artistry or richness of\nthe dancers or the dancing. I think artistry and richness\nspring from the imagination, a person's response to or\nempathy for a physical event. I'm interested in how\nthese images and emotions that occur as personal identi-\nfications within the dancing, cycle the person back into\nthe movement. ~",

    "Text": "This is about friction, about two things rubbing up\nagainst each other, and the value of that heat. I'm the kind\nof person who tends to harmonize opposing forces. When\nfaced with a conflict, I'm always eager to jump to a perspec-\ntive that encompasses both sides, one in which they are no\nlonger at odds-a view that renders each side valid and useful\nand yet, as a result, often impersonal, removed from the\ninitial charge that formed it. But I'm beginning to see what\nI've been missing.\nThere's something to be said for two things rubbing each\nother the wrong way. The friction between them wears\neach side down to its undercoat, its framework, thus testing\nits strength and revealing its ground. True, the way the\nfriction is used and why are important factors. Sometimes\nwhen sharpening an edge, it is possible to cut off completely\nwhat you're just trying to hone down. But that's what\npractice is for. In Push Hands, a Tai Chi C::huan sparring\nform, for instance, one is looking through the touch, arm to\narm, for the resistance to the push. The partner tries to\n'empry' wherever the other pushes, to offer no resistance,\nthus hoping to draw the pusher off balance. The pusher\nperseveres with a delicate but relentless touch, to search\nthrough the other's inner space for their resistance, trying\nto force the question. Having finally backed the partner into\na corner, so to speak, inside their own body, the pusher has\nonly to push lightly (no more than 8 oz. of pressure) to send\nthe partner flying backward against the wall. They resume\nstarting positions eagerly-facing each other, body centered\nin a low, grounded stance, forearm to forearm-ready for\nanother go at it. Like hide and seek, it's only really fun to\nplay if someone's out to get you. And the more heated and\nskillful their search, the better the practice.\nThe Studies Project discussion between Bill T. ] ones and\nSteve Paxton, printed in this issue of CQ. is a juicy and per-\nsonal play, full of edges, pushes, falls and fakes. Several\ntimes during the talk, I felt myself wincing at the action as\none might while watching a boxing match when the swing\nconnects. I noticed myself subtly backing off from their\nverbal sparring when it seemed to be getting the most heated.\nBut luckily, I couldn't change the channel. What I saw light\nup in the heat of that friction was each man as an individual;\nhis unique perspective came into focus as it was forced to\nnarrow from a more general field of vision to a distinct point\nof view, teased and poked and pushed into the light. And\nthough I squirmed in the heat of that confrontation, I was\nat the same time struck by the commitment behind the\nstand.\nI've learned a lot from doing Contact Improvisation about\ncoordinating with the forces-that-be: Accepting graviry, fall-\ning, following momentum, blending with a partner's move-\nments-i.e., 'going with the flow.' But lately, I've been\nfeeling feisry. I'm a little too comfortable now with the\ndizzy of flipping horizons, torquing pathways and unexpect-\ned chutes, and more and more I find myself playing ag!linst\nthe forces-making myself heavy instead of light when a lift\nstarts, adding a splash to the easy pouring of weight, insisting\ninstead of yielding, adding fierce to gentle, no to yes. It's a\nstart. I've been in the harmony business a long time now.\nIt might take a while to really get the hang of holding my\nground instead of so gladly letting it slip out from under me.\nAs much as I love running around, I think I'm going to try\nrunning into things more often, or at least up against them.\nNancy Stark Smith",

There's\nsomething in the way the waitress calls out, \"One tossed,\none string bean, one turnip, two setups,\" that gets me.\nShe isn't just saying it, she's transmitting it, imprinting it ·\ndefinitely and temporarily on the minds of the men behind\nthe counter who are already in motion sliding the three\nbowls and two setups down the formica in a flash. I look\nat her eyes as she telegraphs these orders. They are weary\nbut come instantly to life and focus once she begins the\norder. Her intention, voice and message are joined in a\nsingle certain direction. They aim to get across. And re-\nmarkably, in this fast-paced short-order full-dinner diner,\nthe meals get served up right.\nObscurely, but surely, this rubs up against the issue at\nhand. Contact. Intention. Message. Moving. The Quart-\nerly. As a vehicle for moving ideas, what is Contact\nQuarterly moving, and to/for whom? Not long ago, it was\ncommon for people to say that they didn't read CQ be-\ncause they didn't do Contact. Now, after years of extend-\ning the scope of our 'what', 'to whom', and 'how', we seem\nto have nearly thrown the baby out with the bath water ...\nHaving breakfast the other day with a long-time practi-\ntioner, teacher and performer of Contact Improvisation, it\noccurs to me that he probably hasn't seen the new issue of\nCQ and I eagerly reach down for the one in my bag. But\nhe's squirming uncomfortably and I hesitate, and look up.\n\"You know I really don't read the Quarterly anymore,\"\nhe says, \"Maybe I should tell you why.\" \"Please,\" I say,\nslipping my hand out of my bag and onto my lap. In\nshort, he says that as the mouthpiece for Contact Improvi-\nsation, CQ isn't getting to the substance of what people\nare doing, but only printing superficial, undeveloped re-\nports. Sympathetic and amused to see the magazine in this\nstrangely inverted position, I agree with him (almost) com-\npletely, and ask him why he hasn't written about the great\nworkshop he's just spent the last hour telling me about.\nIt is true that people are busy doing, perhaps too busy\nto be telling of it. And perhaps it's also true that their\ntales, were they to be told, might no longer fit comforta-\nbly-in form or content-into the format of the CQ News-\nletter, now slated for Contact exchanges. More import-\nantly, is there really a call for this kind of exchange?\nJudging not only from my recent breakfast talk, but from\nthe number of charged conversations that found their way\ninto and around the busy schedule at St. Mark's Church\nduring the two week Contact At 10th and 2nd festival\nin NY last June, it is clear that the appetite is there to talk\nand hear about how people are working in and from Con-\ntact. The real hands-on stuff. As is said, It furthers one\nto have somewhere to go.' So, as of this issue, we've\nopened a new column, Still Moving. to make room for\nthat rich flow of ideas to run through.\nBut let it be said that Contact Quarterly is not the final\nword on nor the official mouthpiece for Contact Improv-\nisation. If anything, we're simply a mouth, changing shape\nto fit the words that you put in it. So go ahead, put words\nin our mouth. But, like the waitress in the diner, it's not\nthe words themselves that will give the message life; only\nthe desire to communicate can finally bring them across.",

    "Text": "Cynthia Hedstrom is leaving\nDanspace (at St. Mark's Church, NYC).\nShe has directed its use for three years\nand created a center in which the dance\nculture of Lower Manhattan moved\nand thrived. The space is one of the\ndesirable venues for dances born in\nloft studios. The proportions are larger\nthan the usual studio, but intimate\nenough to convey the sort of non-the-\natrical detail frequently laced through\nnew dance work. The floor is hard and\nfast. The audience sits on carpeted\nsteps under a balcony on three sides of\nthe room. The upper area serves for\nlights and video/photo documentation.\nHigh above the floor, the ceiling vault\nis a great curve which caps the air\nlightly and elegantly.\nCarol Mullins does the lighting and\nDan Froot coordinates other elements:\nsound, slides, films and sets.\nThis team handled the many details,\nchanges, complications of CONTACT\nAT 10th & 2nd with care and efficien-\ncy. It is something of a test to produce\nnew works and improvisations because\nmuch remains unknown, untested or\nmutable right down to the wire. A\ntight, light, responsive system is inval-\nuable for breaking new ground. How-\never fine and airy the space itself may\nbe, it is this team which made the\nhouse comfortable for the several\ndozen choreographers and performers\nwho gathered there for 7 productions\nJune 10, 11, 12 & 16, 17, 18, 19, 1983.\nThe performers and choreographers\nhad a great deal to pull together them-\nselves. They arrived from England,\nCalifornia, Canada, the US, and from\naround Manhattan, with their concepts,\nimprovisations and dancing bodies.\nThey arranged themselves into the\ngeneral format of Contact Improvisa-\ntion or Choreographed/semi-set works\nwith minimal ado. As (traffic) director\nof these events, I am eternally grateful\nfor their grace under fire.\n•\nContact Improvisation has been a\nperformance form since its inception.\nAudiences and critics have challenged\nthe appropriateness of this decision,\nand I think it true that the audience-\nperformer relationship may serve the\nperformer here as much or more than\nthe audience, certainly for those ob-\nservers who require more explicit sig-\nnalllng of intent in their audit.\nTheir expectation is a rather fruit-\nless approach to Contact Improvisation.\nIt is, after all, improvisational. Intent\nand manifestation amount to the same\nthing. Further, any contact duet is a\nmanifestation of a fraction of the pos-\nsibilities of the form, so, audiences\nseeing a performance for the first time\nmust be content with the specifics of\nthat dance, if not the general idea.\nMuch that is excellent in Contact\nImprovisation is the result of omis-\nsions-avoiding injury, for instance,\nyet allowing moments of instability\nwhile playing with powerful physical\nforces. Omit jarring the body, mis-\ncommunication, physical confusion,\nwillful accomplishment. These omis-\nsions are about survival.\nSurvival may be taken for granted\nby audiences. The performer of CI is\nnot so phlegmatic. The notion that CI\nperformance is 'ungenerous', as audi-\nences have observed, results from CI\nperformers paying close attention to\nlife and limb. If the audience feels\nneglected due to lack of eye contact,\nfor instance, they might consider that\nin CI training peripheral, non-focussed\nvision is employed. This is very awk-\nward socially (try it at a party) but\ncreates a state of mind in which vision\nis not paramount, for once, in the sen-\nsory spectrum of the performer. Mass\nis therefore more clearly sensed, as is\npositioning and change.\nAudiences of televised sports are\naccustomed to seeing athletes prepar-\ning for their tasks, and watching them\nwork (play). These performers are\nprimed to make unusual efforts and\nwe watch the results of their play\nknowing what they are attempting to\ndo, and, with some, we understand\nhow they hope to do it-an empathy\nborn of knowing the rules of the situa-\ntion. I believe knowing the premises\nof CI creates a similar empathy, but\nthe spectator must become used to the\nidea that a Form which is proposing to\ndeal with improvisation formally,\nrather than being goal-oriented or\naesthetically based, requires some other\nsort of empathy-perhaps that of the\nnaturalist on a ramble. It is the mi.tu-\nralist who organizes the view into\nforms. The river will not speak of\ngravity n·or surface tension nor subsur-\nface currents. These are attributes for\nthe naturalist to infer. The birds signal\ntheir intent to the other birds. The\nnaturalist is eavesdropping. Birds just\nbird. The naturalist must bird along.\nIn short, theatrical forms rely\nmostly on contrast and conflict. CI\ndepends on communication and co-\noperation.\nSports rely on conflicting goals and\n'plays'. CI has no point-system and\nthe maneuvers are relatively unpre-\ndictable.\nDance has visual aesthetics, Cl has\naccepted a much more 'general look'.\nIt just happens. Its subsurface currents\nmust be inferred.\nI suppose we are asking audiences\nto look in unusual ways, but what of\nthat? Every medium requires a shift\nof focus, every culture. Even every\nday. I would like an audience of\nSherlock Holmeses who would discern\nthe interpersonal currents, understand\nthe dialogue, and maintain a stance of\nno blame, even in the face of the guilty\nperformer who could not fulfill his\nown idea1s in performance.\nI gather from what I have written\nthat I do not see the audience-perform-\ner relationship as one where the per-\nformer has a duty to the audience. I\nsee it as a relationship where they have\na relationship with each other, and if\nthe audience may have expectations of\nthe performer, well, so may the per-\nformer have expectations of the audi-\nence. You no doubt get the drift. \"It\nmatters what you give an audience to\ndo\" (Christie Svane). \"Art criticism is\nfor artists as ornithology is for the\nbirds\" (Barnett Newman).",

    "Text": "In July of 1980, Rita Ossi partici-\npated in a contact workshop with me\nin Venice, Italy, for rehabilitation ther-\napists and others interested in Contact\nas a therapeutic matrix, and thus began\na fruitful collaboration which contin-\nues to enrich our respective fields of\ninterest.\nRita was then doing psychotherapy\nfor a public health service, helping\nlong-term patients become autonomous\nand reintegrated into the society. What\nmost preoccupied her about these pa-\ntients was the sense of expropriation\nthat their bodies had suffered, the lack\nof care for themselves physically, and\ntheir fear or inability to adequately re-\nlate to others. She found that only by\ndirect means and experience-body\nwork-was it possible to improve their\nself-concept.\nAs Rita continued to study Contact\nwith me in Rome, she found the con-\ncepts of Contact Improvisation star-\ntlingly powerful (even if some she had\npreviously encountered in Reich,\nLowen, Perls, and Feldenkrais): estab-\nlish contact with yourself and others,\nturn yourself upside down, feel weight\nand energy, perceive and occupy space,\ngive and receive weight (physically and\npsychologically!), understand where\nthe fears knot up inside. Each of us\nfrom her own starting point was con-\nvinced of the therapeutic value of\ncontact.\nSo last summer in Treviso, we held\na workshop together. Most partici-\npants said that their primary reason for\nwanting to experiment with Contact\nwas to widen their movement experi-\nence. Little by little as we worked, we\nnoted that everyone found the work\npsychically therapeutic also.\nThe workshop begins. After a brief\nintroduction, I start some Contact ex-\nercises: with the floor, with various\nbody parts, with space, weight, with\nanother's body (with and not against).\nIt is for them both an exploration and\na discovery, a putting into focus, a\nunion and a clash with their own sen-\nsations and postural habits.\nWe go on to balances, somersaults\nand other upside down movements,\nfeeling weight and energy, trying active\nand passive roles. There are moments\nwhen people seem confused because\nthey are feeling new sensations, coor-\ndinations never before explored, rela-\ntionships up to this point barely recog-\nnized; and there are other magic mo-\nments in which the movement flows\nas dance and everyone perceives the\nfusion of mind and body.\nWhen someone in the group encoun-\nters an apparently insurmountable dif-\nficulty, we stop. I try diversi:: physical\napproaches. Rita mentions the sym-\nbolic significance the movement might\nexpress, the psychological valence of\nthat individual or group difficulty.\nShe tries not to be categorical but pro-\nposes various hypotheses, interpreta-\ntions which each can then investigate\nfor himself.\nShe gives some examples: not being\nable to give one's own weight or take\nanother's may mean lack of confidence,\nfearfulness, mistrustfulness of others,\nrigidity in relationships; holding the\nhead and neck stiff perhaps means\nwanting to control everything ration-\nally; holding the legs, especially in\ncouple work, could mean fear of sex-\nual invasion, etc ....\nMemories of old traumas arise,\nconsciousness of habits (postural and\npsychic) taken on at particular times\nin one's life, fears that have never been\novercome.\nWhen, on the last day, we put to-\ngether sound and movement-roaring-\nthere is a moment of panic. Broken,\nheld sounds come out and they sudden-\nly realize that these sounds open a new\nrealm of the body. Eagerly and at\nlength they work on the impasse.\nAt the end of every day, Rita and I\ndiscussed the work accomplished, in\nwhat manner each participant had\nshown us something of himself. We\nexamined our impressions of their per-\nsonalities, their problems. The follow-\ning day I proposed exercises relating to\nwhat had emerged, integrating this\nwork into the general development of\nthe workshop. And so the workshop\nwas guided by psychological as well as\nphysical considerations. The therapeu-\ntic effect was confirmed by the parti-\ncipants themselves in our final discus-\nsion when they talked of their sense of\nwell being and physical pleasure, and\nalso of awareness, each at his own level,\nof \"dark areas\", of the lack of accept-\nance of parts of their bodies, and of the\npossibility of accepting those parts and\nbetter integrating them.\nRita and I had decided not to com-\nment specifically but generally, to al-\nlow the experience itself to bring even-\ntual insights.\nRita has been able to verify, even in\nother situations, that the discovery of\ncertain personality disturbances, if it\nhappens in the body, with its own reac-\ntions and sensations, is more quickly\nrecognized and can provoke more radi-\ncal changes than an analytic psycho-\ntherapy based exclusively on words\nwhich often mask, color, and dilute\nsignificance and change.\nCertainly Contact is a dance form,\nfull of life and expression, but we\nmaintain that it can be used also as an\nefficient psychotherapy, or better, as\n\"body therapy\". Both in Italy and\nAmerica where present physical fads\ntend towards negation of the body\nrather than self-discovery, we would\nlike to see Contact better known and\nused. f!\nI would be very interested to know\nif and what anyone else is doing with\nthe therapeutic aspects of Contact\nwork.

    "Text": "Last summer in Boulder, Larry\nFagin told me about an exer-\ncise he gave his poetics students\nas a lesson in improvisation: Go to a\nmovie in the middle. Sit down and\nwatch. As soon as you've figured out\nwhat's going on, get up and leave.\nFor me too, improvisation is a prac-\ntice in disorientation-training the\nreflexes to read confusion as a challenge\nnot a threat; that a moment cut loose\nfrom its moorings has the advantage of\nbeing able to move in any direction,\nand further, that a temporary absence\nof reference points can clear the way\nfor impulses from unexpected quarters.\nIn the past few years, disorientation\nhas reemerged as a central theme for me\nin teaching & practicing Contact Im-\nprovisation and in performing improvi-\nsation. What began as a physical survi-\nval skill for Contact, has become for\nme a keystone-not only for the survi-\nval of the bodies in contact, but for the\nvitality & heart of the improvisation.\nOne of the earliest exercises in\nphysical disorientation for Contact\nImprovisation, and still at the heart of\nthe work for me, is Steve Paxton's\n'small dance of standing'. Relaxing\nerect, the intelligence of the body is\nrevealed as it fires the appropriate\nmuscles just enough to keep the body\nmass hovering within range of its verti-\ncal supports. The micromovements\nthat occur to keep me balanced are so\ntiny and yet so magnified, and arise\nfrom such a deep feeling of stillness\nand space, that I get giddy, tickled by\nthe impossible. magnitude of such subtle\nsensations. The disorientation in the\nstand comes from the feeling that in-\nside the apparent solidity and stillness\nof standing, there is nothing but move-\nment and space! Each time, I come to\nfeel as precarious standing on the floor\non two legs as I might on one leg on a\ntrampoline.\nWithout the willingness to risk one's\npoint of view, to be temporarily at a\nloss, improvising can become a sleepy\nexercise in restating what's already\nperfectly clear. When nothing is really\nat stake, one's survival is assured, but\nsome deeper satisfaction, both as a\nwatcher and as a performer, is lacking.\nBut it's tricky keeping the cutting\nedge sharp-the body/mind adapts\nincredibly fast to unfamiliar circum-\nstances. What is attempted and survived\nwith hesitation the first time, is ap-\nproached with more courage the next,\nuntil soon it is done automatically.\nAfter awhile the real challenge changes\nfrom 'how can I survive this disorienta-\ntion' to 'where do I find the next one?'.\nIt's easy to come into the middle of\na movie if you know when it's scheduled\nto end. There's an added mystery to\nthe middle when the duration isn't\nknown. I love the performances of\nimprovisation that end themselves.\nWhen a simple gesture, delivered with\nevery intention of being followed by\nanother, leaves you unexpectedly\nfinished. Realizing you're home, dizzy,\ndelighted, you say goodnight.\nBut most of the time it's the per-\nformers that choose when to end. And\nthey have their preferences-sorne tend\nto end on an upswing, others at a climax,\nor just after, while some prefer to fade\naway over the horizon of some long\nplateau. I used to have a bad habit of\nending things too early-just when the\nsubstance of the thing was about to\ncome through. Once a form was recog-\nnized, I thought it was complete. In\nmy dances, I was constantly changing\nthe subject, interrupting with a new\nthought, a new dynamic, a shift in\nfocus. From years of watching and\ndancing with other improvisors, I slowly\nlearned how and why to stay with\nthings a little longer-that a form has\nsubstance as well as shape, and to get\nto the substance, you have to penetrate\nthe form. Recognizing the form gives\nyou somewhere to start, but it's the\nsubstance that gives you depth.\nI'm still learning that lesson. Both\nContact Improvisation and Contact\nQuarterly have now passed their ten\nyear mark. Regularly, I sense the end\napproaching, of my engagement and\ncuriosity with these forms. I feel too\nwell-oriented and begin to think I've\nfigured it our. But through the work\nitself and my partners in it, I've learned\na little patience, at least enough to keep\nfinding out that what appears to be the\nend, isn't. As it turns out, I'm still in\nthe middle.",

Smitten as I was\nby the enlivened state it had the capacity to induce, for a\nlong time it seemed to me that the form existed totally in-\ndependent of our insatiable pursuit of it. It gave but didn't\nneed.\nI've since come to realize that the freedom improvisation\noffers doesn't come without bidding. Its pleasure is a disci-\npline. In the practice of Contact Improvisation, one is con-\nstantly faced with one's tendency to make the same choices\nover and over again. Within the form, this tendency is\ncountered by working in close contact with a partner who\nis in a position to remind you that there are options you\nhadn't considered. Appreciating that invitation is one of\nthe basic challenges improvising offers.\nI've also come to realize that it's possible to practice the\nphysical techniques of Contact Improvisation and never\nmake the choice to improvise. ls it because one hasn't been\nshown the possibility, doesn't see it, or simply doesn't\nchoose it?\nThough they greatly encouraged it, it was not only the\nclimate of the '70s, nor the improvisational forms it gave\nrise to that enabled us to appreciate the value of staying\nopen to unexpected possibilities. The potential for open-\nness is human, and can be chosen and actively cultivated\nany time, by any individual, through any form. It is the\ndesire for it that makes it possible.

    "Text": "Dear Nancy,\nI appreciated your Editor Note last\nissue, \"Dealing with the Heat,\" {CQ\nIX 3, Fall 1984], because I too, have\nbegun to see value in the friction of\nopposition. I have felt my tendency to\nharmonize conflict in so many aspects\nof my life, from social interaction to\nsimply how I reside in my own tissue.\nAnd lately, I have been exploring in\nboth my personal life and my dancing\nthe parts of myself that I had dismissed\nby omitting 'no's, by resolving differ-\nences rather than feeling the heat of\nthe friction. I perceive that there is so\nmuch ~o be gained in this exploration\nand thmk that it applies to much of\nwhat I have experienced with Contact\nImprovisation.\nTo engage in conflict one must be\nwilling to draw upon the passionate\ncharge that emanates from one's\n\"guts'', tapping the heart of the mat-\nter. I am only beginning to appreciate\nthe value of this juice. I have avoided\nit out of fear of sounding unreasonable\nor being too ego bound. Now I see it\nas a beautiful force that can orient me\ntoward knowing-viscerally-my sense\nof purpose.\nI see the basic aesthetic of Contact\nas one of merging with natural forces,\ngoing with the flow, and experiencing\nunion with both our partner and a\nprocess of engaging the physical laws\nof nature. Asserting control, saying\nn_o to this_ union, or establishing a dis-\ntinct self m the dance is generally not\ndone. As we continue to explore the\nmysterious beauties of the original\naesthetic, I'm curious about how Con-\ntact will change if we bring more of\nourselves to the dance, if our relation-\nships include difference and separation\nas well as union, personal passion as\nwell as the impersonal play of weight\nand balance.\nI see the orientation in Contact Im-\nprovisation toward harmony and pro-\ncess as an important voice on a leading\nedge of our culture, evidence of some-\nthing more spontaneous and essential\nin dance and relationships than the\nsuperficial and goal oriented nature of\nmuch of our world. And I see the in-\ncorporation of conflict and passions\nas an important passage if Contact is\ngoing to continue to be a valuable so-\ncial force.\nIn order to discuss this point and to\noffer a perspective on Contact Improv-\nisation in relation to our culture I'd\nlike to share some of the work o'f\nCharley Johnston, M.D. He is a psychi-\natrist with a recently completed book,\nThe Creative Imperative, about a model\nof all creative processes, from artistic\nendeavors to the process of developing\na relationship, to developmental shifts\nover a lifetime, to cultural change and\nthe creation of civilization . . . He sees\nsimilar structural shifts through all of\n~hes_e processes as they grow. Although\n1t will be unfortunately oversimplified,\nI'll describe the gist of this model in\norder to offer a point of view on Con-\ntact Improvisation's relationship to our\ncurrent culture and on Contact's own\ndevelopment.\n. The basic pattern Dr.Johnston ~es\nm all creative process, all of life, is from\nformlessness/essence/mystery into\nform/manifestation/materialization and\nthen into an integration process that\neventually embraces both the struc-\nture and the essence. In other words,\n~rom oneness into twoness, from unity\n~nto separatwn, from what is archetyp-\nically fei:nale mto archetypically male,\nfrom universal and spiritual into mater-\nial and intellectual; and then into inte-\ngratwn. He _divides these three stages\nmto five which I'll call: 1) Pre-stage,\n2) Early Stage, 3) Middle Stage, 4) Late\nStage, 5) Integration.\nI'll describe each stage with exam-\npl~s o~ developments in an art project,\na ltfenme, and culture. It is important\nto note that each shift into the next\nstage reflects a transformation into an\nentirely different paradigm or system\nof values. And each transformation is\na quantum leap into a larger capacity\nfor experiencing aliveness, for being\nable to handle and even enjoy existing\namongst unknowns.\nPre-stage\nThis is a gestalting time, a time of\nunity, before one is particularly aware\nof a cr.eative direction beginning to dif-\nferen t1ate from this womb of possibili-\nty. In a lifetime, it is prenatal experi-\nence and early infancy, when the child\nbonds with parent. Culturally, it is the\ntime when life is ordered by connection\nwith nature-a powerful and mysteri-\nous ~orce. One lived within the unity\nof tnbe which was inseparable from\nnature and her cycles.\nEarly Stage .\nThe early stage is the time df inspir-\nation, the spontaneous possibility of\nessence taking form, the first notion of\ndirection in creating a work of art. It\nis childhood, a time of fantasy. It is\nthe time when cultures moved from\ntribal nature to the sophistication we\nassociate with the early Greeks, the\nAztecs, and Ancient Zimbawe. Basi-\ncally, life is still experienced as a mys-\nterious force of which we are in awe\nand by which we are totally influenced.\nMany of the special beauties of Con-\ntact Improvisation are reflections of\nthis stage. We dance with spontaneity\nand participate in an often magical\nprocess that is larger than ourselves\nindividually. Culturally, this is a spir-\nitual time. Zen emerged from a culture\nat this stage. Not until the next stage\ndo we become more personal, more\npassionate.\nMiddle Stage\nAs the first shapings of inspiration\ntake enough form, they begin to chal-\nlenge their source, their essence, for\nattention and belief. Here, distinction\nbecomes very important. But not for\nempirical insight-that comes in the\nlate stage. Instead, attention goes to\ndistinguishing right from wrong, good\nfrom bad. As a work of art moves in-\nto more formedness, the original\nsource acts as a sort of quality control\ncontinually questioning the integrity\nof the emerging form. At the same\ntime, the urge to form must continual-\nly forge ahead or it will be swallowed\nby doubt. In a lifetime, it is the time\nof adolescence. In the polarization of\nforces arises a personal and even moral\ncharge, a strength to know your posi-\ntion and stand up for it. (Sound famil-\niar?) In Western Culture, the middle\nstage began at the birth of monotheism\nand continued through the middle\nages. A result of that time was the cre-\nation of polarized social roles, e.g.:\naristocracy and peasantry, male and\nfemale differentiation, and Christians\nand heretics.\nIf we create a context in our Con-\ntact Improvisation gatherings that en-\ncourages people to engage in polarized\nrelationships, then I'd say that the de-\nvelopment of Contact as a whole is\nmoving from the early stage into the\nmiddle stage. In my recent past, I have\nfelt that emotional tension was a prob-\nlem in a Contact class or Jam. It is\nuseful to me to see the value of this\nstage rather than worry about conflicts\nshattering the unified foundation we\nhave built. Actually, participation in\nthis realm can create a capacity to\nmeet one another in more ways.\nLate Stage\nIn creating a work of art, the late\nstage is the time when attention goes\nto detailing the form and polishing the\nsurface, now that the original source\nhas taken satisfactory shape. In a life-\ntime, it is early adulthood when one is\nmore oriented toward establishing\noneself materialistically in culture.\nWith the age of reason and into the\nindustrial revolution, Western Culture\nshifted into the late stage. The forces\nof nature no longer appeared as a\nthreat as we separated ourselves and\nfocused on our capacity to control our\nenvironment. We have developed elab-\norate structures both materially and\nintellectually.\nWe live in a culture that is in the\nmidst of this stage. Aspects of Con·\ntact certainly reflect it: we have a\nhighly articulate language for addres-\nsing the skills of Contact-a surprising-\nly mechanical language of weights and\nlevers, when actually the essence of\nContact is union with natural forces\nand diminishing our effort to control.\nIntegration\nThe next stage, integration, is re-\nflected by the leading edge of our cul-\nture. The essence of this stage is most\napparent to me as I think of those peo-\nple who, as they age, become sagelike.\nThey come to gradually encompass all\nof the stages-they appreciate the mys-\ntery of life as well as the passions while\nmaintaining facility with the intellec-\ntual and material aspects. With a work\nof art, this is when the work is com-\nplete and the artist becomes separate\nfrom it. Even though you may have\ncreated it, it will be quite a while be-\nfore it is understood. Now it becomes\na distinct entity with the capacity to\nteach even you who created it. I see\nContact Improvisation as an aspect of\nWestern Culture's movement into inte-\ngration. I think it emerged as a coun-\nterswing from the materialistic direc-\ntion of our culture. It has served me\nwell in this regard. It has given me a\ntaste of community while all I had\nknown was transience. It has taught\nme about shedding of ego to enjoy the\ndance beyond my control; there truly\nis something to be trusted as alive with-\nout willful effort to make it happen.\nThese are rather foreign notions to the\ngoal oriented lifestyle of America in\nthe twentieth century. But what about\nthe twenty-first century?\nUltimately, integration is more than\na counterswing. Contact rather success-\nfully synthesized the mysterious, the\nmore unformed and core aspects of the\nearly stage with the articulate, discern-\ning, and mechanical aspects of the late\nstage. But in this time of overstated\nglory for the intellect, I see much more\nvalue in engaging the heat of difference\nthan for ideological articulation. In the\nsame way that revitalizing the teachings\nof ancient prophets has been so mean-\ningful to expand our capacity for living\nsanely in these seemingly insane times,\nI think we have much to gain in re-\nclaiming the personal juice that is a\npowerful part of the uniqueness of each\nof us. I am excited to experience the\npotential embodiment of the charge of\npassions in myself and in connection\nwith Contact Improvisation as it grows\nwith me and with all of us. What will\nthese changes be?\nThanks Nancy, for all of your work\nwith the Quarterly and sharing your\ngrowing edge.\nSincerely,\nKris Wheeler\nSeattle, WA\nSept. 21, 1984",

    "Text": "Seven years ago, while doing a\nContact Improvisation duet, I was\nstopped short by a movement I made\nthat wasn't mine. \"Hey Lisa,\" I called\nto her from across the studio, \"I just\ndid your movement.\" \"Let's see,\" she\nsaid, as I rewound my sensations and ·\ntried to do it again. Recognizing her\nidiosyncratic timing, she laughed and\nsuggested I keep \"doing her.\" My part-\nner was willing, so we continued as I\ntried to put myself in Lisa's skin, in her\nnervous system, and dance. Instead of\nmy usual moderated flow, I jerked and\nflinched, turning abruptly, plummeting\nhalfway to the floor and stopping, pull-\ning my arms back like a chicken and\nmaking tiny darting birdlike movements\nat unexpected moments. \"Whoa,\" I\nsaid, wanting to stop, \"this is too weird.\"\nWhat made me stop was the eery sensa-\ntion of being in someone else's body\nand in their time. My choices, reac-\ntions, directions and timings were total-\nly foreign to me, but at the same time\nvery familiar. I learned them from\ndancing with Lisa.\nThere are many ways to learn some-\none's dance. In this case, I learned it\nthrough the skin. Dancing in physical\ncontact with a partner is a lot like put-\nting your ear to a wall and having a\nconversation with someone on the other\nside of it. Like the sounds in the next\nroom, your movements and your part-\nner's are amplified by the contact, and\nvery little goes unregistered, even if\nunconsciously. In Contact, skin to skin,\nweight to weight, you're moved by your\npartner's movements and in this way\nable to feel their reflexes, the rush and\npause of their time, first hand. In Alex-\nander Neascu's article in this issue, he\ntalks of a new kind of time called 'in-\nternal time' recently identified by post-\nmodern physicists. I think it might be\nthis kind of time-one that moves ac-\ncording to its own intrinsic logic and\nphrasing, not according to the standard\nclock-time divisions-that is communi-\ncated during Contact Improvisation.\nIn \"doing Lisa\" I was further struck\nby the fact that although these were all\nmovements I could physically do, they\nwere not ones I would ordinarily choose.\nI had been under the assumption that\nin improvising I was calling on any and\nevery movement I could possibly make,\nbut now I realized I was in fact doing a\nvery limited and consistent range of\nmovements, textures and timings. That\nI was, in fact, always \"doing myself.\"\nI found this a rather humbling and re-\nvealing discovery.\nLooking back from here, the oddest\npart to me is how disappointed I was\nto realize I was only \"doing myself\"\nwhen I danced-as if I should have been\nable to do more.\nWhat more was there to do, one\nmight ask. Well, Contact Improvisation\nfor one thing. Obviously one can only\ndo Contact, or anything else for that\nmatter, in one's own way, but I was so\nbusy looking at Contact Improvisation,\nI didn't notice myself doing it. I was\ntoo busy subjecting myself to \"the\nforces\"-of gravity, momentum, iner-\ntia, etc.-to notice what kind of subject\nI was. And I was taken aback to even\nconsider it.\nWithin the study of Contact, the\nexperience of \"flow\" was soon recog-\nnized and highlighted in our dancing.\nIt became one of my favorite practices\nand I proceeded to \"do flow\" for many\nyears-challenging it, testing it: Could\nwe flow through this pass? Could we\nsqueak through that one, and keep\ngoing?\nI used to have a partner that I called\nthe Flow Machine. His considerable\nmass streamed through the channels of\nmovement, sometimes like a rushing\nbrook, sometimes like molten lava, but\nalways ongoing. I would get euphoric\nand giddy as the end of the phrase never\narrived-always there was a new curve,\nand we'd bank off the edge of that one,\ngoing on and on. There is great pleasure\nin this. And it is in large measure\nthrough establishing and maintaining",

    "Text": "For the last month I've been going down to\nWesleyan University on Fridays to teach two l '12 hour\nclasses in Contact Improvisation. Though I've been liking\nthe students a great deal, I've been grumbling a lot during\nthe week about the classes being too short. But now the\ngrumbling is bothering me more than the shortness of the\nclasses, so it's time to look into the whole ordeal.\nThe whole ordeal is about time, not enough of it, or\nmore specifically, not enough of a certain kind of it.\nWhen I teach beginning Contact Improvisation, there\nare a few principles I come back to over and over-some\nfor safety reasons, others for flavor. Some have to do with\nexpanding one's orientation to space-experiencing space\nas spherical, dealing with disorientation, being able to fall,\nroll, and ride momentum, alone and in physical contact\nwith another mover. I suppose this could be called spatial\nconditioning.\nThen there's time conditioning, which I'm just beginning\nto take particular notice of. A lot of the meditations on\nphysical sensation (e.g. Paxton's \"small dance\") that have\nalways been a part of Contact training are actually as much\nabout inducing an experience of expanded time as they are\nabout the physical sensations they point up.\nThis sense of expanded time is a subjective state, one\nwhere time feels mutable and there are slippages-where a\n45 minute dance can feel like 5 minutes, while a 2 second\nfall can feel luxuriously long. It is a relaxed state, one\nwhere time seems to have been released from its inexorable\nunit-to-unit march and allowed to roam in an open field\nwith wide horizons and no fences, a time whose divisions\nand textures vary according to the moods and perceptions\nof the people moving through it.\nAs with spatial training, this new temporal experience\nmay be puzzling at first. All too often you lose your place\nin the dancing, but you find out through experience that\nif you just hang on a few seconds longer (those seconds feel\nlike hours!) your place will come floating up under you like\na pair of lost footprints. You come to trust and in fact look\nforward to those gaps because in them you 're as vulnerable\nand available as you can be, and from there come new per-\nceptions and some of the more surprising and refreshing\nmovement material.\nBut how do we get there from here? Especially when\nwe 're coming in to the studio from Chemistry or Shakes-\npeare or Ballet or a 65 mile drive.\nThe transition from clock time to internal time can\nbegin during the personal warmup-a period of time often\ngiven at the beginning of class to relax and \"arrive,\" to get\nready physically and mentally to dance with others. It\ndeepens during the periods of extended duet improvising.\nAbsorption in the moment expands the feeling of time and\nyou come out of it enlivened no matter where you've been.\nIt's this state of absorption and enlivening that I aim for in\nmy own dancing and teaching.\nI spent the first few weeks at Wesleyan searching in vain\nfor a quick passage, a trap door into this state. But how\ncould I hope to transmit the spaciousness, mutability, and\nmystery of time when I myself was rushing to get in as much\ndancing, skills, improvising, sensitizing, etc. as possible in\nthe 'short' time available?\nExhausted from my struggle with time, I gave up and\nfound that simply by relaxing I created more time. It felt\nlike practicing Aikido, where one redirects an opposing\nforce by first blending with it, not resisting it. Meanwhile,\nof course, as I was internally wrestling with all this, the\nstudents were rolling, giggling, getting dizzy, getting strong,\nconfused, inspired, thinking it was silly, feeling it was\nprofound and in general doing Contact Improvisation. As\nhas often been said, the dancing teaches itself, if the teacher\ncan only get out of the way long enough to let everyone\ndance ....\nP.S. After all this, I still think an hour and a half is too\nshort for a Contact class!",

    "Text": "EUZABETI-1: At the very beginning of a Contact Improvisation workshop,\nteachers often talk about the 'small dance'. Why do _YOU start\nwith the 'small dance'?\nSTEVE: Well, first of all, it's a fairly easy perception: all you have to do\nis stand up and then relax-you know-and at a certain point you real-\nize that you've relaxed everything that you can relax but you're still\nstanding and in that standing is quite a lot of minute movement: .. the\nskeleton holding you upright even though you 're mentally relaxing.\nNow in that very fact of you ordering yourself to relax and yet continuing\nto stand-finding that limit to which you could no further relax without\nfalling down; you 're put in touch with a basic sustaining effort that goes\non constantly in the body, that you don't have to be aware of. It's\nbackground movement static-you know-that you blot out with your\nmore interesting activities, yet it's always there sustaining you. We 're\ntrying to get in touch with these kinds of primal forces in the body and\nmake them readily apparent. Call it the 'small dance' ... It was a name\nchosen largely because it's quite descriptive of the situation and because\nwhile you 're doing the stand and feeling the 'small dance' you 're aware\nthat you 're not 'doing' it, so, in a way, you 're watching yourself perform;\nwatching your body perform its function. And your mind is not figuring\nanything out and not searching for anv answers or being used as an\nactive instrument but is being used as a lens to focus on certain\nperceptions. DC",

    "Text": "Randy Warshaw joins her and soon\nthey seem comfortably connected,\nrolling back and forth across the floor\nat a pace that comes less from one\nbody on top or underneath pushing\nanother, than from the roving point\nwhere the weight of the two bodies\nmeet. There is little eye contact, they\nhardly even face each other. In this\ndancing they don't need their eyes.\nThey're using another kind of sensing,\nan awareness of pressure. The blending\nof their weight gives them the cue. It's\nnot their faces, words or hands but\ntheir backs, the nudge of a shoulder,\nor a turn of a knee that whispers the\ndirections. Even when a spiraling mo-\nmentum separates them, there is a\nkinesthetic sympathy that co-ordinates\nRandy's loop through space with\nNancy's spin and arched back suspen-\nsion so that somehow he is underneath\nto support her when she finally begins\nto fall. This is the kind of crystalline\nmoment that Contact at its best is\nknown for. A physical communication\nthat is so immediate and clear, it\ndoesn't need added words or gestures.\nNina Martin and Danny Lepkoff\ndanced the next prolonged duet in a\nstyle that markedly contrasted Nancy's\nand Randy's. To begin with, they\nfaced each other a lot-they had to.\nFor without the eye contact and the\nfacial signals, their playful barrages\ncould have been seriously dangerous.\nHands that pulled the partner towards\nthemselves in an affectionate manner,\nmight switch tone and jerk the other\nperson away. The two bodies would\nconnect in a hip-check only to propel\noff into separate directions. A lift\ncould lead to a sustained support, or\nthe lifter might just as easily drop his\nburden and walk away.\nThese two dancers seemed to be\nworking from a set of character traits\nthat allowed them to spar lightly with\none another. Although moments and\nmovements suggested a certain aggres-\nsiveness, their flippant attitude and\nlaughter made it clear they were at\nplay. Their spirits were high and the\nquick steps and fast, unexpected\nchanges of direction reminded me of\ncertain sports like basketball where\nthere is a constant shifting of direction\nto outguess your partner-opponent.\nEven though they rarely sustained\na physical connectedness, there was a\ngreat deal of contact energy generated\nbetween them. A line monitored the\nspace between them, a tension came\nout of the constant questioning and\nmaneuvering in their steps. Finally\nthey did meet one time in a thrilling\nlift that had so much momentum, that\nit orbited Nina, who was spiraling on\ntop of Danny's shoulder, and Danny,\nwho was revolving around his own axis,\naround and around the space. A burst\nof cheer and claps greeted them as they\nlanded.\nGood Contact Improvisation can\nhave both the exciting, funny, fierce,\nmimicking, popping energy, as well as\nthe deep awareness of a physical com-\nmunication. The latter leads to the\nformer with skill and patience. But\nwhat I see more and more frequently\nis an immediate jump to the bouncy,\nwitty stuff of dancing. This is an easy\nway to entertain ... for a while. It\ntends, however, to run dry pretty\nquick! y. I think this is because it is\nnot based on the deeper physical\nsource of the dancing, the real connec-\ntion of bodily weight. Sure I like the\npizazz, but I also like the heightened\nawareness that makes vision, words\nand gesture less important than physical\nsensitivity. u",

To meet\nand dance, to exchange material, to discuss and share.\nPeople from different countries-France, Holland, Britain,\nSwitzerland, Finland, Hungary, Germany, United States,\nand Canada. English establishes itself as the first language\nof the group with a continuing translation to French ...\nalready the spoken language suggests its power in group\ninterchange ... and as teachers, language as communicator\nis a concern ... the word vocabulary translated from one\nEuropean language to another gives different meaning/\nimage/association ... and someone mentions the impor-\ntance of non-verbal teaching/learning/communication. -+\n\nLater, people offer their personal histories and some\ninsight into their ways of working and the situations in\ntheir location. A recurring theme is personal explorations\nin movement that give rise to the question, Is this still\nContact?, e.g., exploration of emotions in the dancing;\ninter-connection with other disciplines such as yoga, tai\nchi and Aikido.

Later, reporting back to the\nlarge group, some of the issues brought up:\n\nImportance of observation for learner and for teacher;\nthe consideration that watching may be the beginning of\n\"listening. \"\n\nThe usefulness of demonstration in situations where\npeople are unfamiliar with the work.\n\nThat teaching is a discovery; that people discover for\nthemselves; that change is constant.\n\nTo seek in teaching a process where the joy of move-\nment may be found.\n\nCare to not manipulate whilst directing experiences.\n\nQuestioning how to teach in institutions where the\nContact class is compulsory for the student.\n\nHow to set goals in a given situation.\n\nHow to relate wi.th students' physical pain and injuries\nand mental problems.\n\nHow to work with groups of differing abilities.\n\nTalking about movement seems a more complicated way\nof communication than demonstrating the problem.\n\nHow to be( come) ready in body and mind to lead a class.\n\nAwareness about judging ''good-bad.\"\n\nKnowledge and acceptance of limits and habits, and how\nto work with them.\n\nState of mind and how that changes.\n\nIntegration of solo experience into contact?\n\nWorking with imagery; shifting from inside-focussed\nactivity to outside-focussed activity. How to teach that?\n\nIs there a way of experiencing weight (the first times) and\nnot get stuck in heaviness?\n\nIs \"weight\" a state of mind?\n\nHow to create an atmosphere in a class.\n\nTeacher is reminder for physical memory.\n\nCan we be specific and still be improvising?\n\nHow can we share our \"knowledge,\" experiences?\n\nAm I still dancing while teaching?\n\nNot necessarily emphasize difference between \"begin-\nners\" and \"advanced, \".but creating structures that have\nexchange happening.\n\nAt the beginning: important not to shock sensations of\nbody, but to build trust and confidence. Using awareness\nof body-architecture.\n\nHow (when) to introduce subtle work like small-dance\nor stillness-work?\n\nImprovisation: the most obscure but most interesting\nquestion in teaching.\n\nShifting activities while teaching: supervising, observing,\ndancing, sensing, talking ... ·\n\nPreparation: Nancy-\"! make some notes,. makes me freer\nto go in and to abandon whatever I planned. Can be a kind\nof anchoring . .. Detours are often the most interesting . .. \"\n\nTeaching, what? Our personal concerns?\n\nMoving with a partner: what's the range of communication?\n(Contact and sexuality, Contact and emotions . .. )\n\nWhere is the heart of Con tact Improvisation? Where\nare the borders from which it spreads and exchanges?\n\nStressing the exploration of the form in teaching.\n\nWorking in an isolated situation (or location) can\nbecome a strength: challenging the development of\npersonal ways to dance/teach.\n\nTo give and take weight, fun, security, moving effortlessly,\nconfidence, unknown, open attitude, curiosity, the search,\nextension, space (inner and outer), falling, relating with\nground, molecular dancing, elasticity of centre, transport,\ntravelling, inter-dependence, support, energy, rhythm,\nbalancing, momentum.\n\nThe afternoon is spent in trio feedback structure (2\ndancers, 1 watcher, 20 minutes dancing/watching, 10\nminutes giving and receiving feedback/discussion, then\nswitching roles, so all get to dance and to watch).\n\nTEACHING EXCHANGE\n\nSATURDAY begins with spontaneous warming up and\ndancing.\n\nThe teaching exchange started with a discussion of\nareas where people wanted to work-personal experiments,\nideas, difficulties, etc. We soon became involved in the\nsubject of being in the air. .\n\nThe initial question was how to use the force which\ntakes you away from center (centrifugal force) to meet\nyour partner again, and transfer that force into weight\nexchange?\n\nHere is an excerpt from the ensuing discussion:\n\nNancy: Maybe there's another way to approach from the\nair that asks the other person to join your force-how do\nyou join it, how do you read it so that you can work with\nit? To me it has to do with reading the movement before\nit gets to you so you can join with it. So coming through\nthe air from different places, poses different problems to\nsolve in terms of forces, momentum.\n\nSuzanne: How to stay flexible and open, to be able to\nread that movement when it comes with so mu-ch forc;e?\n\nNancy: How to keep dancing in the air? People sometimes\nthrow themselves in the air, and then lose their sensitivity\nwhile their partner just works with them. They are trying\nto hold themselves together in the air and that makes it\nheavy. They are not really there, they just want to get\ndown.\n\nKaren: The place where you are being supported is a little\nbit small, it's not like the floor ...\n\nMark: What about big men, I'm not used to relaxing in\nthat position.\n\nNancy: A lot of it has to do with if you're willing and\nready to fall frum any height, because if you 're completely\ndependent on your partner or passive, you're in a funny\nposition anyway.\n\nKaren: It takes time when you're up there to get used to\nthat, too, and to try to fall, in different directions.\n\nNancy: Also, when you're lifting someone who is big, to\nfeel that it's okay to let them go, that you can start and\nfollow through somehow without feeling that you have to\nhold them up there-otherwise you don't even stlut, cause\nyou think it's too much.\n\nMoniek: One step before this ... what kind of easy exer-\ncises can stimulate this process-like rolling-for people\nwho don't have much experience?\n\nNancy: Falling is good, because falling is moving through\nthe air with gravity, and if people get comfortable with\nfalling, on the other side of the fall is something that comes\nup. Falling gives you a force in an upward direction. It also\nmakes you unafraid to go down. The down goes up and the\nup goes down, so if you can get the down part ...\n\nJaap: I'm interested in the problems of big men dancing\nwith small women. When I'm going up I often feel the\nsupport collapses.\n\nElinor: It's usually the men that don't want to give their\nweight to the women. They think they are too heavy.\n\nNancy: Sometimes I find with heavier people who are\nafraid to give their weight, that they don't give their center.\nThe center is off to the side so I can't get under it to sup-\nport it and then they think, \"Yeah, see? Well they can't\nsupport me\" and so ... they just keep the problem going.\nThere are some men who are really quite large, and they\ngive their center and the weight stays alive and even if it's\na lot of weight you really can work with it a little bit. And\nthey feel secure and you feel secure, which leads to less\ntension and thus more 'levity.' There's an exercise I\ndo sometimes, it's a climbing exercise and if it goes slow\nenough you can feel and find your skeletal support.\nThere's no momentum involved and it's not particularly\nlight, it's quite heavy. But in the heaviness you find where\nthe weight can be supported and how it feels. Then later\nwhen there's a little momentum it's lighter and you know\nwhere the places are, where you can go to support the\nweight (or be supported well).\n\nMark: Even if I go up, it's already become a habit that I\ndon't stay very long, so I never hang out there.\n\nJaap: I'm finding out that it's not the point to stay very\nlong, it's not the point that you're going up, the point is\nthat you're moving and you happen to be up.\n\nMark: But I'm talking about a technical level, as far as\nknowing what that is, to be suspended in the air. I know\nmuch less about it than you guys.\n\nNancy: Maybe something to do is just hang out up there\nfor one extra second. Again, it's like working with any --'*\n\nlimit-because it's a rhythm, up and down, up and down ..\nso you're just stretching or,opening the limit a little bit\ninstead of 'how can I really stay so long' but just two\nmore seconds and see what happens.\n\nJaap: But there's one point-like when I'm dancing with\nJaana for example, she's small, and when she's on me I\nhave a lot of places for support, and when I'm on her she\nis really so small!!\n\nNancy: People who are good supports really know how to\nuse the movement continually for support as well as\nsurfaces. There's really very little that the person up there\nhas to do because there's so much riding the movement\nthat's happening-with the little shifts to get around the\nshoulders, etc. Sometimes I really feel juggled by people.\nIt's not 'cause they're strong but it's all the little stuff\nthat they're doing. I want to learn to do that more. (To\nKaren) You work with a man about your size so you 're\nquite equal in your weight support, which is a great oppor-\ntunity, because sometimes women don't lift small women\neither for very long, because they're not used to having\nsomeone up there very long.\n\nIn the afternoon we had the actual teaching exchange.\nThe mats were out and first Karen had us practicing Aikido\nbreakfalls. Then Nancy led us in some light disorientation\npractice and we went on to jumping on people who were\nposts, approaching from the air and reaching your partner\nwhile still in that light state.\n\nDuring this session one question came up which seems\nessential to Contact teaching: When working on skills, does\nteaching specific movements or exercises have the same\nresult as teaching a principle and improvising within that\nprinciple? How can you teach people to improvise if\nnot by letting them find their own forms and ways to do\nthings?\n\nLater on, Mark led a class which encompassed focussed\nduets as well as a dynamic group dance with brief and\nchanging encounters. Focus: dancing with different people\nwhile still maintaining awareness of your original partner's\ncenter, then coming back to dancing with the original part-\nner with an awareness of the group.\n\nSuzanne led an experiment which was about accumulat-\ning energy and force during a common stillness in the\ndance, while still in physical contact ... until the accumu-\nlated force releases into movement through space.\n\nLater, watching \"Magnesium\" and \"Chute\" videos\nevokes a sense of history.\n\nPost-dinner networking discussion brings us to the\npublication of a European Newsletter and the setting up\nof a European Jam.\n\nDISCUSSION ABOUT NETWORKING\n\nWhat is the reason for networking?\n\nNeeds, desires could be divided in:\n\n• To keep informed about the places where Contact is\nbeing developed: classes, workshops, performances,\naddresses, dates.\n\n• To know possibilities to meet and to dance with other\nContact dancers. Includes: knowing places and dates\nwhere and when Contact is going on; organizing Jams\nin Europe. Mark Tompkins reported about the experiences\nwith the first European Jam in summer 1982 in the country-\nside of Southern France, organized by L'Atelier Contact.\nImportant points were the necessity of good space and\nsleeping accomodations; costs (admission fee to cover space\nand organization, then there's room and board, and travel\ncost at the individual's expense!). Suzanne, Jean and\nJoanna offered to set up a Jam near Paris around the 1st\nof May.\n\n• To exchange about teaching and research in Contact.\nPossibilities: To invite another teacher to your studio.\nTo continue with this Conference once a year. Important\nconsiderations: Who will organize the next one? The\nnecessity of good housing. Costs as mentioned above plus\npossibly the fee for inviting a special teacher (the presence,\nguidance and knowledge of Nancy was very inspiring and\nsupporting). The length of this conference was generally\nconsidered too short.\n\nTo deal with these aspects brought up the idea of starting\na Newsletter. We should be clear about its aims: If it\nshould be to inform each other in a central way; or if it\nshould be a way of sharing experiences and exchanging\nways of working. We ~ecided to choose for the way to\ninform each other, and to leave the sharing of the work\nto the Contact Quarterly. Organizational agreements:\n\n• Type your own letter (one page) with information\nabout your teaching and up-coming events in your area.\n\n• Each time there should be a coordinator.\n\n• Two issues a year to coordinate with CQ deadline so it\ncan be a part of the magazine.\n\n• Send money to the next coordinator if you'd like to\nreceive a copy (or else it cannot be made and sent).\n\nWe finished the conference realizing the NETWORK\nIS A FACT! -tt\n[More news from this Newsletter and deadline information for the\nnext one can be found in the CQ Newsletter in this issue./",

Eventually I'm moving the walls and the space between the walls.\nMe, as a centering organ, as a source of strength. (One powerful enough command and I would fly up,\nstraight to the ceiling.)\nWhat I really do is hard to explain. I'm the centre of the space around me alright, and also of everything\nelse, moving in that space. And it sometimes feels like it's me who makes it to move.\nI know of course, it's me who's moving, but something inside my skull stays steady, in one place, never\nshoving out of place ... however much I'm going upside down, through whatever angles. In fact, the more\nangles I'm making, the more steady th is one part of me becomes. And the more steady this observing part\nof me is, the better I can make the world around me move.\nIt's an interesting discovery. My body no longer distracted, because my organs no longer protest against\nevery leap I make. There is an adjustment which makes it possible for my mind to follow the body, and for\nmy body to follow the mind.\nMoving around I'm getting closer. Moving around I'm opening up. Getting aware of other people in the\nsame space. Getting aware of other bodies (like mine, but different) moving around (but telling a different\ntale). Getting aware I'm actually moving in space which is shared by all the other bodies in the very same\ntime. And by sharing this space, I'm sharing a conception. I'm sharing a movement, with every echo of it\nrolling between the walls of the space, wherein my body is responding, like a boat on the water.\nEffecting and being effected: my mind, with images. Mildly changing, disturbing changing, or however.\nMy body, in the space. And some of the bodies around me, dancing. With the same mild flow or strangeness\nor confusion. However these waves in this stretch of time flow. And however much a mind is willing to\nallow changes to happen.\nMy steady me is observing this. This part of me is the only part which doesn't let go. It's the part which\nmust lay hidden in layers there are in my brains. It's a part which comes out on those moments/in those\nmovements, when everything else is swimming in the stream. Comprehension. Understanding. Not the\ndetail. Not the current. Not the face that expresses and reveals, but a sort of silent memo. A sentence like:\n\"I was still, no movement at all.\" Which is nothing more than recognizing a situation and accepting the\nabsolute truth of it. Which means that on that moment, there is a balance of forces, focused on the moving\nbody. And the observation of such is the key of control.\nThen my steady part falls back inside its hidingplace and there are only all of my senses left, sprawling in\nthe dance. Dancing with other bodies, all in the same room. Space, time separating. An improvisation\nabout survival.\nGoing around somebody's back, falling down, head first towards the floor, rolling, jumping up. Waiting,\nout of balance. Being out of balance all the time. That's the essence of this dance form.\nTrying to cope with that which moves around you. Trying to grasp a shift of weight. Feeling the floor\nmove away and around. Focusing eyes, sensing ears, balancing feet, flexing spine.\nFinding a way to the end of that rope. Landing on hands and feet. Feeling the ground getting to rest,\nwhile sitting.

    "Text": "At some point in the growth of Contact Improvisation\nthere was a call for definition, rules, a clear way to identify what\nwas (or wasn't) Contact Improvisation. (\"There are no lines,\nonly edges.\" Ansel Adams) Only a few years after its inception,\nContact seemed to be spawning generations of contacters so\nquickly as to be involved in some kind of 'telephone game'.\nJohn tells Sally who shows Sue who passes it on to her brother\nwho tells his wife who shows their kids who bring it to school\nthe next day for recess. If John were walking by the schoolyard\nat noon, would he recognize anything familiar going on in the\nplayground? For all the interest in defining Contact Improv-\nisation, the answer to that quandary is in watching a contact duet\nbetween two dancers who have just met. The definition is in\nthe doing.\nContact bases its language on the natural laws that govern\nmotion (gravity, momentum, inertia, etc.). With these laws as\nour constitution, we have no need for legislation. The natural\nworld enforces its own laws - drop a book, consciously or not,\nand it wil I fall. Clearly, Contact Improvisation is not the begin-\nning or the final stage in the opus that relates the body and its\nmovements to the earth and the other movers on it. The truths\nwe find in Contact, whether basic or elevated, are truths that\nexist with or without Contact Improvisation as a means for re-\nvealing them to us. Often in the enthusiasm of the work it is\npossible to forget that bodies moving in contact are not new.\nIt is, however, the continued focus on the elements involved in\nthat contact, techniques for it, applications of it, that is specific\nto Contact Improvisation.\nMaking a magazine (CQ) for the exchange of information\nand viewpoint instead of making a congress, allowed the various\nsubtexts that existed to emerge and be shared. As a technique\nfor moving together, Contact resonates in the lives of the prac-\ntitioners. Those resonances are personal and varied, and though\nthey enrich the work, the basic practice seems unchanged.\nAfter 6 years, Contact Improvisation continues, with\nor without music, in twos, threes, in groups with a name or with-\nout. Contacters have gathered in bodies, regional families, to\ncorroborate and continue. A context has developed similar to\nsocial dancing wherein people can come together and 'jam'.\nTiirnugh Contact Quarterly a network exists, making known\nplaces where Contact can be found. When a poker player comes\ninto a new town, he looks for the game.",

    "Text": "The state or space created in\nthe workshop setting decreases\nthe stimuli of the outside world\nso that the internal impulses of\nour dancing can be felt, seen and\nacted upon. Once the outer\narrangement has less of an influ-\nence, then the inner space be-\ncomes fuller, more alive and its\nrange of possibilities become\nwider. The awareness of change\nin the inner space becomes vivid\nso that when the outer space of\nour world increases its influence,\nwe do not lose the ground we\nhave gained from the inner world.\nThese statements were gleaned\nfrom a month's worth of writings,\nthoughts and discussions I participated\nin at Naropa Institute Summer 1986.\nHowever vague and general, they seem\nto apply to the state of mind we reach\nwhen awareness is brought to our\ndancing. During the course of the four\nweeks of Contact Improvisation classes\ntaught by Nancy Stark Smith, we talk-\ned a lot about the \"Ready State,\"\nnever actually defining it, but neverthe-\nless knowing when it had occurred.\nThere never seemed to be a standard\nway of preparing the body to dance,\nbut one ingredient was always required.\nAwareness of body sensation, move-\nment and body/mind states. Once in\nthe \"Ready State,\" every part of our\nbeing participates actively. When not\nready, some part of us hangs back,\nwatches, refusing to participate, creat-\ning a rift within our own dancing and\nbetween us and our partner.\nIt seems that awareness implies\naction, and if this is true, then in the\n\"Ready State\" of Contact Improvisa-\ntion we must actively know our sensa-\ntions, movement and mind states. To\nknow actively, or to bring awareness to\ndancing allows expression; the exchange\nof one body of knowledge with anoth·\ner. In my ignorance, I seemed to think\nthat the \"Ready State\" was something\nto be achieved. A way of doing this\nwas to identify the stages one might go\nthrough to reach the \"Ready Stire.\"\nThey came as follows:\n1. Getting into the body-requires\na shifting of mind into bodily terms,\ni.e., sensation, imagery and movement\nquality.\n2. Body time-now in the body,\nthe action is of deepening quality.\n3. Body Sensitivity---,body sensation\nand states of mind become finely\ntuned. The sensitivity to and aware-\nness of body sensation and body minds\nis increased.\n4. Body Expression and Exchange-\nmoving out of inner sensation and into\nexchange with a partner. The body be-\ncomes the mode from which I relate.\nAlthough these stages offered some\ninsight into the process, they also told\nme something about my ambition to\nachieve something that I thought was\nnecessary. The \"Ready State\" requires\nonly to be where you are, not where\nyou think you should be. This slight\nshift means bringing an awareness to\nthe changes happening in our dancing;\nchanging and guiding the changes as\nwell, so that the dancing becomes an\nexchange between the inner and outer\nimpulses. This awareness is full bod-\nied, the mind responds to the body\nand the body responds to the mind. It\nis a way of being with change. Being\ncomfortable with frustration, ambigu-\nity and basically not knowing what\ncomes next. A way of being which\nbegins without expectations of what\nwill come, freeing you to be with\nwhatever is occurring.\nIn looking back at the time spent\nat Naropa, I see that we seemed to\ncreate a space for ourselves that aimed\nfor freedom from distraction. We\ncleared and prepared ourselves to\ndance in the most honest way we knew\nhow. The discipline of Contact Im-\nprovisation requires this clarity of\nbody, mind and spirit, so that the\nperson can deepen within the form\nand of equal importance, enjoy their\ndancing.{::{",

The material that I\npresented was what I call the puppet-puppeteer motif. I developed this style\nof movement out of an image from a Robin Feld class working with manipu-\nlations. She was dressed in black and was moving a colorfully dressed person.\nI asked people to start off with a light touch, suggesting working the pup-\npet by the upper body from behind, using the puppet's upper arms, or by\npulling and leading from in front. The puppeteer does all the initiation; the\npuppet can follow through but not initiate. For example, the puppeteer can\nmove the puppet's arm up and the puppet's arm can then slowly float down\nlike a feather. Then the quality can get heavier, the puppeteer can bring the\npuppet into his or her center, taking more weight, nurturing and caring for\nthe puppet; finally bringing the puppet to the floor, rocking it and putting it\nto sleep. I used this motif in a section of a dance that I created and performed\nin New York, June 1985, called \"The River of Cause (because because because\nbecause because).\"",

    "Text": "The jam/conference was a dialogue\nbetween doing and contemplation,\nplaying freely and then defining what\nseemed to be happening. It was a spa-\ncious time where together we sculpted\nour shifting understandings of the\nwork.\nOne of the joys of this process of in-\nquiry was its immediacy-the being\nable to move from a stimulating discus-\nsion straight into dancing-or coming\nupon a discovery dancing ... and\nhaving the context, right there, to im-\nmediately share it with someone, or\nthe group ... so to articulate the\nelusive find .. .\nIn this setting the work was given\nrange, depth, and focus-we experi-\nenced it as a vehicle of personal expres-\nsion and development and as an influ-\nence in the structure of today's society.\nAnd the conference was about\nCOMMUNITY.\nOther than finding out about the broad\nand concentrated research that is hap-\npening, I recall the connectedness and\npower I experienced'there. I've been\nin many group situations and worked\non many projects, but I've never felt\nsuch a strong, nurturing, and inspiring\nsense of community.\nThere were no leaders or followers-\nrather we were all leaders and follow-\ners, speakers and listeners, guides 'and\njourneyers. There were plenty of op-\nportunities for both taking in new in-\nformation, ideas and processes-and\npresenting ideas or formats or situa-\ntions. It happened in structured ways-\nsuch as the classes where four different\npeople would take a segment and pre-\nsent an approach to teaching-and it\nhappened in informal meetings, dia-\nlogues, and dances.\nThis in itself was a melding of idea and\npractice. One evening Steve Paxton got\ninto a 'where-does-contact-improvisa-\ntion-fit-in to-the-history-of-dance' talk,\nand described that one of the roots of\ncontact was its aim to break with the\nconventional representations of social\nstructure; to deal with relationships\nbetween people on a more anarchistic/\ndemocratic level.\nAnd true to its form, this open struc-\nture allowed a lot of energy to be ex-\nchanged. Not only did we discover our\nsimilarities, but also our differences.\nThere were questions of style & process\n& orientation that were not always\neasy for people to negotiate-yet a will-\ningness to encompass it all and work it\nthrough pervaded. And again, the flu-\nency .between these states was really\nexcmng, and I find, now gives me a\nnew perspective when working with\npeers. Something about keeping the\nspace open enough to allow for the\nfree flow of input from all.\nAnd we looked at the question of\nPERFORMANCE ... is performance a\nrelevant part of contact improvisation?\n. .. is it appropriate to put the work\nout for audiences to see? One answer\nwas Steve Paxton's comment, \"Yes.\nFor me, performing is the reward you\nget for being allowed to handle the\nidea.\"\nPerformance is putting the work into a\ndomain where other people can respond\nto it, where the ideas & forms will be\nexamined and thereby shaped.\nIn the performance setting, the audi-\nence is bringing a mindset-this helps\nbring the evocative power of allegory\nand metaphor to the activity of the\ndance.\nAnd one of the values of performance\nin improvisation to me is simply the\nlooking for ways to shape the work-\n( or have the Work shape itself) into a\nself-complete form, being able to tran-\nscend the realm of research and move\ninto the realm of .... at least some-\nthing which is enjoyable for people to\nwatch, participate in through watching\nand reacting, through the natural use\nof metaphor-putting their life into\naction-out there, and providing for\nthe audience, just through the sheer\npleasure of the movement, the oppor-\ntunity for them to relate to ....\nWEIGHT\nrising and falling\nfloating\ndiving\nup\nrushing\nbouncing\nhang-gliding\njagged free jazzing\nSo in the dancing (as well as in consid-\nering the direction the work as a whole\nis t~king) it's all about \"being able to\nbe m the spaces of uncertainty & am-\nbiguity with confidence ... \"\nWe were considering the question,\n\"What is contact improvisation?,\" and\nNancy's comment was, \"a group like\nthis preserves the recipe.\"\nThe work is, and will become, what\nwe bring to it.\nTHIS COMMUNITY IS EXPLORING\nITSELF. i:",

    "Text": "This piece was written in 1979. We\ndiscovered it in our files and found the\nissues in it still very much alive. We\ntalked with Paul about it and be agreed.\nHe also noted that shortly after this\nperiod, performances of improvisation\nin New York City seemed to disappear\nfor several years. [Eds.]\n\nI suspect there are many\npeople presently involved in moving\nart forms who, except for exposure to\ncontact improvisation, would not have\nentered the field. My experience is a\ncase in point. As an art major in col-\nlege, I enjoyed creating large sculptural\nenvironments for the body. The\nweight and awkwardness of the mater-\nials, plywood, two-by-fours, and other\nconstruction hardware, turned building\na piece into a physical work-out.\nSculpting was an arranging dance,\nusing the whole body.\n\nDuring this time (1973), Curt Sid-\ndall, Nita Little, Steve Paxton, Nancy\nStark Smith, and someone whom I re-\nmember well except for her name\n[Karen Radler] came to perform and\nteach contact on the west coast for\nthe first time. I danced some and\nwatched a lot. The idea of people\npresenting natural movement as a\nperformance was a pleasant jolt to me.\nThe democratic give and take between\npartners was appealing. Improvising\ndance, creating while performing was,\nfor me, a revelation. And my person-\nality was more comfortable with the\nsocial circumstances of dancing than\nthe solitude of sculpture.\n\nMy first dancing was suffused with\ncomparisons between sculpture and\ncontact. It was as if the four-by-eight\nplywood sheets I had been building\nwith developed power steering, and\ncould even lift me off the ground.\n\nThe three-dimensional experience of\nsculpture became four-dimensional,\nthe fourth dimension being the time\nof the dance. I was no longer the\nmanipulator. For every impulse of\nmine, there was another independent\n\nnervous system deciding what was hap-\npening as well. I saw that contact is\nvery purely about process. In terms\nof sculpture, that meant showing how\nfascinating it is to make a piece, rather\nthan showing a finished piece.\n\nThrough performing, I like letting\nothers in on the creating side of the\nwork, the side most interesting to me.\nSince that time, I've performed in\nmany different situations; contact,\nother improvised structures, and set\npieces. In watching dance or perform-\ning it, I'm drawn to dancing which\ndoesn't impose a style on the people\nwho dance. This may partly be a\nhangover from art training which en-\ncourages students to find an individual\nvision from the start of training. I'm\nglad this idea has a lot of credence in\nthe dance world now.\n\nImprovisation is one way of work-\ning individualistically either in a group\nor solo. A problem is that improvisa-\ntion and performance are sometimes\nfriends. We all know of our on nights\nand our off nights. Those who perform\nimprovisation have decided that the\npluses outweigh the minuses. The\npluses are that the dancers are present-\ning a raw slice of life, uncut, uncooked.\nThe audience's position is elevated be-\ncause they are allowed to get in on the\nwhole story as it happens for the first\ntime. They aren't watching something\nwhich has been edited in rehearsal.\n\nImprovisation is risky and often re-\nwarding for the performers. It is a way\nfor performers to move on with work,\nnot to stick with an image or sequence\nwhich must be repeated several times.\nThe formal qualities of contact make\nit a focused and grounded improvisa-\ntional technique. There is a basic\nagreement between performers which\nprovides a continual springboard into\nthe dance. A performer of contact has\na lot of freedom.\n\nI'm sitting here writing about how\ngood a performance improvisation\nmakes, and resisting tooth and nail the\ndetractions. However, there are some.\nThere is no overall structure to control\nthe impact of the performance. It's\nlike having several small dances linked\ntogether. Dull repetition can be a\nproblem. When this happens, it's like\nwatching the same rehearsed dance\nseveral times in one piece. This is one\nof the main limitations in previous\ndance work which many of us are try-\ning to avoid by investigating improvi-\nsation. An ideal piece has few seams\nshowing. There are a lot of ways to\napproach this, but they mostly have to\ndo with pre-planning. It's difficult to\nachieve in an improvised performance.\nThere also are some beautiful possibili-\nties in pre-setting a piece; it can have\nlong sections of synchronized move-\nment, it can be a story, it can have\nspecial timing, or it can deal with the\npersonae and not the personality of\nthe performer. The search for these\nqualities is improvised but their presen-\ntation is, for the most part, set.\n\nSafety is important in contact.\nThis results in contact being playful,\ngame-like, and positive. There is a\nutopian communal quality to contact-\na great experience but not the whole\npicture. This one-keyed quality can be\nlimiting for an audience, and make\nperforming frustrating. There is little\nroom to explore subjects like discord,\ntragedy, or events which are fantastic\nor grotesque. Sometimes I want to\nentertain/be entertained with these\nrich images. Sometimes I want the\npurity and abstraction of contact.\n\nWhen I perform contact, I like to\nfeel that we, the performers, are shar-\ning the performance with the audience.\nAmong the most satisfying perform-\nances in this respect was a series done\nat the Paula Cooper Gallery in New\nYork City [1978). We performed in\nthe afternoon for three days, three\nhours per day. The audience was free\nto come and go. Those who stayed\nwanted to be there. As the perform-\nance progressed, the size and closeness\nof the audience increased. Neither the\naudience nor the piece was set. There\nwas a cumulative effect from perform-\ning for a long time for three days in a\nrow. Our dancing became very sure,\nand many audience members returned\ntwo or three times to watch. By the\nend of the third day we all felt like\ngood friends. We felt like the home\nteam.\n\nIn the last year, I've been doing\ncontact wearing different costumes.\nThe costumes put a context into the\ndancing. Nina Martin and I did cos-\ntumed contact as part of a living sculp-\nture exhibit at the Susan Caldwell\nGallery. Every half-hour or so, we\nchanged clothes. We danced in paja-\nmas, swimming suits, winter clothes,\nformal attire, and disco polyester. The\ncostumes interest me because they\nprovide a lasting image, however weird,\nof what the dancing is about. A sub-\nliminal story unfolded with each\nchange. (Paul and Nina went to the\nprom all dressed up. They felt good\nand started rolling on top of each\nother. Nina's hat got squashed, so she\nthrew it away while climbing on Paul's\nback. They both fell into the buffet\ntable, pensively. When the music\nstarted, Paul rolled up Nina's body and\nshe supported him upside down with\nhis jacket wrapped around his head.)\nSomeone else may be having other\ndaydreams as they watch. Our only\nplan was to do contact after putting\non the different clothes, not to inject\nthe movement itself with any plot or\nmeaning. The dancing did feel very\ndifferent each time we changed, mostly\nbecause the physical sensations of each\noutfit were so different. Winter\nclothes to swimming suits was a big\nchange. As at the Paula Cooper Gal-\nlery, the audience could come and go.\nWe felt very connected to the audience\nthat stayed with us. Long perform-\nances are satisfying. We had a long\ntime to allow the dancing to grow and\nchange. Where we got the stamina tq\ndo a three hour duet, I don't know.\n\nSolo space is something I want to\nsee and do more of. It's a way for in-\ndividual eccentricities to come out.\nVoice work, props, or other movement\nforms are possible without being filter-\ned through that great equalizer, the\ncontact duet.\n\nContact ideas have been used as\nparts of different dance performances\nvery successfully. Often I think of\ncontact as a technique, or resource,\nrather than the thing to be performed.\nHere are just a few of the ways I liked\ncontact being incorporated. In Simone\nForti's Planet,.Terry O'Reilly and\nDavid Taylor did a low, slow, slither-\ning contact duet with intermittent\npauses based on reptilian movement\nwhile other animal-inspired dancing\nwas happening at the same time. In\nMeredith Monk/Ping Chong's Chacon,\nEli Pollock did a contact solo as the\nbasis for his role as a drunken or crazy\nvillager. Mary Overlie's The Figure has\na section of \"spatial contact\"; dancing\nmostly without touching, but reacting\nto external sensing, and developing a\nflow with a partner(s). Last year, at\nthe Contact Quarterly benefit in New\nYork City, about twenty different\ncontact pieces were shown. The varie-\nty was tremendous. There was a lot\nof experimenting and potential.\n\nContact is democratic. Performers\nhave equal opportunities in perform-\nance which, for me, is one of its great\nattractions. This equality shows in\nperformance. The round robin form,\nand the freedom to start and stop\ndancing when you want is politically\nhealthy for us humans. All contactors\nhave a decision-making role as they\ndance, becoming their own directors.\n\nI have performed frequently in\ncompanies with directors, especially\nwith Meredith Monk. What the direc-\ntor/company situation offers is greater\nspecificity and depth of vision. The\nwork process in The House (Meredith's\ncompany) is interesting. She frequent-\nly sketches out what to work on. We\nimprovise and then set the most suit-\nable material during rehearsal. Then\nwork is further edited, or expanded\nand arranged with the other material\nin the piece. There are often sections\nof structured improvisation. In creat-\ning and performing, each performer\nhas some responsibility as author,\ndirector, and actor.\n\nMy thoughts on performance are\nopen ended. Performing contact is\nrewarding, and there is an audience\nfor it. It's reminiscent of a sports\nevent minus the competition; the\nfocus is on the moment to moment\ninterplay of individuals rather than the\noutcome. A set piece offers other pos-\nsibilities, both as performer and viewer.\nThe two don't exclude each other. I\nhope the' multiplicity of performing\npossibilities continues to thrive and\ncross-fertilize. 1::",

    "Text": "The first CALIFORNIA HARBIN HOT SPRINGS CONTACT JAM was real good.\nI hod a nice time. A lot of people come from where /live-the Bay Area-but some from\nChico, one from Boulder and a few from other West Coast towns.\nBeing a newcomer to the contact community, I felt unfamiliar with what a jam\nwas supposed to be. You know, I hod read some earlier issues of CQ, taken a couple\nclasses from N. S. Smith at Wesleyan U., even did some Cl in NYC at PS122. But, going\naway for a long weekend with complete strangers to bathe in hot pools and dance didn't\nexactly make me feel at home, or at ease.\nWhat was the purpose of a jam, besides a reunion for those who hod already been\npracticing the form for awhile? I could tell there were some of us who were new to this\nkind of situation and didn't know precisely what was going on. This initial awkward\ntime reminded me of my first high school dance.\nAbout everyone agreed that music and dance should be present (but separate\nsome of the time) during the weekend. A lot of us, including myself, were interested in\nnot setting particular times for dancing and drumming or even bedtime. Someone re-\nmarked that the time might be felt organically.\nAt first, not a lot of time was spent collectively breathing or arriving. \"Plunging\nin\" is what seemed to be the desire of many. Maybe the hot springs pools provided the\nspringboard for this desire. I couldn't join the flow, though, because plunging in is a\nfear of mine. I needed to toke time to sit and think and tune into myself for what I\nwanted from this jam.\nWe were in a completely new world at Harbin, a rustic 7000 mile woodland,\nmountainous tree-lined areas volleying and rising oil around our enclosed dance shelter.\nA small brook ran by with clear water from the Napa Valley (wine country here in\nCalifornia). But with oil that beautiful natural environs, it was still troubling to me not\nknowing the jam boundaries. What were the rules of the game, as they soy? I sow possi-\nbilities in group sex, a homosexual and heterosexual couples' scene, raucous contact,\nsoft-eye dancing, rolling and breathing.\nAll this stuff I felt Friday night or so. Then, on Saturday morning, things opened\nup. Some of the senior members of the group taught half-hour mini-courses in Contoct-\nesque basics and new discoveries. I went up to the pools in the afternoon. It wosn 't so\nbod there. It was softer and quieter than in the dance shelter. Hazy and lazy, strong\nand light, mole and female, folks were just chatting and healing. Four of us novice con·\ntocters huddled our arms together in the pool and floated around like a spinning wheel.\nWe talked about what we sow Friday night. To my surprise, we shored a lot of common\nobservations. Then, we steamed in the hottest tub. We walked out ofter\\·ords, my\nbones felt heavy and my muscles suspended around my bones.\nOn Saturday night, .the jam got together in a circle to discuss the moi•ement of\nthe weekend. While people talked, someone tossed small coloriul ploybolls bock and\nforth in the circle. It looked like a game of marbles. You would toss a boll into the\ncenter and someone would try to knock yours out of the center and onto the periphery.\nThen, I forget who rolled herself into the center as a human marble. People giggled and\nrolled her around. Others joined her. That beautiful stock of 64 pillows by the \\·all\nbecome the next marbles, and a huge and monstrous pillow fight ensued. Finale: a dive\nbombing affair.\nPillow rumble, it was real good. A lot of heavy stuff. Straight, bold and big\nstrides over obstacles into the pile of tossed pillows. The rest of the weekend was fun.\nI think we, as a group of disparate individuals, discoi·ered our challenge: a common\nground. I think we also discovered a commitment: on organic message. To me, it was\non unfurling of the foll, a movement outward and down across the floor. As I spoke\nwith someone on Sunday afternoon on the trail bock from our lost dip in the pool, I\nfelt a return.",

    "Text": "November 18-21 , 1986\nTheaters.chool, Modern Dance Department\nAmsterdam, Holland\nParticipants: Meret Schlegel, Christine Goigg, Doniel Trenner, Lindo Forsman, Jacqueline\nde Vries, Wolfgang Grof, Mork Tompkins, Howard Sonenklor, Moniek van der Look,\nDoniel Lepkoff, Andrew Horwood, Pierre Riou, Bob Rease, Pauline de Groot, Pierre\nSerophin, Suzanne .Cotto, jean Bloch-Laroque, Stephen Crowford, Lucio Walker, Koren\nNelson, Alita Alessi, Bruno Stefononi, Elinor Rodeff, Margot Rijven, Nancy Stork Smith,\nKirstie Simson, Renate Muller, Wolter Weiler, Cathie Caraker, Gonne Kooy1 Nien Mari Chotz\nThe first meeting on Tuesday evening\nwas impressive. After introducing ourselves\nand talking about the schedule (prepared by\nElinor, Renate and Cathie, who had organ·\nized the conference), we came together for\ndancing. I was happy in the very plain\nmeaning of the word. Happy, because I\ncould dance with people without demon-\nstrating anything in terms of teaching, with-\nout thinking about the next step in leading\na class. There is this underlying structure\nI am dreaming of, there is this language\nspoken so well, that you can make poems.\nThe room was filled with the atmosphere of\nlight and easy dancing.\nWe began the next morning with a warm·\nup led by Nancy, focusing on the questions:\nWhat do I need to get ready to dance with\nanother person? How do I know what? Do\nI teach the other what I need? (The motiva-\ntion for dancing: just a topic for teachers in\ntheir daily life.) The day got heavier, guided\nby a dense schedule we were not really able\nto fulfill. On the evening before, there had\nbeen at least ten people interested in teach-\ning at this conference; now there was nobody.\nSo, instead of co-teaching (which was set on\nthe schedule), we gave brief personal reports\nof our work, one by one in the circle. Many\nissues were presented, but at that time we\nwere not ready to pick them up for further\ndiscussions. (For example: falling as a need\nfor giving up the image of yourself; realness\nof Contact; the help of aikido, tai-chi, medi-\ntation and body-work; to look what is\nbeyond the form; relationship between\nground and space.)\nThe afternoon was spent with CO-\nTE ACHING: three people share the time\n(two hours) with or without connetting\ntheir material. It does not mean to find\nsomething new, but to give the chance to\nlook at how other teachers teach. This time,\nBruno worked with sounds leading to Con-\ntact. Pierre treated the left side of our bodies\nincluding our vision and ended up (surpris-\ningly) with cart-wheels. Moniek then went\nfrom personal movement into group-improv-\nisation, followed by open dance. People\nwere kind of uneasy or ungrounded. Later\nwe tried to find out why. Someone observed\nthat we were \"bad\" students. We felt that\nwe were confused by Pierre's sudden change\nof direction and by the different teachings.\nMoniek got nervous when she realized that\nher intentions did not work out. A small\n\"accident\" happened, but nobody was hurt,\nand the open dance was exciting to watch.\n{There was no \"feedback\" scheduled but\nwe found time for it in the very last discus-\nsion on Friday, and got to some interesting\npoints .... One was the issue of how to deal\nwith accidents in class: to pay attention to\nthe hurt person, according to the situation;.\nto pay attention to the partner as well, be-\ncause he might feel guilty; a teacher can\nget feedback for their teaching by remem-\nbering the energy in the room when an\naccident happened.)\nWe left for dinner on the first day with-\nout a clear plan for the evening activity-\nsomehow confused and very tired. Many\npeople thought it was because of the talking\n(which was actually listening), or, because\nof the dense structure, or what? Some peo·\npie began to already participate only part-\ntime. Other people found this attitude dis-\nturbing. This evening almost nobody came.\nThe second day began with co-teaching.\nKaren and Alito led the warm-up: first\ntaking turns watching your partner's breath\n(who is lying on the floor), then doing a\nwarm-up dance together and talking about\nit afterwards. Danny Trenner then led us\nthrough exercises where we sang contra-\npuntal jazz rhythms in two groups while\ndoing contact, to learn to work with an\nexternal rhythm while improvising, without\nbeing disturbed by it.\nAfter tea-break, we started our first dis·\ncussion: the essence of teaching; different\ncultures; contact in performance; problems\nof teaching. The suggestion of splitting into\nsmaller groups was made but not accepted:\nthere was either no need to split at that\nmoment, or, more likely, there was the fear\nof missing something being discussed else·\nwhere. We got into a constructive discus-\nsion about TEACHERS' AND STUDENTS'\nROLES. Unlike the martial arts, where the\nmaster-role is very clear, the teacher-role in\nContact Improvisation can be confusing.\nBut, as a teacher, instead of being over-\nwhelmed by a student's fantasies and pro-\njections, you can receive their energy and\ngive it back. Also, if you don't take a stu-\ndent's aggression or resistance too personal-\nly, you can break the psychological cycle.\nOn the other hand, you do have to find a\nway to work with difficult students. You\ncannot avoid conflicts. The whole psycho-\nlogical situation in a class can be like Con-\ntact Improvisation itself: give and receive\nweight and transform energy.\nThe after-lunch co-teaching was done by\nStephen, Mark, and Kirstie. In the begin·\nning, Stephen worked with being absolutely\ndead and then responding to your partner's\nleading. Mark talked about one's habits {Do\nthey work with this partner?) and how de-\ncisions are made in the dance. Kirstie had\nus centered and did some Ki-testing. At the\nend, they experimented with teaching their\nmaterial simultaneously to the whole group,\nleaving us in a chaos.\nThis evening, after having dinner together\nat the school, we went into the NETWORK-\nING DISCUSSION, an important part of the\nconference. The discussion was dominated\nby finding a place and an organizer for the\nnext conference. Will there be a next one?\nHow do we prepare it? It was a hot discus-\nsion, at least for those who participated\nverbally. For many of us, the English was\ntoo fast and the statements were not related\nenough to each other. Some were interested\nin just a jam and others were not interested\nin open dancing at all. But to find out what\nwas most important in a teachers conference\nfor the whole group was just impossible.\nSome quarreling gathered around the\nquestion of how structured a conference\nshould be in terms of prepared topics, etc.\nLooking back, I think that we somehow felt\nthat the \"teaching exchange\" focus of this\nyear's confe\"rence didn't really work, the\nco-teaching was not convenient to every-\nbody, there was not enough open dancing,\nand not enough time to meet people person-\nally, all at the same time. And the confer-\nence will be over within the next day! But\nwe could see clearly that a group-process is\na group-process and cannot be compressed\ninto one evening of talking about the sched-\nule, but has to take place.\nBy a vote we defined: all want another\nconference, three-quarters want more un·\nscheduled time. We agreed on two days of\njam to get to know each other and to arrive,\nand three days of conference. We define\nourselves as a support-group, but we can deal\nwith a technical conference too. Also, the\nspirit of a conference is dependent on the\norganizer.\nAnother conflict arose because of Euro·\npeans and Americans discussing European\nnetworking. One difficulty of this mix {in\nother aspects quite constructive) is the dif·\nferent ways of communicating: the strong\noutput of American participants vs. the\nEuropean's preference for listening. More-\nover, we Europeans have to stay in our cities\nto keep something going on, (and are not\ntravelling around Europe giving workshops\nas much). We are still relying on each other;\nwe have to. This is why the next day we\nmade a gathering of European teachers\n(people who are settled in Europe and teach\nhere) to talk about practical network.\nIn that meeting, we agreed that it had\nbeen necessary for the first two conferences\nto invite somebody (i.e. Nancy) who is very\nwell known and experienced. Her most\nvaluable function has not been so much her\nattraction to get people to the conference,\nbut her catalyzing presence. Yet, we will try\nto make it without special invitations next\ntime and try to share the responsibility\nequally among everyone. On the practical\nlevel, we decided to meet next year not in a\ncity but in a house in the countryside, which\nmeans meeting in the summertime. Three\npeople volunteered to take responsibility, to\nensure a gathering would happen. [See\n'Notices' in this Newsletter for details about\nnext conference.] The networking was\nunderstood as a real supportive one, not only\nin terms of teaching, but also as an exchange\nof performances and projects, ideas. This is\nthe formal structure, the rest of it has to be\ndeveloped in personal relationships.\nThe European communication is still\narranged through the NEWSLETTER, co-\nordinated each time by a different person.\nWe ended the conference with a final\nround robin and a party. We felt we have\nawakened potential connections all over\nEurope, seen that teaching problems get\nless dramatic when discussing them, and\ninspired each other through our dance~.\nSee you next year.\nCi\n::l",

    "Text": "The first time I danced contact it was in a dream:\nfiltered light, heaviness in my lungs, another's weight and\nbreath rolling against my back, blood pulsing in my ears.\nSeven years later, my dream came true.\nCold and shivering in the murky water of a small lagoon I\ndive and turn, hearing my breath in my ears, diaphragm\nconstricted, straining to see a long grey form swimming\nlazpy below me. I come to the surface for air, my breath\nexploding in a burst. I breathe in deep and dive below\nagain. After a few minutes of swimming I feel my skin\nbeginning to warm. I stretch my limbs in the water, let-\nting the physical movement calm me. The energy moves\ndown out of my head and into my heart. I feel my heart-\nbeat regulate and my breath softening. My attention\nturns to the sounds around me, mostly clicking and tril-\nling. What I sense is that sound in the water has a great\ndeal of movement. The noises bounce and vibrate below\nthe surface. Suddenly I feel a nudge against the back of\nmy knees, and turning I look into the eyes of a large\nsmooth skinned dolphin. He opens his long mouth in a\nwide grin and the sound that comes from the blow hole on\nthe top of his head is surprisingly like a human laugh. In\nturn I laugh back, amazed, and find myself with a mouth-\nful of salty water. I surface again for air and quickly dive\nbelow again. Moving slowly towards him under the water\nI keep my arms at my sides to appear less threatening, and\nbrush against his smooth back with my chest and belly.\nThe dolphin gently grabs my arm in his.mouth. It is an\nodd sensation, having this huge mammal hold me between\nbis 88 teeth (same as a piano, but that's a different story).\nKnowing this is a sign of friendship I try and hold still un-\ntil he releases me. His mouth feels like the grasp of a small\nchild's fingers. Feeling like it is my turn to make a move I\nreach for the dorsal fin in the middle of his back and hold\non tight to catch my first dolphin ride. The dorsal fin\nfeels very firm. It is like a smooth, rubber covered, trian-\ngular shaped tree branch. It isn't slippery at all; on the\ncontrary, my hand feels like it is touching a wet piece of\nsolid rubber. We are side by side, under the surface, as the\ndolphin pulls me through the water. We both come up for\nair, dive again and then I notice on my other side a slightly\nsmaller dolphin. I reach over with my free hand and grab\nthe dorsal fin, arms extended, racing through the water I\nfeel like I'm flying. Feeling the water's friction pulling\nagainst my skin I imitate the undulating motion of the\ndolphins. This second dolphin is a female, and she is hap-\npy to join us. We twist, dive, nudge and explore the\nsimilarities and differences ·in the way we move.\nWhen I first danced contact I dreamed about it often. At\nfirst I thought it was because I was learning something new\nand it was occupying my thoughts in my waking hours.\nAs I remembered more of my dreams I realized dreaming\ncontact was a way for me to dance contact without the\nusual limitations of a wakeful dance. I could move and\ndance in complete 3-dimensional space. In my contact\ndreams I had no horizon to limit or guide me.\nI feel this freedom in the water with these two lovely,\ngraceful creatures. I am aware of a dream-like quality to\nour water dancing. We spin and chase, touqb and push,\narching and tumbling, ignoring for once gravity and its\nconstant demand. I feel an exhilarating freedom in this\noriginal and most basic liquid. They are home in it. I am\njust a visitor, very aware of my smaller lungs and lack of\nendurance, yet they welcome me and honor my limita-\ntions. I fill my lungs again and dive, following their\nshadowy forms swimming ahead of me. They turn and\nwait, and as I catch up they separate slightly so that I am\nin the middle between them. We all come up for air, and\nthey stay, bobbing in the water next to me. My husband\nand daughter ca11 a greeting to me from the shore and I\nstart to swim towards them. The male dolphin quickly\nmoves in front of me, blocking my way, while his female\nfriend nudges me back into deeper water. I am mostly\nsurprised, a little frightened to find myself in a dolphin\nsandwich without a lot of movement possibilities. How\ndo I convey Time-Out? Breathing deep I center my\nweight and push outwards with my arms as I duck below\nthe surface and head out into the direction they were\npushing me. They surface next to me, one in front and\nthe other behind me. I tread water and laugh outloud.\nI'm incredulous and pleased that they want to keep me in\nthe water. I feel like a dolphin play-thing. I reach out\nwith my arms, twisting myself slightly, and grab bold of\ntheir dorsal fins. We all take a breath and we're off again,\na dolphin on either side of me. We make a large circle of\nthe lagoon and then they start towards shore. We are\ndiving and surfacing, diving and surfacing, sunlight shining\non the water, the salty breeze, my daughter laughing and\nclapping her little bands. Diving and surfacing, two\ndolphins and a woman making brief contact, making a\ndream-like dance. -ti\nrubber-stamp by Gottlieb-Clark",

    "Title": "The Politics of Improvisation",
    "Authors": [
      "Carol Horwitz"
    ],
    "Text": "Of all the dance forms,\nimprovisation is probably the most\npolitical-because it contains the\nurgency of immediacy. Improvisation\nforces people to make decisions on\ntheir feet and to live with those deci-\nsions. It helps people to see how their\ndecisions affect others. When done\nby groups of people, it has everything\nto do with learning to work with\nothers-not competing but working\nwith the idea of the total picture and\nthe individual's small but significant\nplace in that overall picture. When\nworking in duet form, as in contact\nimprovisation, one is forced to really\nlisten to what the other body is say-\ning. In contact, movement choices\nare based upon forces of nature such\nas gravity and the spiral plus a direct\nresponse to the movement of the\npartner's body. This ability means\nsurvival in the contact form. While\nimprovising, we learn again and again\nthat to listen to another's movement\nis to come to a shared meeting ground.\nThis is the politics of improvisation.\nWith this in mind, I conducted an\ninformal survey in the fall of 1984 to\nsee how improvisation was being used\nin colleges and universities through-\nout the United States. Because of\nfinancial constraints, I wrote only to\ndance programs which offered at least\na masters degree in dance. There were\n60 in all; 31 responded. Here follows\nthe information gathered:\n25 of the 31 schools who respond-\ned had improvisation courses. 5\nschools offered it only as part of\nanother course such as composition.\n15 schools offered one level, 7 offered\nit at 2 levels, and 3 schools offered\nthree levels. 10 schools awarded 1\ncredit, 9 schools awarded 2 credits,\n4 awarded 3 credits and 2 awarded\n4 credits. 27 of the 31 schools be-\nlieved it should be a required course,\n16 believed one semester was enough,\n4 felt that 2 semesters sufficed, 2\nthought 3 should be required and one\nbelieved 4 semesters should be re-\nquired. 15 schools allowed it to be\nrepeated for credit.\nAccompaniment for class ranged\nfrom voice to sounds, to canned\nmusic, piano and percussion, the\nrange generally found in technique\nclasses. The music was primarily\nprovided by the instructor with occa-\nsional visits by musicians. One college\nalways had live accompaniment, but\nthis was the exception.\nIt was felt that a wide variety of\nmovement experiences should be of-\nfered in improvisation classes. These\nshould include experiences with an\naural, visual and art emphasis. Stu-\ndents should be exposed to the ele-\nments of dance in their most funda-\nmental forms: space, rhythm/time,\ndynamics, body articulation, effort\nqualities, line, emotional qualities,\ngesture, sound, texture, sensory aware-\nness on all levels. Other important\naspects to include were phrase devel-\nopment, chance [methods], environ-\nmental inspiration, examination of\npersonal idioms, group dynamics,\nelements of contact work, awareness\nof inner/outer space. Through these\nexperiences, students should show an\nimprovement in performance skills,\na greater ability to think on their feet,\ngreater trust in themselves and in each\nother, have an improved ability to re-\ncall, and generally be able to view the\ntotal picture within the framework of\nthe dance, and dance within the frame-\nwork of the arts.\nMost of the schools had members\nof their full-time faculty teach the\nimprovisation classes. The appropri-\nate teacher just seemed to surface.\nSome of the notable improvisation\nteachers mentioned were Daniel Nag-\nrin, Claudia Melrose, Kathryn Karipi-\ndes, Irini Nadel [Rockwell] , Barbara\nDilley, Shirley Ririe, Joan Woodbury,\nLoa Mangelson and Ann Riordan,\namong others. On only one occasion\ndid a Teaching Assistant teach improv-\nisation.\nQualifications for the \"ideal\" im-\nprovisation teacher would also qualify\na person for sainthood, things to\nwhich all dance teachers aspire. He or\nshe should be experienced, sensitive,\nhave an ability to work from a prob-\nlem-solving base, be able to create an\nenvironment safe for exploration, be\nconstructive, kind, open, have a sense\nof humor, empathy, extensive experi-\nence in improvisation performance,\nbe able to handle emotional blocks,\nhave an ability to work with imagery, be\nable to create a group dynamic, be\nable to structure problems that lead\nto meaningful solutions and, probably\nmost importantly, be able to change\nplans mid-stream.\nThe effects of improvisation ex-\nperience upon students were noticed\nin their ability to experiment, explore\nand develop bits of material. They\nhad a wider movement vocabulary,\nimproved creativity, were more in\ntouch with their own movement\nsources, took greater risks, created\nmore authentic, less stylistic work,\nhad improved technique and became\nmore sophisticated self-aware students.\nThey were more comfortable dancing\nwith others. Students often experi-\nenced an evolution from fear to de-\nlight and it was a turning point in\nmany of their lives.\nIt was felt that improvisation had\nvalue in and of itself. Besides the ob-\nvious benefit of helping students\nlearn to choreograph, it is an aid in\nlearning to see and understand dance\nmovement as it relates to all the arts.\nIt allows the uniqueness of the indi-\nvidual to be celebrated. It teaches\nstudents to consider the value of their\nown movements before setting judg-\nments. Improvisation enhances crea-\ntive thinking and problem-solving,\nheightens kinesthetic perception,\ncreates an awareness of group dynam-\nics, fosters a personal viewpoint about\ndance, deepens awareness of move-\nment logic and helps students to live\ncreatively.\nNo one mentioned the importance\nof improvisation in preparing students\nto teach children or members of the\n\"very special\" population. Also, the\nuse of improvisation in dance therapy\nwas not mentioned. I was surprised\nby this omission as I feel that improv-\nisation is the very basis for working\nwith these groups, which many danc-\ners will do at some point in their\ncareer.\nImprovisation is seen as an art form\nseparate from more \"conventional\"\ndance. At one school, students have\nto perform a structured improvisation\nbefore they can receive their dance\ndegree. It was felt that there are some\nwho are brilliant at improvising and\nthey should perform. There were\nmixed feelings about the way it should\nbe presented. Many saw it as having\nan important place within convention-\nal choreography or within structured\nchoreographic works. Some felt that\nit shouldn't be mixed with traditional\nchoreography. Some felt that it stood\nmore strongly in an intimate setting.\nThe University of Utah was one\nplace that received recognition as a\nplace to learn about improvisation.\nNaropa Institute was another. Some\nof the other schools mentioned were\nOhio State University, UCLA, Arizona\nState University, University of Texas\nat Austin, Wesleyan University, Univ-\nersity of Arizona at Tempe, Sarah\nLawrence, NYU School of the Arts,\nand Southern Methodist University.\nI think it is obvious from this\nsurvey that improvisation plays an\nimportant role in the training of\ndancers. I know there is a place in\ndance for the highly competitive class-\nes that train the super-tech dancers\nwho are so popular today, but I feel\nthis survey supports the belief that\nthere is still more to being a dancer,\nand that it can be uncovered through ·\nself-exploration. An improvisation\nclass can become the laboratory for\nexploration of the form and of the\nself. It can be a forum for sharing, not\ncompeting. It can be a place to cele-\nbrate our differences while helping us\nto understand that we share the same\nroots. \"Self-exploration,\" \"nurtur-\ning,\" \"sharing,\" \"celebrating,\" \"life-\nenhancing\"-to me, these words rep-\nresent a very strong, positive politics.\nIt's this approach that keeps dance\nvital and strong.~",

    "Text": "“Why is the aerial lift a signature of an accomplished Con-\ntact dancer?” [Lepkoff]\nA. It does take some physical skill and listening ability to com-\nmunicate timing, impulse and subtlety of moving weight and\nsupport in order to accomplish the aerial lift. I'd say it's more\nlike the ink than the signature. [Nelson]\n“Why are complete beginners so beautiful to watch, and ex-\nperienced Contact Improvisors often so boring?”·\nBeginners' Luck-we are watching an exploration of totally\nnew territory, the unknown. With experienced contact im-\nprovisors we see expanding knowledge of an infinite unknown.\nYet often a stage of doing contact involves a kind of automatic\nresponse, everything seems predictable for the viewer and doer,\neven if it still feels great to do, it can be personally stagnating.\nLearning new senses of disorientation and new choices of im-\nprovisation is challenging to the imagination.\n“Why is there a hierarchy of Contact skills?”\nSafety; some semblance of order is useful. To engage the\nsenses, gross and subtle, is an overwhelming field of discovery.\nA teacher's personal “hierarchy” of skills is probably\nsomething very alose to their own dancing of contact.\nP.S. What are yours?\n“Why are so many of my advanced Contact students un-\nconsciously resistant to learning?\n“Why can someone become advanced in a form based on com-\nmunication?”\nHow do you as a teacher read a person's unconscious? Is this\nan advanced form of communication?\n“Why do I expect to get 'danced on 1 at Contact jams?”\nPersonal history.\n“Why are Contact-based performances so devoid of vision\nand self-examination?”\nBecause it is an unprecedented performance form and a study\nof performance values doesn't come along with basic learn-\ning of and therefore showing of the work. It's a style of its\nown, still evolving.\n“Why does the allure of gymnastics skills overshadow the ex-\nploration of making contact?”\nCould be because everyone loves and marvels at the ability\nof gymnasts-like when you watch the Olympics-and it's ex-\nciting to see these tricks performed live. Maybe it stimulates\nchildhood memories.\n“Why do experienced Contact dancers get frustrated with\nbeginners?”\nBecause beginners are better at not knowing what could come\nnext.\n“Why does a form rooted in the senses give rise to a generic\nlook, when life itself is so varied?”\nWhy do human beings look alike, distinguishable from\nkangaroos?\n“Why did I overhear an audience member say during a C.I.\nperformance, 'How can adults do all of that and not seem\nto feel anything?'”\nHow can we make this incredibly rich and varied inner world\nof sensation visible to outside eyes? *",

    "Title": "The Berlin Jam I & II",

    "Text": "Living in Berlin for the last seven\nmonths I have had ample time to\nponder. As a foreigner I am often fac-\ned with a certain level of culture gap,\nand when this carried over into Contact\nImprov I found some issues which I\nwould like to share and invite comment\non. Can Contact Improv cross these\ngaps? Does Contact lmprov fit into the\nGerman society? And, more pertinent\nfor me, into the Berlin Society?\nContact Improv is not absent in\nBerlin, nor has it been for the last eight\nyears. Every week at least five different\nclasses are taught drawing more than 40\nstudents. Workshops are sponsored\nthroughout the year with fair success,\nand there are even a few performances,\nperformance groups here which have\nutilized Contact Improv. Clearly Con-\ntact Improv has precedent here. And yet\nno jam has been established. Why not?\nPreviously I lived in Seattle where a\njam has developed, especially over the\nlast three years, from a small group in-\nto a large society, unhierarchical, and\nvery supportive. The jam there draws\nfrom a community of about 100 people,\nand hosting between 15 and 30 people\neach Saturday. In the last year the Jam\nsponsored six or seven informal perfor-\nmances, and as a group we consumed\na lot of beer and time. The jam is a place\nto see people that I might not during the\nweek, and a place where I can get\ntogether with others and make ar-\nrangements for the following week. It\nhas been a place for learning contact in\na way which the classroom cannot pro-\nvide, and for helping other people to\nunderstand something which they can\nnot figure out by themselves. It is a\nplace where I can see some of the best\ndance in Seattle, and get to dance with\nsome of the best dancers. And all of this\nexists with a m1mmum of\ngovernment/bureaucracy.\nSo why has there been no initial in-\nterest in a jam in Berlin? Is it that in\nBerlin there is no interest in this sort of\ninteraction? Is it that my level of interest\ncomes across as pathological? Or do\npeople here only participate in contact\nclasses and workshops for the physical\ntraining? Yet the jam also provides ex-\nercise for those of us that like that sort\nof thing too. Is it the challenge of dan-\ncing without supervision? I have ex-\nperienced the desire to be critically\nobserved at times. Could it be that all\nof Berlin feels this way all of the time?\nNo. Actually for the last six months\nthere has been a jam in Berlin, and it\nhas had a significant participation.\nThose of us who do come have\ndeveloped into a society which I find\nreassuringly similar to the one I left in\nSeattle. And they have created some of\nthe most enjoyable dance I have ever ex-\nperienced. And with one exception not\none of them felt experienced enough in\nthe past to participate in a higher level\ncourse. In other words noone who has\nbeen involved in the preexisting contact\nsociety (note earlier exception) has par-\nticipated in the jam.\nThe jam has been publicized only by\nword of mouth, yet quite a few people\nhave found it with very little contact to\nthe established Contact Improv society.\nFurther, when I have talked to those\ndancers whom I know have danced\nContact Improv previously they are in-\nvariably aware of the jam and pertinent\ninformation regarding it, but they won't\nparticipate. First they want to know if\nthere will be music, and will someone\nbe leading, and how many people will\nbe there. There used to be music, but\nnow that the weather is warm I bicycle\nand can not carry the tape deck. I used\nto teach for 15 minutes or half an hour,\nbut now it cuts into our time to dance,\ntoo much. If you come there will be one\nmore person than I expected. Is this ar-\nrangement too risky for the experienc-\ned dancer?\nThe real question is \"what is 'being\ntaught?\" How is it possible that a large\ngroup of dancers can be involved in lear-\nning something and have no interest or\nincentive to use this knowledge? Can\nyou imagine studying German for eight\nyears and never trying to speak or read\nit except in the classroom? Let alone\nteach it without encouraging your\nstudents to practice somewhere? Just\nwhat was the experience of these ex-\nperienced Contact Improv dancers in\nBerlin? Does this kind of problem exist\nelsewhere? What is in the future for\nContact Improv? Is it possible that jams\nwill no longer be visited by experienced\ndancers? Is a Hierarchy developing? Is\nit possible, that in today's society tradi-\ntional values are becoming invalid, and\nthe sort of environment encountered in\na jam is no longer of interest? What\naspects of Contact lmprov have you\nseen change in the last few years? Could\nit be that Contact Improv is no longer\na vehicle for ideas, but merely a style of\nmovement?\nContact Improv has existed in Berlin\nfor nearly a decade. Now a society, in\nits infancy, has developed to support it.\nCommunication is opening up. The jam\nwelcomes all new participants (See let-\nter in this issue's CQ Newsletter).\nPerhaps in the future we will be able to\ninvite you here for an international Jam.\nIn the meantime, come and visit for\nyour next vacation. *\n\nTHE BERLIN JAM II.\nThe Berlin Jam has now been in\nexistence for over a year, and is\nshowing no signs of coming to an\nend. Many of the problems en-\ncountered a year ago have vanished,\nand the Jam is entering a new stage.\nAs it grows, new problems come to\nthe surface, and with time these also\nwill be replaced. At least three of the\nfour teachers offering contact\ncourses regularly here support the\nJam by informing their students of\nits existence. As a result, there is a\nregular attendance of 12-16 people,\nand usually one or two are there for\nthe first time. In return, information\nis exchanged in the Jam regarding\nthe classes and workshops which are\navailable. Furthermore, The Berlin\nContact Ballet has been formed by\nparticipants of the Jam, and has\nthree performance dates in the up-\ncoming months. On the other side,\nmany of the people who have taken\ncontact courses since before the Jam\nbegan have never been to the Jam. I\nhear that they do not have time since\nSaturday is the only day during the\nweek to take a day off from dance.\nThose of us who enjoy dancing on\nSaturday respect this, and appreciate\nit. I have also heard that some of\nthe more advanced dancers would\ncome if more of the other advanced\ndancers were there. Contact\nHierarchy?\nThe Berlin Jam is predominately\nmale, with a ratio of 2: 1. This is not\nsurprising in a city where 75% of the\ncontact teachers are male. Last\nFebruary I had the opportunity to\nspend a weekend in Cologne, where\na jam was also organized. It was a\npleasant change to encounter a jam\nwith 10 women and 4 men. I also\nparticipated in a workshop in\nBrussells, in which I was the only\nmale for the first two days, and one\nof three by the last day. Last\nDecember I participated in the Euro-\npean Contact Jam in Angers,\nFrance, where the proportions were\nabout equal, something like 18:17,\nand I am not sure which gender had\nthe majority. Now, in Angers, there\nwas one woman who was as\nfascinated by the gender question as\nmyself. She asked questions such as\n\"How does it feel, you men, to be\ndancers?\" and made statements such\nas \"I really like seeing two men\ndance together ... It is such a dif-\nferent energy than when two women,\nor a man and a woman are dancing\ntogether.\" Being one of the men\ndancing at the time this last state-\nment was uttered, I was brought\nabruptly to the realization that men\nand women are different. Well, of\ncourse I won't presume to say how\nwe are different. I do not often have\ndifficulties in telling men and women\napart, and if there is any lingering\ndoubt, I can always contrive to\ndance with the one in question and\ntake a gender energy reading. But\nprecisely what this difference is,\neludes me.\nHave you ever been told by\nanother dancer that he/she prefers\ndancing with men? Have you ever\ntold another dancer that you prefer\nmen? Have you ever told your\nparents that you prefer men? I hear\nthis preference often these days,\nmuch more often than a decided\npreference for dancing with women.\nAnd generally, the assertion of a\npreference for women partners in\nContact Improvisation is often ac-\ncompanied with the assertion of a\nspecific woman. I do not want to\nimply that this is a problem. It is not\na problem, unless you are not one of\nthe \"preferred dancers.\" After all,\nthere are men, too, that I do not\nwant to dance with.\nMany dance forms have been\ndominated by men.

    "Text": "Anthropologist Louis Dumont\nhas suggested that:\n\"The ideal of liberty and\nequality follows immediately\nf ram the conception of man as an\nindividual. In effect, if the whole\nof humanity is deemed present in\neach man, then each man should\nbe free and all men are equal . . .\nBy contrast, as soon as a collec-\ntive end is adopted by several\nmen, their liberty is limited and\ntheir equality brought into ques-\ntion.\"'\nDumont continues an analysis begun by\nToqueville of conflicts in American\nsociety, arguing that \"to adopt a value\nis to introduce hierarchy, and a certain\nconsensus of values, a certain hierarchy\nof ideas, things, and people, is indispen-\nsable to social life\" quite independent-\nly of \"natural inequalities or the\ndistribution of power.\" Consequently,\nthe ideal of equality, \"even if it is\nthought superior, is artificial.\"'\nDumont is proposing that the concept\nof equality among individuals will in-\nevitably be challenged by hierarchies\narising from social roles and social ac-\ntion defined by the very concept of\nequality. His argument does not defend\nthe use of power and control in hierar-\nchy, but rather attempts to separate\nhierarchy from the automatic associa-\ntion with power and control which it has\nin Western culture. Contact improvisa-\ntion embraced values of individualism,\nequality, and anti-hierarchical relation-\nships, but, if Dumont is right, one\nwould expect contradictions to appear\nbetween these values and the differences\ndeveloping from social roles and social\naction, even if no one takes power.\nIn the initial formation of contact im-\nprovisation, an egalitarian ethos main-\ntained itself, with Steve Paxton as the\nteacher. As the contact improvisation\nmovement developed, the looseness of\norganization within the movement con-\ntributed to an atmosphere of fluidity.\nAs Steve Paxton notes, people were free\nto come and go; for those who chose to\nbe involved in contact improvisation on\nonly a casual basis, not much was at\nstake. So long as no one was concerned\nabout the outcome of a performance\nother than to demonstrate the exciting\nnew dance form of contact improvisa-\ntion, and so long as the group of peo-\nple participating in the dance form re-\nmained a small group of friends,\neveryone could be viewed on an equal\nbasis. Contact improvisation could be\npracticed in both a social setting and a\nperformance setting by the same people.\nHowever, for those people who\nbecame involved with the dance form on\na professional basis, teaching and/or\nperforming to earn their living, a great\ndeal was often at stake. As the years\nwent by, many of those who had been\ndoing contact improvisation since the\nbeginning became teachers, and some\nbegan to form performance groups.\nThere was a spate of local group\norganization from 1977-79, as well as an\nincrease in touring by individuals gnd\nby ad-hoc groups. Both teaching and\nperforming established distinctions of\nroles within the movement. Differences\nbetween amateurs and professionals,\nbetween the less skilled and the very\nskilled, and between the social dancers\nand the performers developed. Lisa\nNelson, after talking about the \"folk\"\nnature of early contact improvisation,\ncommented, ''Eventually a lot of peo-\nple became teachers and that started to\nchange things ... if you'd been perfor-\nming, that kind of became a habit and\nyou wanted to keep performing ... after\na while, it took you away from just be-\ning 'a folk' and spending time with 'the\npeople.\"'Inevitably, the ideqlogy of\negalitarianism and spontaneity was\nchallenged by the appearance of implicit\nhierarchy and overt planning. The\ndemands of performing and operating\nwithin the professional dance world-\npromoting one's work, applying for\ngrants, seeking students-involved these\ndancers in somewhat different concerns\nfrom people who were participating in\ncontact improvisation for social and\nrecreational reasons.\nDancers were often differentiated\nfrom each other on a more informal\nbasis. Some emerging differences were\nsimply based on the level of skill of in-\ndividual participants: everyone began to\nknow who the most able dancers were.\nElizabeth Zimmer recalled her percep-\ntions of the contact improvisation jams\nin Vancouver:\n\"There was a hierarchy. Peo-\nple tried to pretend there wasn't,\nbut people who could really move\ngot to dance with the people who\ncould really move . .. like if I\nwould ask Andrew Harwood to\ndance, we would dance for a\nwhile and then he'd say he wanted\nto stop and then he'd go on to\ndance with somebody who could\nreally dance. So I'd consider it a\ngood day if I got a couple of\nminutes with Peter [Ryan] and a\ncouple of minutes with Andrew.\nSo there were people you didn't\nwant to dance with because they\ncouldn't, other people you were\nreluctant to ask because they were\nso good, and depending on how\nyou were feeling about yourself\non any given day, you took cer-\ntain kinds of risks.\"\nThose who were very skilled or very\ninvolved in developing the dance form\noften found their interests diverging\nfrom the increasing numbers of new and\nrelatively unskilled contact improvisers,\nas well as from those long-time im-\nprovisers who were primarily interested\nin socializing. For example, in 1979, two\nlarge gatherings of contact improvisers\ntook place. \"Current Exchange,\" a\nmonth-long meeting at the Western\nFront artists' cooperative in Vancouver,\nwas organized by Steve Paxton for\n\"serious students\" of contact im-\nprovisation. Those wishing to attend\nhad to submit letters to Paxton describ-\ning their activities and interests because\nPaxton did not want to teach or be in\na position of responsibility for the\ngroup. The conference involved danc-\ning, discussion, writing, and video-\nmaking, a full-time endeavor for peo-\nple with a strong involvement in the\ndance form. \"Country Jam,\" an event\nheld that same year on Vancouver\nIsland, was, according to Peter Ryan,\n''exactly the opposite of Current Ex-\nchange.\" Ryan, who attended and\nhelped organize both events, laughing-\nly described Country Jam as \"dance for\nthe proletariat ... it was homespun,\nthere was organic food and jamming\nevery day.\"\nEllen Elias, who attended Current Ex-\nchange, felt that it was \"elitist\" because\nof the requirement to write a letter, even\nthough everyone who wrote was ac-\ncepted. Among contact improvisers, she\nsays, \"there was a way of being elitist\nthat was subtle ... there was definitely\na sense of in-group, out-group, but it\nwas supposed to not be there.\" Like\nZimmer, Elias noted the social conven-\ntion of assumed equality which overlay\nthe existence of hierarchies.\nWhat is particularly notable about the\ncontact improvisation community is not\nthat hierarchies existed but that many\nparticipants were so conscious of them\nand disturbed by them. As mentioned\nearlier, many contact improvisers active-\nly promoted the idea that an experienc-\ned dancer should be able to dance with\nanyone and learn something from it, as\nwell as vice versa. At the 1980 Dance\nGuild Conference [\"Dance As Art-\nsport,\" in Minneapolis], many of the\nremarks at a gathering to discuss\n\"Politics and Contact Improvisation\"\nwere addressed to the problem of\n\"elitism\" and the \"exclusivist at-\ntitudes\" of the \"contact\nheavies.\"' People felt strongly that the\negalitarian aspects of contact improvisa-\ntion needed to be maintained.\nAs the years passed, cultivating a\nspirit of trust and caring between part-\nners remained a central component of\ncontact improvisation classes and jams,\nand extended to the social ethos of com-\nmunal organizations like Dance New\nEngland. On a social basis, it was\nstrongly felt that the participation of\neveryone in contact improvisation was\nnot to be sacrificed to the special\nabilities of a few people. But this ethos\nwas very difficult to maintain as a part\nof presenting the work publicly. *\n'Louis Dumont, Homo Hierarchicus\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966),\np. 11.\n'Ibid., p. 20.\n'Jerry Zientara, unpublished notes, 1980.\nPatrick Scully & Ellen Schelly of Contactworks, Minneapolis, 1977.",

    "Text": "When an apple fell on his head, Isaac Newton was inspired to\ndescribe his three laws of motion.\nThese became the foundation of our ideas about physics. Being essen-\ntially objective, Newton ignored what it feels like to be the apple.\nWhen we get our mass in motion, we rise above the constant call of\ngravity toward the swinging, circling invitation of centrifugal force.\nDancers ride and play these forces.\nBeyond Newton's third law, we discover that for every action several\nequal and opposite reactions are possible. Therein lies an opportunity for\nimprovisation.\nWe are looking at performance of Contact Improvisation, a duet move-\nment form. This tape takes a sweeping look over 11 years of practice by\nNancy Stark Smith, from her first exposure to the form I was working on\nwhen it was new in 1972, through moments chosen from consecutive\nyears of performing with me, Steve Paxton, and with others.\nNancy solos by testing her movement, playing with gravity and the\nfloor, which are, in this work, not taken for granted, but are considered\nconstant partners. She doesn't direct herself-she starts moving and then\nlets it happen, finding ways to cope with momentum and gravity.\nHere, in 1976, Nancy and her partner Curt Siddall move to follow the\npoint of touch as it moves-a basic focus for their improvisation. In the\nplay of moving and being moved, specific movements are unpredictable,\nbut they occur within a knowable field-of gravity, centrifugal force, sup-\nport and dependency.\nHuman touch unites the forces which act upon the body, with the sen-\nsations they provoke within the body. This interaction makes it possible to\nkeep all the parts of both their bodies harmonizing.\nThey were not so adventurous 4 years earlier. In this first performance\nof Contact Improvisation, they were getting used to moving by touch. By\nfeeling their way, they brought back clues about the form and about\nthemselves and their perceptions.\nThe performance which attracted Nancy to this form\nwas a high energy study called Magnesium. I made\nMagnesium tor a group of men at Oberlin College in_\n1972. It investigated the reflexive quality of touch, with\nmomentum, falling, rolling and colliding. .\nMagnesium ends with five minutes of standing, to\ndraw a great distinction in the scale of movement.\nStanding still is not actually \"still.\" Balancing on two\nlegs demonstrates to the dancer's body that on~ moves\nwith gravity, always. Observing the constant ad1ustments\nthe body makes to keep from falling calms the whole be-\ning. It is a meditation. It is watching the reflexes at .\nwork, knowing they are subtle and dependable-not 1ust\nemergency measures.\nStanding became one of our disciplines, keeping the\nmind attentive to the body's present moment. This sim-\nple practice was preparation tor the complex intera_ctions\nthat would arise with a partner. As were the throwing\nand catching practices that called for instant response,\nintroducing ourselves to adrenalized states.\nAt first, there seemed to be only two options-trying\nto follow the flow of communication or resisting it.\nEach dance is a series of on-the-spot decisions. And\nthey are on the spot. The soft skin is alert to the points\nof contact, signals telling the dancers where they are,\norienting them to their partner and the floor. .\nTheir perceptions are stretching. They are adrenal1zed.\nInside their minds, the many touch events and constant-\nly changing relationships blend i:ito a continuity _of mov-\ning masses which creates a logic reached only in the\nheat of the dance. A logic as secure as that found when\nstanding alone and watching the reflexive dance of\none's bones.\nHigher momentum brings new areas of risk. In order\nto develop this aspect of the form we had to be ~ble to\nsurvive it. The support needed from the unconscious\nreflexive parts of the brain is more present when the.\nconscious mind is not afraid. The calmness of standing\nis extended into the fall.\nThere are hazards. One of them is thinking ahead.\nWhat the body can do to survive is much faster than\nthought. .\nIt is useful to re-train the reflexes to extend the limbs,\nrather than contract them during a fall. During this very\ndisorienting fall, Nancy's arms manage to cradle her\nback, and this spreads the impact onto a grea_ter area.\nAnd she doesn't stop moving. That helps to disperse the\nimpact over a slightly longer time. She doesn't seem\nbothered.\nTaking a brief scan through time, we begin with. the\nfirst duet in which I danced fast with Nancy, dancing\nwith abandon and thrust to get into momentum. It seems\nrough and disorienting for her, but she was up for it.\nOne year later, the sensation of movement was more\ncontinuous, the flow of movement longer. There was\nmore time to feel what was happening.\nWhile in contact, we attend to our own reflexes, which\nhave been stimulated by the other's movements. Our\nreflexes move us, and this causes our partner to move.\nThis cycle of movement responses is continuous and\nforms the basis of the dialogue.\nWhen physical safety could be assumed at a more in-\nstinctive level, we were free to play with time and the\nsubtleties of touch. Phrases of movement could be ex-\ntended indefinitely when we no longer needed to stop\nand check our situation.\nBy 1978 we had examined the timing _of the body on\nits own for six years, and began searching for ways to\nchange our habitual patterns. Using music was one of\nthese ways. For this performance, Collin Walcott pl~yed,\nincorporating the random sounds of our movement into\nhis drumming. We danced to his rhythm, and he played\nto ours.\nDuring periods of extended soloing, we each expect\nphysical contact at any moment. We wait for the mo-\nment of decision to be taken by our partner or by\nourselves.\nOver the years, the principles underlying our move-\nment remain the same. As the senses expand into\nspherical space and the muscular system learns t~ res-\npond to touch on any surface of the body, any point can\nbe the fulcrum tor leverage and continuity.\nNancy and I have danced with many other partners o'.\nvarying backgrounds and skills. Each partner posed the1r\nown kinetic puzzles which were danced through, con-\ntributing new elements to the body of work, the network\nof Contact Improvisation.\nThe main focus of training is retuning the senses. It\nisn't just the sense of touch which must be expanded,\nbut all the senses must become elastic enough to\nnavigate through spherical space, to handle any posi-\ntion, any change of acceleration.\nIt seems that what has emerged is two bodies acting\nas one within the domain of the physical forces. Newton\nproposed ideas about the forces and their intera?tion. In\naddition, Contact deals with ideas or images which are\nsensations first, then felt by the mind.\nEvery person who has danced Contact Improvisation\ntaught their variation to their partners. This network\nspreads information among us.\nAs a member of the first generation to study Contact\nImprovisation, Nancy not only learned it but helped to\ndefine it by the direction her training took her. When she\nbegan, no one knew what sort of body would result from\nthe practice, nor what properties would be developed.\nWe have seen the first Contact event Nancy saw,\nMagnesium. This piece must have left an impression\nupon her, which in turn must have been altered by the\ndevelopment of the duet form.\nWe have been able to see Nancy's physical change in\nthe early years of her study, and the development of her\nperformance style. In looking at performance footage\nmainly, we have seen little of the daily work, but have\nseen the public forums in which Contact Improvisation\nbecame widely defined. In looking at Nancy's develop-\nment over 11 years, we've seen one strand of the\nphysically rigorous and interwoven structure of Contact\nImprovisation.\nAn important aspect of Contact Improvisation is the\npleasure of moving, and the pleasure of dancing with\nsomebody in a very spontaneous way. It happens in a\nframework which considers the body in all its variety as\nthe primary focus from which the mind can draw. With\nthis, the dance is refinable to ever more precise relation-\nships with the physical forces. *",

    "Text": "We don't need wine to get drunk,\nor instruments and singing to feel ecstatic.\nNo poets, no leaders, no songs,\nyet we jump around totally wild.\nthough it is immodest to claim, his acui-\nty puts him in the geneology of Contact\nImprovisation. Though some of Rumi's\npoems were written, most were im-\nprovised and came out spontaneously\nmetered and rhymed.\nIt's difficult to find a comprehensive\ndescription of Contact Improvisation.\nThere are adequate explanations of the\nphysical and functional aspects of our\ndance, yet there is always that element\nwhich can't be embraced with language.\nSeven hundred years ago Rumi recited\npoetry that to this day speaks to the soul\nof Contact.\nHere is a sampling of Rumi's poetry.\nIn the second group are poems that I feel\nhave a connection to C.I. In the Sufi\ntradition, another name for the medrese\nis the night school, following the idea\nthat we have a day mind and a night\nmind. The day mind does the laundry\nand pays the bills. The night mind is for\npoetry. These poems are ideally read\naloud, at night.\nThink that you're gliding out from the face of a cliff\nlike an eagle. Think you're walking\nlike a tiger walks by himself in the forest.\nYou're most handsome when you're after food.\nSpend less time with nightingales and peacocks.\nOne is just a voice, the other just a color.\nThe clear bead at the center changes everything.\nThere are no edges to my loving now.\nI've heard it said there's a window that opens\nfrom one mind to another,\nbut if there's no wall, there's no need\nfor fitting the window, or the latch.\nContact Improvisation has always\nbeen sheltered under the aegis, the pro-\ntection, of the founders' predilection for\nnot creating certifications, degrees, pro-\nfessional associations and strict defini-\ntions of the form. From a broad variety\nof sources, imagery is created, related\ndisciplines explored, points of view ex-\npressed, but absolutes are ultimately\ndismissed. How easy it would be to con-\ncretize into a set of exercises and rules\nthis protean dance form which at its best\nis fluid.\nIt is accepted but only whispered how\nContact is a metaphor for our lives and\nthat it has therapeutic value. Less talk-\ned about, and rightly so, are the spiritual\nelements, what we contact, or more\nlikely what contacts us during those\ndances that are out of our constraint,\nwhere a third body is created. Contact\nImprovisation, like Rumi's poetry, is\nlimenal, neither in balance nor over\nthe edge. His poems express the dances that\nare not predetermined, those rare\nmoments when the dancers disappear\nand there is only the dance. *\nLet the lover be disgraceful, crazy,\nabsentminded. Someone sober\nwill worry about events going badly.\nLet the lover be.\nOut beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,\nthere is a field. I'll meet you there.\nWhen the soul lies down in that grass,\nthe world is too full to talk about.\nIdeas, language, even the phrase each other\ndoesn't make any sense.\n[Special thanks to Coleman Barks for permission to use these translations.

    "Text": "As no two people are identical in\ntheir expression of Contact Improvisa-\ntion, styles and approaches toward\nteaching Contact are equally diverse.\nCollaborative teaching is a challenging\nsituation where the exchange of facilita-\ntion, structure and spontaneity is form-\ned by the communication between the\nteachers. The six facilitators of the\nworkshop had all been previously work-\ning in their separate home areas with\npeople of varying physical disabilities.\nWith the exception of Bruce Curtis's\nrelatively new practice of Contact Im-\nprovisation, we collectively had many\nyears of experience in teaching Contact\nto a wide range of students. As this\nworkshop was our first teaching col-\nlaboration with one another, we had\nquestions, but more so, an excited\ncuriosity about each other's ideas and\napproaches toward shaping the teaching\nmaterial.\nDay One\nWe began the first of the two day\nworkshop with an extended period of\npersonal entry and exploration of the\nvery large gymnasium. Spatial and\nperipheral alertness was gradually\ndeveloped. We encouraged individuals\nto improvise their personal warmup. At-\ntention to breath and the forces of gravi-\nty upon the body were emphasized.\nThere were a few people with previous\nexperience in Contact Improvisation,\ndisabled people in both manually-\noperated and motorized wheelchairs, a\nblind woman, a deaf woman, and others\nwith lesser physical limitations or injury-\nrelated conditions. Many others in the\nworkshop of approximately sixty peo-\nple were able-bodied and interested in\nContact as well as in learning within this\nparticular situation. There was a high\nlevel of enthusiasm and willingness to\ndevelop playfulness and physical con-\ntact. The speed was faster than we had\nanticipated. We began to slow the\noverall pace and look toward a deepen-\ning of the process through which we\nmove into contact with greater sensitivi-\nty and awareness. Those of us who\ncould fall and enter the floor did so,\nwhile others stayed in their chairs, relax-\ning into the \"small dance\" that can be\nfelt in a sitting position. The forms of\ncontact between able and disabled\nmovers slowly revealed the ways in\nwhich a person in a wheelchair often\nmust teach and become the initiator\nwhen their partner is feeling awkward\nand tentative. It seemed to be equally\nimportant to allow that partner time to\nget in touch with their awkwardness.\nAs we moved with one another in an\nincreasingly more mindful and physical-\nly alert manner, our specific strengths\nbecame more apparent. When Michael\nGoldhammer explained to me that his\nhead and neck muscles were the most\npowerfully developed extension of his\nbody, we both found much pleasure in\nfeeling the exchange of one another's\nstrength and support.\nLater in the morning, we had people\ncombine in small groups where each\nperson was gently rocked and rolled\nalong the floor. Particular focus was\nplaced on the head-neck joint, inviting\nrestful and fluid movement to be pass-\ned through the body. Counter-balancing\nwith a partner was also explored in\nvarious positions, each person using\nwhatever degree of movement and flex-\nibility they had in their arms. A person\nin a wheelchair could lean their weight\noff the side of the chair so that they\nwouldn't be pulled too far forward or\nout from their chair by their partner's\nleverage.\nIn the afternoon, Kevin and Louise\nintroduced a different form of a\ngauntlet (two parallel lines of people\nfacing each other) where one person\nslowly walked, wheelchaired, or crawl-\ned through the gauntlet from one end\nto the other while everyone in the lines\ngently blew upon their clothing and\nskin. Sensuality was a powerful and\ncommon feeling for us all. We held a\nround-robin toward the end of the day.\nThere was little reluctance to enter the\ncircle. We ended the day with a circle\nfor feedback and discussion.\nDay Two\nSunday included quite a few new peo-\nple. We began the morning in a quiet\nand more reflective mode. Karen led an\nextended warm-up that brought us into\nlight qualities of contact with one\nanother, maintaining a feeling of warm-\nup without further ambitions. Later, we\ncovered one half of the space with mats\nand introduced \"log-rolling.\" Everyone\nlies on their stomach, lined up next to\neach other with heads pointing in the\nsame direction, arms extended\noverhead. The contact between the sides\nof bodies is tight but flexible. One by\none, a person places him/herself in a\nperpendicular direction across the\nbodies. Before beginning to log-roll, the\njoined bodies gently nudge and ar-\nticulate some small movements upward\nto the person they're supporting to give\nthem a feeling of buoyancy. Then, the\nperson atop is carried along by the roll-\ning bodies until he or she reaches the\nother end. For those people who left\ntheir wheelchairs, this exercise was an\nexhilarating way to experience the sup-\nportive combination of body, ground,\nbreath and momentum, essential ingre-\ndients of Contact Improvisation.\nStaying on mats, we moved into part-\nner work, what we call \"low table\"\npositions. Here, one person is on hands\nand knees, while the other partner\ndrapes him/herself horizontally over the\nback of their partner. Gradually, either\npartner can initiate some movement,\nchanging shape and position in whatever\nway they are able. Relaxed but alert, the\nbodies can feel the force of gravity\nthrough muscles and bones. Higher sup-\nport positions were also introduced,\nallowing skills for falling and rolling to\nbe expanded upon. The level of trust,\ncommunication and safety was becom-\ning very apparent as we entered another\nround-robin. The dancing was accom-\npanied by some friends who played\nacoustic and synthesized music along\nwith vocal improvisations. The\nworkshop closed with a deep apprecia-\ntion for what we all created. The desire\nfor this work to continue was echoed\nthroughout the group. [Alan]\nIMPRESSIONS\nThrough the workshop, I learned\nabout a deeper level of being supported,\nand opening my body to trust the sup-\nport more, in more directions. This\ncame after working with Jessica, a girl\nwhose arms and legs have sensation but\ncannot bear weight without additional\nbracing or support. Her spinal and tor-\nso movement is fluid like a fish and we\nhad a great time cruising the space by\nrolling.\nWe discovered a way she could wrig-\ngle her weight onto me while working\nclose to the floor. Once I felt the center\nof her weight directly on top of me, I\ncould play with rocking her and shifting\nthe position of my support under her,\nraising the level of the support to hands\nand knees. For her it was slightly\ndelightfully terrifying-\"Don't! Don't!\nDO! DO! STOP! STOP! GO! GO!!\"\nSo I stayed within her limits of how\nmuch permission to take. Her fear was\nof falling on her head without any pro-\ntection from her arms while hanging\nforward across the bench my body made\nfor her. Then we played with shifting\nher weight towards her feet, just enough\nso she could feel the floor through her\nflat feet, with most of her weight still\ninto me. From here I crawled and she\nhad the sensation of walking, feeling the\nfloor pass under her feet while she took\nsteps.\nThere was something in her courage\nto trust my support and to follow her\ninterests that affected my dancing.\nLater, during a round robin, I had a\ndance with an able-bodied man I'd\nnever danced with before, David, where\nI gave my center in situations that are\nusually slightly delightfully terrifying for\nme-up high on a shoulder, hanging up-\nside down, the support moving with\nmomentum, no hands-and I felt deep-\nly relaxed.\nI just realized in rewriting this story\nthat I was in the same situation with\nDavid that Jessica had been in with me.\nWe truly do instruct each other through\nthe dancing. [Karen]\nIn reflecting back on what I now\nprefer to call the \"Dance with Different\nAbilities\" workshop rather than\n\"Dance with Different Needs,\" I ex-\nperience an immense gratitude for the\nopportunity to not know, to not assume\nmobility habitually and to appreciate\nmore deeply contact in still frames.\nLeading a class with physical assump-\ntions or habitual statements like \"Stand\nup,\" \"See the whole space,\" or giving\nany verbal instructions for that matter,\ncould at times isolate. A good sense of\nhumor was quickly cultivated. Verbal\ninterpreting for the blind, sign inter-\npreting for the deaf, and a multitude of\nmodifications allowed for a moment by\nmoment experience. Along with\neverybody else, I seemed to learn a lot\nabout replacing the use of one sensory\nperceptor with another. Seeing with\nyour skin could not become cliche. My\nperceptions began to expand through\nthe transmission of experience in this at-\nmosphere of diverse abilities. Consider-\ning the weight of a partner with a near-\nly total absence of muscular resistance\ngave me a profound experience of the\n\"small dance\" and enlightened me\nabout the sense of an abandoned body\nmoving through space where my will-\ningness and ability to support was essen-\ntial to the pleasure and safety of the\ndance. I also did a solo dance with a\nwheelchair, lifting it, rolling it over my\nback, balancing it on my shoulders. This\nallowed me to experience not only the\nspirit of the chair but how it was an ex-\ntension of its owner's body. The\nanatomy of a wheelchair, with or\nwithout a partner in it, was a great\neducation in mechanics, motion and\ncaring. The idea that contact improvisa-\ntion is an accessible movement form\ncontinues to expand in all directions\nregardless of one's physical abilities. A\nsense of common ground pervaded the\nspace.

Besides the basic sense of too much or not enough (alternately, I've been told by students\nhow there is excessive technical input or a frustration due to a casual and modest directive), we learn\nto use the word if it fits. Of course there is still much more to say.\nIn one of his first introductory classes, asking: \"ls the contact point the tension between trust and\nresponsibility?\" In agreement - yes, Danny, there seems to be many levels of lifting experience.\nDancing well with new students is the most advanced part of my learning.",

    "Text": "It is my first contact class after a\nseven year break and the first dance at\nall after months of painful resistance\nagainst any engagement in the moving\narts. A friend has convinced me to par-\nticipate in this Contact Improvisation\nworkshop taught by Nancy Stark Smith\nin Spain, north of Barcelona.\nVery slowly I settle back into the\nbody, keeping my vital forces way down\ninside. The air around me stays empty\nand my heart aches in consequence of\nneglecting its basic needs.\nThe teacher tells us to kneel down and\nconnect with the crowns of our heads.\nA tall young dancer with sea-blue eyes\nslips towards me and offers his head.\nOur bodies hardly move while we sit\nquietly tuning to each other. Through\nmy skull I feel the pulsation of his spinal\nliquid, the rhythm of his blood, feel my\nhesitant expansion towards him and\ndecide carefully to open up a little bit\nmore.\n\"Let's roll across the floor, keeping\nin contact with the top of our heads.\"\nGliding across the wooden surface we\nlook for a synchronized movement. His\nnose reaches already up into the air,\nmine still sticks to the ground.\n\"Now roll back to the other side of\nthe hall. Allow yourself to go slow;\nwhen you feel stabilized in your connec-\ntion you may want to develop a more\nopen dance with each other, from time\nto time coming back to the head con-\nnection.\"\nWe exchange no opinions about our\nway of working together. His attitude\nis serious and alert. We both focus on\nour task, intending to align our abilities.\nLike siamese twins we are rolling\nnow, grown together at the crowns of\nour heads. My brother starts to guide\nme through the space, passing arms,\nfeet, legs and torsos of other dancers.\nHe calls me internally and waits for my\nanswers. His touch is delicate and firm\nat the same time. I try to catch an ex-\npression of emotion in his face. His gaze\nis relaxed and empty, while he is diving\ndeeper and deeper into the realms of my\nintuitive self.\nReaching a rare level of trust I allow\nhim to hold me, carry me and let go of\nme. For a tiny second I am as happy as\na toddler. But as my mind is realizing\nthe long lost feeling, it vanishes under\nthe weight of memory.\nMy partner keeps moving. Inhaling\nthe fresh smell of his sweat I curl into\nhis lap and want to stay there, losing my\nsense of self, ready to slip back into the\nliquid warmth and timeless security of\na womb.\nHe keeps moving. He is obviously an\nexperienced dancer, unlimited in his\ngentle presence, clear in his direction,\nwhile my perception is flooded by im-\nages, feelings, rhythms and vibrations.\nLike a little boat I am rocking across his\nbody waves, feeling his bones and soft\ntissues communicating with mine. By\nnow my lungs empty completely. Each\nexhalation goes further and is\nsometimes accompanied by an un-\nconscious sound of agreement. Our\nbreathing patterns overlap, we lose\nculture and age, but I stay always aware\nof being a woman.\nFor the glimpse of a moment a silvery\nnet is woven around us by dashes of\nsunlight, spread all over our bodies. The\nnext minute we are blades of grass in the\nsummer wind, intermingling with the\ngroup energy. The two of us are not\nalone in this space-we touch others\nflying through their territory, grateful:\nly catching the arm that supports us the\nmoment we lose our balance. A little\nlaughter jumps out of my throat. Hey,\nbabe, life can be fun!\nNo reaction on his side. He always\nkeeps moving.\nFinally we discover our spiral spheres\nand now I am expanding completely.\nYes! Fun! Love! Spirals up and down\nand up again in different speeds and col-\nours. Spirals towards a subtle\ncompletion.\nOur bodies agree to finish the dance.\nGently we unwind the energy threads\nwhich carried the codes of body\nlanguage. A few more touches and\nswirls and thanks to the floor. Then:\nGravity and empty space.\nAs soon as the dance is over, the com-\nmunication system is fallen apart. Here\nI am with onehundredtwentyseven ques-\ntions I never dare to ask: Is a dance like\nthis daily life for him? Was the level of\ncontact my own projection? Did he en-\njoy the fluidity of our movements as\nwell? Which images arose for him?\nWhat did he learn?\nThe class continues, other dancers\ncome, but this first dance stays with me.\nMy questions unfold into an investiga-\ntion of relationship-patterns. Something\nhas been healed inside of me, has been\nreplaced by soft openness, curiosity and\na need for creative expression.\nIn the dew of the next morning I sit\ndown to continue the dance with my\ntype>,yriter. Across the printed letters my\neyes are wandering towards the milky\nbluish mountains in the distance. Birds\nbusy with being surround me and the\nheavy sneeze of a Spanish farmer echoes\nthrough the valley and is answered by\nangry barking dogs. *",

    "Text": "Deepening combines elements of\nwork that I've been doing in The\nTragertm Approach, Authentic Move-\nment, Re-Evaluation (CO-)Counseling,\nand Contact Improvisation. This work\nwas first presented in a class that I\ntaught with Danny Mack and Susan\nBrokaw at the 1987 Breitenbush Jam.\nI listened to literally hours of personal\ntestimony and feedback by highly ex-\nperienced contactors after this class,\nwhich indicated to me that I was \"on\nto something.\"\nThis work is not about the advanc-\ning of Contact Improvisation skills ex-\nclusively, although from the feedback\nI've received, it seems to be very effec-\ntive in that way. It can be applied in\nvarious movement contexts, from dance\nimprovisation to dance therapy. It is a\nvery specific structured form which\ndemands a high amount of commit-\nment, attention, and focus.\nWhat is Deepening?\nListening to another while they move\nis at the heart of this experience. Like\nAuthentic Movement, this form is about\none person putting their undivided at-\ntention on another, without judgement,\ncomment, or intentionally shaping their\nprocess. Simply being there with that\nperson with total commitment to\nwhatever they do, as \"witness\" to their\nprocess. Unlike Authentic Movement\nhowever, the \"witness\" uses not only\ntheir eyes to \"pay attention to,\" but\nalso their hands and (later) their bodies.\nWhy touch? Because touch gives a\nkind of information that cannot be ob-\ntained through just observing. I am not\nonly looking for the information that I\ncan get simply from how I see your\nmovement. This experience is deeply\nphysical. This kind of connection, this\nkind of \"being with,\" is not only\nthrough a visual mode, but includes the\nkinesthetic/tactile as well. It is the ex-\nperience of seeing, touching, sensing,\nand moving with, on all levels of so-\nmeone's body, from periphery to core.\nFeeling experiences which often arise\nout of this kind of deep, intimate shar-\ning are those of profound personal\nvalidation and support.\nPreparation\nI first have people pair up and I teach\nbasic Trager hands-on skills. With one\nperson laying on their back, the other\nplaces their hands somewhere on their\npartner's body and \"settles in.\" The\nfocus is on deepening the level of con-\ntact with one's hands through the sur-\nface structures of their partner's body\nsuch as skin and body shape to the\ndeeper structures such as skeleton and\norgan. Once this kind of contact is sens-\ned, the active partner begins to lightly\nrock the body of their partner, sensing\nfor the movement of the skeleton and\nthe pathways this movement is travel-\ning on. This works beautifully to drop\npeople into their body's core, and to\nengage them in focusing deeply into\nanother person's physical structure.\nThrough the work of Milton Trager, I\nhave learned that by developing sen-\nsitivity in the hands along with the\nfocusing capacities of the mind, the sur-\nface of the body can be penetrated\nallowing core structures to be contacted\nand moved.\nThis kind of \"penetration\" or depth\nof touch is necessary in the Deepening\nexperience. The intent, once this is ob-\ntained, however, is not to \"do\"\nanyt~ing with those deeper structures,\nbut simply to contact them, to listen and\nto follow what is happening in there\nwhile that person is moving.\nThe basic Deepening structure\nThe basic structure begins with one\nperson in the pair moving on their own\nand the other person observing.\nThroughout this whole experience the\nperson moving is focused on referenc-\ning everything to their own center, edge,\nflow, timing, weight, momentum, inten-\ntion, etc. In other words, they are solo-\ning. The person watching is following\nwith their eyes, the whole or any part\nof this person's body moving-wherever\ntheir attention is drawn.\nNext, the person observing moves in-\nto the other's kinesphere and begins to\nfollow the movement of any part,\n[touching it] with their hands. Here it\nis helpful for the person moving to work\nat a slow pace. This facilitates contact\nfrom hand to body. It is also important\nto note here that the person \"soloing\"\nis not initiating or \"leading\" the other,\nbut simply moving while someone\nmoves with them. They are paying at-\ntention to their own movement process.\nTheir partner is also paying attention to\nthe movement process of the person\nsoloing, with their eyes and hands and\nwhole being. This is an experience of\n\"one-way attention.\" In other words,\nboth partners are paying attention to\none person's dance. It sometimes re-\nquires an active intention on the part of\nthe person following to not initiate,\nlimit, or direct their partner's move-\nment, especially if they have had a lot\nof Contact Improvisation experience.\nNoticing the subtle ways in which we do\nthis in Contact Improvisation is one of\nthe benefits of practicing the Deepen-\ning form. This means that when a move-\nment is going outside of one's reach\nspace, the follower must simply let it go.\nTo pull the motion back towards oneself\nby changing the pressure would inhibit\nthe full movement of one's partner.\nIt is helpful for the kind of deep con-\ntact I spoke of earlier that the person\nApplying Deepening in a\nContact lmprov context\nIf I am working with a group of Con-\ntact Improvisors, I will have people\nfocus on bringing the experience from\nthe edge (hands) to the center (torso),\nand throughout the whole body. The\nperson \"paying attention to\" their part-\nner (while that person continues to\n\"solo\") begins to use the rest of their\nbody to follow, track, and read their\npartner's movement in just the way that\nthey were using their hands earlier. Here\nI make it clear that it is not about \"go-\ning after contact,\" but is about allow-\n0\n0\n_c\n0.\nTom Trenda & Bev Rackoff\nfollowing does not ,jump around with\ntheir hands, but rather rests on one body\npart, \"reading\" as much information as\nis possible about the whole organism\nfrom that one moving part. There is\neverything to be learned about a whole\nfrom any of its parts.\nOf course, it is a lie to say that the\nperson moving is \"soloing.\" As soon as\none is aware of being watched there is\ninteraction. And when one is being\nlistened to through touch, there is cer-\ntainly a presence there to be reckoned\nwith. But just as one can do a \"solo\"\ndance piece with many people watching,\none can also solo while being touched\nif the person touching has a presence of\nrespectful attention.\ning any body part that is convenient to\ncome into this role, as the movement\nflows through one's kinesphere. This\nprevents people from throwing their\ncenters into contact. It is O.K. to be in\nthe way of your partner's motion-you\nare a part of the environment in your\npartner's dance.\nIssues of weight support invariably\ncome up at this point. Torsos weigh\nmore than hands. If I am following a\nmovement with my hand I can be above\nor below it, without much change in\nweight. But if I follow someone's move-\nment with my torso to a place where I\nam on top of them, they are supporting\nmy weight, but I am supporting their\nmovement. Similarly, if their movement\ntakes them to a place on top of me, I\nfocus on supporting the movement, not\nthe weight. The focus is not on giving\nand taking body weight. This is often\nwhat makes Contact Improvisation so\nstatic: you give me your weight, I'll give\nyou my weight, and [thus] the dance of\nall the signals and responses associated\nwith this. Weight sharing is one by-\nproduct, just something that happens to\nhappen, in the process of reading so-\nmeone's movement with certain parts of\nyour body in the Deepening form.\nAt this point, I might suggest the\nsoloist begin playing with moving faster,\nchanging levels, and jumping. Or the\npartners can allow the roles to dissolve,\nkeep moving, and take from this struc-\nture anything they feel [like] integrating.\nI also structure sessions for specifical-\nly working on connecting in this\nDeepening way in running, falling, and\njumping. This seems to be very\nchallenging-to come into contact with\na quickly moving body without shaping\nthe course of that jump, run, or fall.\nThe outcome\nSome of the benefits of doing\nDeepening are rooted in the fact that it\nis about taking turns. How often do we\nget to receive such undivided attention\nto such a major part of ourselves? To\nbe supported in whatever we are doing?\nReceiving this kind of attention from so-\nmeone enables one to go deeper into\ntheir own body/movement process. This\nform creates a high degree of safety for\npeople to explore their own movement.\nAs the person moving, you get very\ncommitted to your own movement\nwithout a lot of ego investment. This\ncomes from someone else's commitment\nto your movement without ego. As the\nperson following, focusing one someone\nelse enables you to let go of any of your\nown stuff about your own movement.\nIt takes the focus off yourself and how\nwell you are dancing.\nThrough practicing this work a new\nrelationship to \"form\" can be\ndiscovered. It could be said that \"form\nfollows following.\" Awareness of form\ngrows organically from the inside.\nPathways begin to emerge through the\nskin and extend out of (and back into)\nthe body. It comes unself-consciously\nfrom the mutual commitment to follow-\ning each other's internal movement\npathways. *",

    "Text": "In the SUllllller of 1986, Bruce\nCurtis called me and introduced\nhimself as a physically disabled man\nwho had become very interested in\nContact Improvisation. He describ-\ned his previous experiences with this\nmovement form as well as his\ntravels within and outside of the\nUnited States. Without having met\nhim, I was already seeing Bruce in\nterms of the mobility and curiosity\nthat had led him to explore Contact\nImprovisation, a dance form that I\nhave been practicing, developing\nand teaching since 1974. I was also\nthinking of how I might interact\nwith a person who has spent more\nthan half of his life in a wheelchair.\nI knew that within myself and most\nable-bodied people, there exists a\nwide array of pre-conditioned\nresponses and behavior that has\nlimited and confused our interac-\ntions with disabled people. At the\nextremes of one's discom-\nfort/ awkwardness with disabled\npeople (and vice-versa), we may un-\nconsciously be physically distancing\nourselves, avoiding direct or sus-\ntained eye contact, or behaving in\nan overly protective manner.\nAs I viewed tapes of Bruce's\nearlier dances, I felt excited by the\npossibilities for developing a\nphysical vocabulary between us,\none that could challenge and ex-\npand previously held ideas about\nthe limits of movement for those\nwith spinal cord injuries. Bruce and\nI acknowledged that there was\nmuch more ground to explore, and\nwe began a regular practice of Con-\ntact Improvisation, a collaboration\nthat held equal amounts of en-\nthusiasm, caution and wonderment\nfor both of us.\nLearning where and how one's\nContact partner senses and carries\ntheir center of gravity is essential to\nthe development of trust and\nphysical rapport. Bruce's wheelchair\nwas an immediate part of that lear-\nning for me. The man and his\nwheelchair are definitely not in-\nseparable, and a constant awareness\nneeds to be maintained for intuitive-ly and· reflexively determining the\nboundaries and shifts of balance\nbetween Bruce's body and the struc-\nture of his chair. In another sense,\nI often feel Bruce's chair as an ex-\ntension of his total physicality, sen-\nsing the combined weight of body\nand chair as one moving mass. By\nplacing my arm, hand or larger sur-\nface area of my body, such as my\nback or hips, in contact with any\nsurface of Bruce's body, I gain im-\nmediate access to sensation, mo-\ntion, breath and balance in Bruce's\nbody as he moves in his chair. If my\nhand places a gradually increased\namount of weight around the side\nof, or at the back of Bruce's head,\nI can use his responding movement\nand weight exchange as it enters my\nhand (which is spread and channel-\ned throughout my entire body). I\nfeel and image his entire spine mov-\ning downward through the chair's\nseat cushion, feeling his spine\nrooting into the floor. There is a\ncorresponding upward movement\nthrough his spine and head into my\nhand, as contact and awareness of\nthese multi-directional forces of\ngravity and momentum are\nestablished. As both of us maintain\nthis bodily-felt relationship to\nweight exchange and shared move-\nment and stay open to sudden im-\npulses and influences upon either of\nour bodies, a playful, energetic and\ninnovative dance is created. An\nessential quality of improvisation is\nan appreciation for what is taking\nplace within the present moment of\none's awareness. Following our in-\nstincts and trusting our inherent\nbodily wisdom will guide us toward\nour next perception, feeling and\naction.\nAs our practice has continued\nduring the past year, Bruce and I\nhave become much less protective of\none another, more open about our\nconfusion, discomfort or expecta-\ntions. We move together, with\nBruce in and out of his chair, both\non the ground and at higher levels\nfrom the floor, where Bruce can be\nsupported around my hips or\nshoulders. Sudden lifts of Bruce's\nbody from either his chair or the\nground create momentum for spins\nand swift descents back to the\nground. We've practiced basic skills\nfor relaxing the body as we spill in-\nto the floor from higher support\npositions. As with many Contact\nImprovisation duets, the high\nvelocity of movement and risk bet-\nween Bruce and myself rriay sudden-\nly be experienced as a heightened\nstate of alertness and precision, our\nawareness of time and space relax-\ned and expanded, moving safely\nthrough our movement possibilities.\nBruce's wheelchair is surprising-\nly light and responsive to subtle\ndegrees of weight and momentum,\nalthough it is Bruce's receptivity to\nthose subtleties that determines how\nmy body and movement can shape\nitself with his chair. I have leaned\nand thrown my weight on Bruce\nand his chair from many angles and\nimpulses. We have occ\"asionally\nfallen onto one another's body and\nthe floor, with the chair somehow\ncooperating for our safety and con-\ntinued contact with each other.\nNeither of us have ever been injured\nin our dancing.\nOur warm-ups include taking\nweight across one another's back\nand hips, counter-balancing\nthrough the extension and grip of\neach other's arms and hands, slow-\nly stretching and releasing tension\nfrom muscle and joints. We focus\ndeeply on internal awareness of\nbreathing and finely-tuned balance.\nWhere certain areas of Bruce's\nspinal and muscular functioning is\nlimited, I have developed an in-\ntuitive capacity to locate those parts\nof his limbs and torso where he can\ninitiate movement, and direct the\nneeded amount of pressure to sus-\ntain our surface of contact without\nslipping or losing our communica-\ntion. Whether this limited physical\nfunctioning is within his fingers or\naround his pelvis, there is always\nenough time and attention for us to\nkinesthetically scan through our\nbodies for other areas of strength,\nsupport and balance. It is this \"scan-\nning\" that creates the movement\nvocabulary which is shared between\nBruce and myself.\nOur work together has been\nobserved and commented on by\nmovement and somatic educators,\ndance and physical therapists, per-\nforming artists and other people\nwith physical disabilities, both less\nand more severe than Bruce's. We\nhave performed before a variety of\naudiences within the San Francisco\nBay Area, most recently through\nThe John F. Kennedy Center's\nSpecial Arts International Program,\nat Grace Cathedral Church and at\nThe New Performance Gallery.\nUniversity and cable TV stations\nhave produced and aired tapes of\nour work. Exposed to Gravity:\nTwo Men Dancing, a video edit of\nour work, has been screened at\nvarious educational video festivals\nin the U.S., Mexico, Brazil,\nNicaragua and China. Our practice\nsessions and video tapes have been\nviewed by individuals and groups\nwho are interested in movement and\nbody awareness for those with\nspinal cord injuries.\nBruce and I do not look upon our\ndancing as a particular form of\nrehabilitative or therapeutic work,\nalthough those aspects and benefits\nare acknowledged and may be ap-\nplicable in working with other\ndisabled people and those who are\ninterested in movement education\nand disabilities. In our collabora-\ntion, there isn't any specific condi-\ntion that we are judging or attemp-\nting to change. Contact Improvisa-\ntion is very much of a self-informing\nmovement practice in which the\nparticipants are continually\nrecognizing and adapting to the\nchanging circumstances of their\nmutual dance. Bruce and I are con-\nscious of the kinesthetic and pro-\nprioceptive experiences that are for-\nming our individual patterns of\nmovement, as well as the quality of\nthe contact between us.\nNew movement capabilities in\nspinal-injured people is an issue that\nBruce and I have discussed with\ngreat interest and enthusiasm,\nespecially after we've danced. These\ndiscussions are filled with the im-\nages and sensations that linger long\npast the actual dancing. While\nBruce cannot outwardly move his\nlegs, I know that he can feel a cer-\ntain amount of pressure from my\nweight resting or rolling across the\nbones in his legs. A greater amount\nof my weight across the same area\nmay create some sensation or feel-\ning of contact with the floor beneath\nhim, as well as that same pressure\nsending sensation, feedback, im-\npulse and action to other areas of\nhis body. We do not have to stop\nand reflect on these sensations, as\nwe are continually listening through\nthe natural momentum that carries\nand sustains our dancing. What re-\nn;iains important to my participa-\nt10n and learning is that I maintain ~\nan active and attentive relationship\nto all areas of Bruce's body\nthroughout the time of our dancing.\nThere are no \"dead\" or unfeeling\nparts of Bruce in my relationship to\nhim as a moving human body who\nis as fully involved in the life of our\ndance as I am. Comparisons bet-\nween our abilities are limiting and\ntoo predictable if based solely on\nphysical skill and functioning. Our\nminds, hearts and creativity join us\nin deep and powerful ways, that in-\ntegrate and often transcend the ob-\nvious physical differences in our\nbodies.\nIn a Contact Improvisation\ndance, there are somatic activities\ntaking place on many levels of con-\nsciousness and perception. The\nglandular and neuromuscular\nsystems are being filled with sensa-\ntion, becoming a direct source for\nthe communication between still or\nmoving partners. What is happen-\ning while we are rolling, falling and\nguiding ourselves and partner via\nthe feedback exchanged through\nskin, nervous system and internal\norgans? As our body spins and sud-\ndenly shifts from standing or sitting\nin a chair to balancing on arms or\nhead, what accompanying changes\nare ignited through the body as\ncerebra-spinal fluid or adrenal\ngland activity pulses through the\nmoving partners? To what extent\ndoes emotional excitement play\nupon the ability to feel movement\nand expand ourselves motionally?\nIn my movement with Bruce, these\nquestions and interests arise and\nprovide direction for our future ex-\nplorations. I'm reminded of a par-\nticular image described by Bruce\nafter one of our practice sessions.\nHe referred to parts of his pelvis and\nlegs as having \"black holes,\"\nwhereby reaching through his senses\nhe goes \"fishing with the flashlight\nof my awareness\" into those black\nholes, in a sense, providing the\npathway for sensations to be felt.\nMovement can't be forced in any\nbody. Desire and risk are called\nupon if there is to be a deepened and\nmore fully conscious movement for\nany human being.\nAs we continue our collabora-\ntion, Bruce and I are interested in\nmoving with other disabled and\nable-bodied people, and in offering\nlecture-demonstrations and\nworkshops. We want to work with\nother individuals, groups and\norganizations who support the\ndevelopment of movement\narts/ education as a valuable and in-\nspiring basis for play and com-\nmunication for people of all levels\nof ability and disability. In these\nways, Bruce and I hope to further\nexplore and share with others a\ndance and dialogue that we have\ndelighted in. 0",

    "Text": "I had noticed the fluorescent flyers stapl-\ned to the walls of Fulton School. How could\nI miss them amid the otherwise drab chip-\nped paint on the walls? I picked up an orange\none from a table in one of the halls, studied\nthe collage which incorporated the Rich-\nmond skyline atop a pile of rubbish, then\nread its only words, \"Ram Cat Gallery,\" and\nwondered why I had never heard about this\ngallery before. Was this to be a new display\nspace for art?\nSeveral weeks later, Suzanne Nay, one of\nthe members of the group I'd been doing\nContact lmprov with, asked me whether I'd\nbe interested in participating in Ram Cat\nGallery. To her I addressed a barrage of\nquestions.\nDowntown Richmond is laced with a net-\nwork of alleys. Usually you only know the\none behind your apartment and the one\nbehind your workplace. Although I'm\nfamiliar with many more (they're great for\nevening walks), I had never encountered the\nalley called Ram Cat. It's a typical cob-\nblestone alley, out of the way, unknown but\nto a few, and like every alley, used regular-\nly by sanitation engineers. This section of\ntown like all of historic Richmond had its\npeculiar sites and stories. At one end of the\nalley stands a three story milk bottle,\nin 1913 the home of a dairy, and at the\nother end, the studio of Blab TV, a local\ncable show featuring philosophers\ner ... um ... publicly blabbing.\nSeveral artists, Suzanne one of them, had\nchosen Ram Cat as a site for visual artists,\nmusicians and performing artists to showcase\ntheir wares. Did I want to partake in this\nevent by doing Contact outdoors? I said yes\nand several days later, a few days before the\nshow, investigated the space which I quick-\nly found to be full of glass, parts of pipes,\nstrips of wood and a hodgepodge of other\nitems that would make dancing much more\nthan a challenge. After envisioning myself\nrolling across the ground, rising with my face\nand limbs bloodied by what I had en-\ncountered en route, I considered renegging\non my previous agreement. Art for art sake\nis fine but blood is blood.\nDespite promises of a cleanup, we who\nhad agreed to perform continued to enter-\ntain the idea of merely playing spectators that\nday, a much safer role. Then the carpet was\nrolled in and once unfurled, five gleeful\ndancers pou need on it to begin to ex-\nperience Contact in the wilds of a Richmond\nalley.\nRelatively new to Contact, I found alley\ndancing invigorating. How could I not res-\npond to the fifty-year-old, keyless piano (us-\ned as accompaniment for another dance)\nfound amid a pile of Coke bottles, men's\nshoes, t-shirts, tires, used condoms and other\nartifacts of American culture? Beneath two\ntrees growing out of brick walls, we tumbl-\ned, pushed, pulled, and leaped in response\nto each other but also in response to the sun,\nthe fresh air and to the angles of the buildings\nunique to Ram Cat.\nWhether we were conscious of it or not\nat the time, our dance was influenced by the\nenvironment. We all later agreed how the\nquality of our moves differed from those per-\nformed in our usual wooden floor, high ceil-\ning dance space. The cushion the carpet pro-\nvided made our more pedestrian moves such\nas walking and crawling more springy and\nmade falling less threatening. The slight in-\ncline of the ground sometimes contributed\nto the momentum and direction of a roll. Be-\ning outdoors, reminiscent of children on\nrecess, allowed us to be more playful.\nAlthough we more or less stayed within the\nconfines of the carpet, a space much smaller\nthan what we were used to, the diminished\nsize did not diminish the breadth of our ex-\npression. With the idea of performance in\nmind, we had earlier given ourselves a time\nlimit, but while dancing it was obvious that\nwe didn't want to stop.\nThe rawness of the alley suits Contact.\nContact is not sterile or refined, a manufac-\ntured product assuaging a public that wants\nart to be more or less predictable and\nbeautiful, pleasant enough to be displayed\nlike souvenirs from last summer's trip to\nEurope. Contact is more primitive, disregar-\nding etiquette and incorporating a full range\nof human expression. Bodies intermingle in-\ntimately continually. Bodies graze and press\nagainst each other with the ease of a chat\nand the impassioned eloquence of\ndiscourse. The aim of Contact is not to create\nforms, to reach toward lofty ideals or vulgar\nones, but to sustain a gestural communica-\ntion with another. The product, then, is the\nresult of dancers exchanging their weight\nand support with integrity, innocence and\nresponsibility. The power of the form\noriginates in its authenticity, in presenting the\ndance in its moment of becoming.\nThis, it seems, is where the element of im-\nprovisation comes in. Improvisation stems\nfrom a source that is not solely intellectual\nbut integral. Not only the mind but the body\ntoo generates the composition. The Carte-\nsian problem of dualism disappears, neither\nmind nor body attributed with greater heirar-\nchical importance. The composition is a fu-\nsion of the self as whole. Out of this concor-\ndance, spontaneous movements arise\nnaturally and last as long as the dancers are\nable to sustain its many evolutions.\nMore than any other dance form, Contact\nresembles life, at least my life with its cons-\ntant flux and need to make decisions within\na moment's notice. The improvisational\nmovements are organic, not polished time\nafter time in the studio, and are influenced\nconstantly by whomever I come in contact\nwith.\nThe alley has contributed to the group's\ngeneral knowledge of Contact. I know also\nthat it affected some of the spectators.\nSeveral days after we had danced, a friend\nof mine mentioned how she had gone to a\nmuseum and left after ten minutes. Her\nreason: the controlled and lifeless environ-\nment contradicted the intention of art. She\nhad been touched by the vitality of the alley.",

    "Text": "At some point in the growth of Contact Improvisation\nthere was a call for definition, rules, a clear way to identify what\nwas {or wasn't) Contact Improvisation. (\"There are no lines,\nonly edges.\" Ansel Adams) Only a few years after its inception,\nContact seemed to be spawning generations of contacters so\nquickly as to be involved in some kind of 'telephone game'.\nJohn tells Sally who shows Sue who passes it on to her brother\nwho tells his wife who shows their kids who bring it to school\nthe next day for recess. If John were walking by the schoolyard\nat noon, would he recognize anything familiar going on in the\nplayground? For all the interest in defining Contact Improv-\nisation, the answer to that quandary is in watching a contact duet\nbetween two dancers who have just met. The definition is in\nthe doing.\nContact bases its language on the natural laws that govern\nmotion (gravity, momentum, inertia, etc.). With these laws as\nour constitution, we have no need for legislation. The natural\nworld enforces its own laws - drop a book, consciously or not,\nand it wil I fall. Clearly, Contact Improvisation is not the begin-\nning or the final stage in the opus that relates the body and its\nmovements to the earth and the other movers on it. The truths\nwe find in Contact, whether basic or elevated, are truths that\nexist with or without Contact Improvisation as a means for re-\nvealing them to us. Often in the enthusiasm of the work it is\npossible to forget that bodies moving in contact are not new.\nIt is, however, the continued focus on the elements involved in\nthat contact, techniques for it, applications of it, that is specific\nto Contact Improvisation.\nMaking a magazine (CQ) for the exchange of information\nand viewpoint instead of making a congress, allowed the various\nsubtexts that existed to emerge and be shared. As a technique\nfor moving together, Contact resonates in the lives of the prac-\ntitioners. Those resonances are personal and varied, and though\nthey enrich the work, the basic practice seems unchanged.\nAfter 6 years, Contact Improvisation continues, with\nor without music, in twos, threes, in groups with a name or with-\nout. Contacters have gathered in bodies, regional families, to\ncorroborate and continue. A context has developed similar to\nsocial dancing wherein people can come together and 'jam'.\nTiirnugh Contact Quarterly a network exists, making known\nplaces where Contact can be found. When a poker player comes\ninto a new town, he looks for the game.",

    "Text": "I have a recurring dream that I\nam teaching dance to a large group\nof students who aren't interested and\nkeep leaving the room until only one\nor two remain. In the dream, I feel\nconfident and strong about my\nmaterial but am struggling to com-\nmand people's attention. Different\ncharacters people this dream, both as\nstudents and observers. Sometimes\nmy former dance teachers from New\nYork, Murray Louis or Phyllis\nLamhut, appear and criticize me.\nOne time my mother was one of the\ntwo students who remained at the\nend of the class. Sometimes I feel\nbad about everyone having left,\nsometimes relieved. The last time I\nhad the dream, I knew that the peo-\nple who stayed really wanted to be\nthere.\nRecently I lived out this dream.\nDuring the winter I taught a Sunday\nmorning series called \"Making Con-\ntact,\" open to new and experienced\ncontacters. In the class flyer I\ndescribed Contact Improvisation as a\nmovement form integrating\n\"elements of dance, play, martial\narts and developmental movement in\na concrete way that allows us to\ncelebrate moving and to explore both\nour individuality and our in-\nterdependence with other people and\nour environment.\" During the past\ntwo years I have incorporated into\nmy Contact classes my growing\nunderstanding of developmental\nmovement patterns and the interrela-\ntionship of body systems, cognitive\ninformation and deeply felt\nknowledge gained through my study\nof Body-Mind Centering•m. With\neach new level of discovery in my\nown learning process, I amend my\nclass descriptions, wanting to attract\npeople whose personal discovery pro-\ncess will mesh with and expand upon\nmy own.\nLast winter's series began with\nabout 12 people, some with a fair\namount of Contact experience, some\ntrained dancers with minimal Con-\ntact experience, and some without\nany Contact background at all. The\nfirst-timers were scared and said so\nin our first check-in circle. They\nweren't quite sure why they were\nthere, what would be asked of them.\nThe only man in the group, a novice\ncontacter, worried about being the\nonly man. Others wanted to be more\npresent in their bodies, but were\ndaunted by their sense of vulnerabili-\nty in the group or their fear of in-\ntimacy in working with a partner.\nSome people could only sign up for\npart of the series, a situation I un-\ncomfortably allowed because I felt it\nwas the only way to fill the class.\nNevertheless, the first class went\nwell. People candidly verbalized their\nexcitement as well as their discom-\nfort. We worked deeply and gently\non cellular awareness, yielding into\nthe floor and through a partner to\nthe floor. We practiced thrusting in-\nto the resistance provided by a part-\nner's body. By the end of the class,\npeople seemed satisfied and expand-\ned, more confident about their abili-\nty to take care of themselves and to\nlearn in this environment. I relaxed\nabout the class, feeling that the\ngroup's energies would mix well and\nthat the more experienced would\nboth encourage and learn from the\nbeginners.\nOne woman never came back. On\nthe phone she told me that the class\nwas too scary for her. Over the\nweeks more people came and went.\nNever knowing exactly who or how\nmany would show up, I felt bullied\nby the inconsistency. I wanted to be\nopen to the energy at hand, but was\nsubtly angry that I couldn't count on\npeople at the very least to be there. I\nfelt unmet, frustrated that I couldn't\ngenerate momentum by building on\npreviously taught skills. It was like\nteaching a perpetual first class.\nBy the last class of the series only\nsix people remained. And during that\nclass, even the few remaining people,\none by one, began to leave. Someone\nslipped out of a group improv in\nwhich people had the options to\nmove, watch or draw. When I went\nto tell her good-by, she \"playfully\"\npunched me in the stomach, saying\nshe had left a drawing for me. I\nlooked at the drawing and found it\nfull of anger about how I had led\nthat day's class.\nI could hardly focus on the three\nremaining women, still entwined in a\ntender, playful dance. When we\nfinally- gathered in a circle, I shared\nhow difficult it had been for me to\nremain present with the dancing\nwhile others left the class. They said\nthey had been so engrossed in what\nthey were doing, that they had not\nnoticed the others leave. They\nassured me that they had had a\nwonderful time, told me how much\nthey had learned through the whole\nseries, and encouraged me to keep\ndeveloping the work. As they spoke,\nmy little-girl feelings of shame and\nabandonment drained away. I realiz-\ned that I had been paralyzed by\n\"shoulds,\" voices in my head like\nthe voices of my former mentors in\nthe dream, criticizing my choices as a\nteacher, telling me how I had failed\nto deliver.\nIn the weeks that followed, people\nwho had disappeared from class and\nsome who had seemed ambivalent\ncalled to tell me how important the\nwork had been to them and were\neager to sign up for the next series. I\ncould see that in allowing more parts\nof myself to be present in class, I\nhad opened the door for more parts\nof everybody to be there. However, I\ndidn't know how to fully support\nthis process which, while sometimes\nallowing people to tap into nurturing\nand delightful movement, at other\ntimes brought them up against their\ndeepest patterns of discomfort.\nI have always understood Contact\nImprovisation as a healing activity.\nThrough my study of developmental\npatterning, I now understand more\nspecifically that I was drawn to Con-\ntact not only by love of movement,\nbut also by my vast unsatisfied need\nfor nurturing, non-sexual touch,\nespecially for compression, the kind\nof pushing into the body that, as in-\nfants, tells us where we are, gives us\nour sense of self. Pushing against\nresistance allows us to develop the\nstrength to reach beyond ourselves\ninto our environment. While modern\ndance training helped me reclaim my\nbody as a source of learning and ex-\npression, Contact Improv satisfied\nmy need to connect with others\ndirectly, through bodily sensation\nand the physical laws of motion that\naffect us all. Having the weight of\nmy adult body met, I rediscover\nbaby joy, trust and expansiveness.\nYet, offering ourselves these\npleasures may restimulate old hurts,\nfears and unresolved conflicts that\nlive in our tissues, in the very pat-\nterns of our movements. The people\ncoming to my classes these days are\nnot necessarily dancers or even\n\"movers.\" They are people on a\npathway of personal growth, in-\nterested in expanding the range of\nchoices in their lives. Many have\nmapped their emotional, spiritual or\nenergetic terrain, but still experience\ntheir bodies as largely unexplored\nterritory. They want to understand\nhow inner movement translates into\nmovement in the world of form,\nspace, objects and relationships.\nThey may appreciate the importance\nof hanging out with emotional or\nspiritual discomfort in order to free\nup old patterns, but may never have\nexperienced this process in their\nbodies, challenged by gravity,\nmomentum, and other people's\nphysical presence.\nIn my classes I had created permis-\nsion for people to move with their\nbodies' desires. But at some deeper\nlevel in myself, I was still taking\nresponsibility for the \"success\" or\n\"failure\" of the class. Judging that\nsuccess (and myself) by how unified\nthe energy of the room felt, how ful-\nlly people disclosed their experience,\nhow much they said they had learn-\ned, what the dancing looked like, I\nwas still not comfortable with each\nperson having their own experience\nof the class. Because my sense of\nself-worth depended on my judgment\nof the feeling in the room, none of\nus were completely free to enjoy the\nsense of individuality which would\nsupport our interconnectedness.\nGradually, I have come to ap-\npreciate in my teaching what I ex-\nperience in my dancing: meeting\nresistance, physically and emotional-\nlly, creates support. Defining a\nboundary-where you end and\nsomething or someone else begins-\nempowers you to reach beyond your\nown kinesphere, past the edge of\nyour known experience. Yet, at\nanother level of perception, what ap-\npears solid and static can be perceiv-\ned as spacious and moving: a wall or\na person that seems an impermeable\nbarrier may be viewed on the\nmolecular level as many small\nvortexes of energy with vast spaces\nin between. At this level, the very\nidea of \"boundary\" loses meaning,\nthe \"resistance\" shifts, perhaps\ndisappears!\nContact work engenders such\nperceptual shifts; to integrate them\nrequires a safe environment where\nwe can learn to listen to and trust\nour bodily experience without fear or\nself-judgment. Recently, my learning\nprocess has included the ReParen-\nting'm work of Constance Abbott.\nBody-Mind Centering taught me that\nsupport precedes movement.\nReParenting encourages people not\nonly to understand and feel what\nmessages we needed and deserved to\nreceive from our families at different\nstages in our development, but to\ncreate situations in our adult lives\nwhich can provide the support we\nmissed then and need now. It is, in\nsome ways, a reframing process: we\nlearn to look at our experience dif-\nferently and can then choose to act\ndifferently, to not perpetuate pain.\nContact Improvisation, Body-Mind\nCentering and other body-based\neducational and therapeutic modes\ntake us beyond a mental reframing\ninto the physical experience of how\nmessages-both past and current-\nare encoded in our bodies. When we\ncan feel movement patterns, we can\nallow them to dissolve on a cellular\nlevel, a tissue level, and reclaim the\npower of active choice, balanced by\nreceptive flow, in our movement and\nour lives.\nIn last winter's classes, I had\ncreated permission for my students\nand myself to follow inner desires, to\nenjoy movement, to meet resistance.\nBut I hadn't known how to establish\nenough safety for all of us to hang\nout at the edge of our comfort zones\nand to let movement happen from\nthat edge.\nFor many people, the mere fact of\nparticipating in a group is unsafe.\nGroups are often places where our\nbodily experience must be repressed\nor denied. As the main model for\ngroup interaction in our society, the\nnuclear family provides a setting-\nechoed in schools, workplaces, and\ncommunity groups-where members\nare often ignored, stifled or actively\nabused. We have few models for get-\nting our individual needs met while",

    "Text": "Let me see. I gather egalitarianism\nand hierarchy are opposed in the title\nof Cynthia Novack's columns in the last\n\"Still Moving\" section [\"Egalitarianism\nand Hierarchy in Contact Improvisa-\ntion,'' CQ Vol. XIII no. 3]. I fear a trip\nhas been laid on us by some free-\nassociating dance critic who once\ndescribed CI as more democratic than\nother dance forms. I sort of remember\nthat line getting picked up by subse-\nquent reporters-freecwheeling, dance\nfor folk, etc., that kind of image aris-\ning uncensored, unexamined and\nperhaps unverified. In fact, until\nNovack questioned me recently, I don't\nrecall any of the many dance writers\nasking about this point.\nEgalitarianism resulted in democracy,\nour 'form' of government. This was op-\nposed to monarchy-Geo Washington\nwas offered the monarchy for the states\nof America, I once learned. So that sort\nof hierarchy was avoided by democratic\ngovernment. But a hierarchy, a tern~\nporary one, is what we use to run the\ncountry.\nI believe I agree with Dumont's thesis.\nAgreeing on values creates constraints\non individual directions. And humans\nare a communicating animal-we get\njerked out of our path by far more sub-\ntle events than agreeing on values.\nSometimes for good, sometimes for ill.\nA pause, a glance will do it.\nI have noticed that hierarchies are\nnoticed by those outside them. This sug-\ngests that those who make them up are\nto some degree ignorant of that fact, or\neven that they are projected on a group,\nor faction, or gathering, or team, or\ncommittee by someone who perceives\nthe association as hier-. Or rather,\nhigher.\nNow no one in these stories is dead;\nZimmer, Elias, Ryan, Harwqod or\nmyself; it would be possible to ask some\ndirect questions of all of us. For in-\nstance, who organized the situation\nZimmer attended? I'll bet Ryan had a\nhand in it. Harwood and Ryan are both\nmovers and shakers in the Canadian\nContact Improv. scene and it seems to\nme no Contact scene could exist without\ndeep bonds existing-I mean people\nmust enjoy dancing together in order to\nhave it survive for over a decade. Zim-\nmer probably wasn't the only beginner\nwho wanted to whet their skills on those\ntwo, and probably not the only one to\nemotionally defer to their skills.\nElias says there was definitely a sense\nof in-group and out-group at the Cur-\nrent Exchange gathering [in Vancouver,\nB.C., summer 1979]. I can vouch that\nthere was such a situation. The in-group\nconsisted of any one who had a long\nassociation with the idea of CI and had\ntoured and/or taught with the others.\nThe out-group were in such a group for\nthe first time. They were a bit at sea.\nThey didn't know how to act and since\nthere are no rules as such, no one told\nthem. The nice things about rules,\nschedules, etc. is that they limit the\nnumber of choices one has to make. If\none may act any old way, a bewilder-\ning situation may exist. Those who\nweren't bewildered were in. Those who\nwere bewildered saw themselves as out.\nIf Current Exchange was elitist, it was\nonly in the sense that the entire U.S. and\nCanada was not invited. In fact, living\nconditions restricted the size. Word was\nquietly put out to a few people who told\na few other people. A letter of intent\nfrom participants was required to insure\nthey had their own reason for using the\nfacility (Western Front\nLodge/ gallery I studio/ video) and that\ntheir reason resonated with the facility\nand harmonized in practical ways with\nthe rest. Every one of us paid for the\nrent of Western Front and pitched in for\nfood, cooking and cleaning up.\nI fear that the article, in using these\ntwo examples, will give elitism a bad\nname. Surely just being a small group\nor being buddies is not cause to bring\nout such a big gun. To be elite is to hold\nsome plum and restrict its dispersal. To\nuse this word to criticize those who go\nto the trouble of organizing classes or\nwho attempt to specialize and concen-\ntrate is to disparage a kind of grass roots\ncommunity work.\nZimmer and Elias will be amused to\nlearn that they have been placed in an\nelite, at the top of a hierarchy, recent-\nly. In Berlin at the 4th annual Contact\nConference (they decided to drop the\nword 'improvisation', to my despair).\nA European delegate asked if all Euro-\npeans could do with Contact was repeat\nwhat the first generation had done. So\nit goes. Zimmer and Elias are, to\nEurope, first generation contactors.\nAnd this is an example of a hierarchy\nbeing perceived from without.\nTruth be told, CI is a dance form. It\ndoes have and, as far as I am concern-\ned, teach certain values; mostly to do\nwith physical safety.\nCI has always abounded in logical\ncontradictions, foremost to do with im-\nprovisation. If improvisation springs\nout of each moment in each individual,\nthen how to get people to improvise-\nto discover their own initiative? And I\npoint this out in classes-this cannot be\ntaught, but it can be learned. I can help\nwith the physical part. I can provide\nuseful (to me, at least) images and\nmeditations. I can point out glaring er-\nrors in partnering. I can't know how so-\nmeone feels or protect them from their\ninsecurity, fear, dislikes, associations,\nboredom, or their elation, warmth,\nsense of achievement, for that matter.\nContact Improvisation deals with\ngravity, momentum, human bodies, etc.\nHumans form or perceive hierarchies.\nIt is egalitarian. The folk who aren't in\nContact Improvisation, either don't\nknow about it or choose not to do it.\nTo pick at words just a bit more, Con-\ntact Improvisation could not have \"em-\nbraced values of individualism, equali-\nty, and anti-hierarchical relationships,''\nbecause CI cannot do anything. It is\nsomething to be done.\nAnd in Dumont's remark some\nstrange loose ends, which perhaps\nshould be brought to the attention of the\nU.S. government and of course, its\nboss, the people: \"If, in effect, the\nwhole of humanity is deemed present in\neach man, then each man should be free\nand all men are equal. By contrast, as\nsoon as a collective end is adopted by\nseveral men, their liberty is limited and\ntheir equality is brought into question.\"\nSo apparently even a government\nformed on values such as freedom and\nequality will trample on freedom and\nequality. How embarassing. Yet even\nsuch an experiment in good intentions\nis of some interest, compared to the in-\ntentions of other governments, then and\nnow. If liberty and equality are chosen,\nthen at the moment of choice, they ex-\nist. What happens the next moment is\nsomething for all of us, anthropologists\nespecially, to ponder. *",

    "Text": "On Saturday afternoon August 20, 1977, some thirty participants and teachers of FOCUS 8/77 gathered\nto talk about the Politics of Contact. The issue was as much one of defining the question or concern as it was coming\nup with an answer. The discussion began with a minimal definition of politics: awareness of and concern for the\npower relationships in a given interaction or situation, particularly those relationships which are unacknowledged.\nor assumed and unquestioned. From this beginning the discussion was wide-ranging, spirited and largely unstructured.\nGoing back over a ta pc-recording of the seminar a month later, I have selected out and arranged (without\nregard to original sequence) representative and provocative comments to share with the larger contact community.\nTo my knowledge this discussion was the first attempt to look at our work from this perspective and clearly it is only\none small step, but an important one. In retrospect, I saw our talk centering around two issues.· The first was seldom\ndefined as a focus but kept surfacing in people's comments: what kind of needs are filled by contact improvisation'?\nConsuelo: I was interested in figuring out why it's come down that because of privilege like the $125\nprivilege and the class background privilege, why it is that this environment has developed around\ncontact; but I don't see that contact itself is this white cultural kind of ...\nJohn: I'm not sure I agree with that, for one thing it's demonstrating the needs ... contact like anything\nelse is fulfilling certain needs.\nEleva: That's what I was going to say earlier, perhaps it's the white middle class that needs to get in touch\nwith their bodies.\nTom: What I see it gets down to is am I willing to go into the world receptively and attentively to what's\nhappening around me and to be in touch with my needs in a particular situation and other people's\nneeds. I really think it is something about the reason we're here is because we need to be here, else\nwe wouldn't be here, to learn whatever we're getting from this, and I see it very much in spiritual terms ...\nthis group of people is here to get what we're getting and I think a lot of people don't need it or are\ndoing it in another form.\nElizabeth: The same kinds of things that happen in contact are things that I think have happened to other\nkinds of people in other situations, like in work situations where men do heavy physical work together\nand might have to use their bodies in the same kind of cooperation and same kind of sensitivity to each\nother ... but different than a dance situation ... which comes with a different kind of awareness.\nBroni: Its purpose is different too.\nMark: This may relate to why this kind of event is strictly one ethnic group or one social class. I'm con-\ncerned in society all over the country how it seems there's a great gap between this kind of situation\nof workshops and focusing on a specific kind of dance and what I would call the masses ... their\ndesire to move and to socialize and be part of something which is being generally exploited. For\nthose people who are not coming to studio spaces and being part of something, the whole word dance\nmeans to them Friday night and swallowing a six pack of beer and going to a bar or disco; I think\nit's exploitative and I really feel there's a gap between that space and this space and it's really tough\nto breach.\njerry: Contact has a lot in common with folk art and we are a folk ... we invent it as we go along, we\nmake it out of what we've got and the fact that what we've got is a college education, and money,\nand attractive healthy bodies, and good teeth, you know, is different from having a bunch of ma-\nhogany trees and a couple of rocks ... Contact improvisation has roots in dance, it was found by\ndancers, and it has gone away from being a dance thing; it is a movement form. There are people\nhere who are not primarily dancers and the form is reaching out toward those people the way some\npeople seem to think we should be reaching out toward different classes of society or different\nethnic groups.\nMark: I feel that there are some aspects of this kind of dance that are slightly different than any kind of\nparticular outlet that supplies the needs for any particular ethnic group. I really feel that there are\nsome aspects of contact that are evolutionary .. I can't think, unless somebody can fill the space, of\nother kinds of dance in the past which have been this free with sharing and this much touch and con-\nnections .. I think this kind of dance is more significant in specific kinds of problems, like sexual\npolitics, for example, men dancing with men ... and even in the sense that it doesn't rely upon other\nforms like music - goes right to an essence or centering ... This form of dance crosses a few more\nbridges than others have.\nConsuelo: You mean in the sense that it is kind of like a future vision of how people can relate to each\nother in terms of sensitivity and activity?\nJon: In terms of sexual politics we're still dealing with one on one, two people getting together, and contact\ngives you metaphors for expanding that to three or four or ten or twenty or whatever and that should\nbe explored too. ·\nKeriac: Watching a ballet that gets into these boy.girl things, I don't get much metaphor for my life from\nthose; whereas I really find the material in contact, the interpersenal stuff that's happening in contact,\nis a really useful sophisticated metaphor for what I'm experiencing. ·\nConsuelo: Right now I feel really committed to art for change. It's really not enough to do a contact\nperformance for me, it really isn't. I feel like I want to know more what's going to come out and\ndeliver a message; and I don't mean just whatever message is there but I mean pretty specific messages.\nKris: There's something about pure energy that gets exchanged between people, we become something\nof everything we are around, and when I see a performance I become those performers; and it means\na lot to me and it's the strongest and most pure learning experience I have and it's devoid of content.\nIt's not statements.\nConsuelo: Well, that sounds like a pretty powerful statement.\nI see that most of these needs in relation to contact have to do with the desire to break down the uneven\npower of the various roles that people assume in relating to one another, be it male to male, dancer to nondancer,\nor performer to audience. Contact improvisation as a political process can thus be seen as a means for bringing\npeople together in a way that prevents or at least discourages the assumption of roles and inequalities of power\nwhich roles so often establish. There seemed to be agreement that, on an immediate personal level, contact achieved\nthis aim if the integrity of the physical form was respected.\nThe second issue of the discussion seemed to center around the kind of relationship the contact community\nand the contact form is establishing with the larger society. Does and will this relationship maintain the same freedom\nfrom inequalities in power and thus allow all people access to the vital (role-less?) movement relationships which are\ncontact improvisation?\nKaren: The way to deal with it is to work on both levels - one is on the normal ground level of literally\ndealing, believing that change takes place and revolution takes place within my own body first and\nthen at the same time being aware of where my body is: is it in the studio, in Cat's Paw, and that\ndoor is closed unless I have $125, and then what do I do about that; and I think there are two dif-\nferent issues and both are necessary.\nBrent: But we made this experience available for ourselves ... at least I did.\nKaren: Because it is within your program in life to be able to do that. We're talking about a whole part\nof the world where it isn't part of the program - it's not there ... so is art going to be something\nwe're talking about, an eclectic thing that stays where it is, or can this particular art form go out\nbecause it doesn't have to have all that professional dilettantism that other forms have. Can it just\nbe a way of reaching people on another basis?\nLaurie: Not right now.\njohn: This is a white middle class trip and other people out of that might not necessarily want to have it.\nLaurie: And they might and they can't because they can't afford to.\nJohn: That's not true.\nLaurie: If one person wants to and can't ...\nJohn: There have been set up free situations for people to study this and it is only taken by white upper\nclass people. '\nErnie: Sometimes it becomes a real trip that we are laying on them because we don't have the sensitivity\nto know what they need.\nMark: What is the balance between being crusaders for contact and making it an available form for those\nthat are interested?\nJohn: It is a manifestation I think in many ways of class differences and therefore class problems that we\nshould deal with; solutions are tough.\nEvelyn: Most of the arts are a social ... I mean there's a certain class of people that do them. For a long\ntime they were a very elitest thing.\nErnie: But is it elitist? That word really blows my mind cause it's a power term. It assumes that if we\ndevelop a dance form, it is automatically elitist. It's a dance form! ... something that came out of\nour culture. Our culture may be elitist in a lot of ways - money and social structures generally, but\nthat doesn't mean the dance form is elitist.\nLaurie: But it reflects the society.\nKaren: I am forever grateful in one way, in an aesthetic sense, and in other ways, for things that have come\nout of formalized, in a sense elitist, art forms and I value them. Then I hear what we're saying on the\nother side. Now is there room for both ways to be?\nKeriac: If you are thinking of contact as a folk art and experiencing it, it is quite a different setup than if\nyou are thinking of it as a performing art or a spectator thing. Like Karen was talking about, how can\nwe have both of these things, that they both enrich our lives? I think that it is facetious to say that\nit is a folk art so that we can all rest our minds about that, you know, that we don't have to be con-\ncerned about ... that we're clean; this is a folk art, it's ok. One can use contact lots of other ways -\nthe relative morality, the rightness or wrongness or whether it fits into your value system should be\nexamined.\nErnie: If you take something like contact ... and you can make it into where you're more sensitive to\nlife in general, the balances and flux of life in general, then it becomes evolutionary; but if you take\nit and it becomes another package, then that's what it is, another package.\nSome questions arc asked. concerns expressed and a dialogue begins. I hope the excerpts above may have\nprovoked thoughts in you and that you will share them with others. It is part of the dance. I hope that l have not\ndistorted too much the meaning of what people said by taking comments out of context or order. And in reading,\nplease realize the text above is in some sense my interpretation, my reflection, my recreation of what took place.\nYou had to be there. . . ·\n------fl------\nBYRON BROWN is one of the founding members of Mangrove and a member of the Bay Area Contact Coalition who\nsponsored Focus: 8/77.

Fostering a healthy interaction is the important concern.\nIn coming to a dance one must be ready to engage in a constant effort to focus on the physical\nsensations of weighted movement, balance and stillness. It is not the issue to identify through any\nconscious thought process what the sensations are; you need not know \"what physical sensations\nyou are experiencing,\" you must know how to focus with constant effort. It is. the strength and purity\nof this effort which will foster a healthy interaction in dancing with another.\nThe simplicity of the form Contact Improvisation is a gift. Its value is that it Is A Way for you and\nI to dance together. To befriend the forces of gravity and momentum is to dance with a sense of humor\nand constant humility, is to discover one's being self, is to discover true communion.\nThe essence of this dancing is the concentration and focus one brings as a dancer, it is only through\nthis constant effort that our dancing will continue to be.\nFour laws of ecology: \"(1) everything is connected to everything else;\n(2) everything must go somewhere;\n(3) nature knows best; and\n(4) there is no such thing as a free lunch.\"\nBarry Commoner in The Closing Circle,\nA.

    "Text": "By arranging and rebalancing our scrutiny and\nour relaxation of focus in our daily routine we\nfind ways to our appropriate redemptions. The\nconstant prayer that leads the pilgrim, Saint\nTherese's \"little way\", the yogi's systems of\nbreathing, and the mover's attention to the body\nas it washes, waits for the bus, cleans out the\ncatbox or ties a shoelace are among ways we\nfocus our being towards whatever unexpectable\nor hoped-for visionary experience waits grace-\nfully for us.\nVerbal languages and body languages both pre-\nsent regions of articulation, regions of common\nunderstanding, and regions of the unknown. By\nlooking at \"what we know\" we approach the fas-\ncinating places of \"the unknown\". Historically,\nContact Improvisation began with everything un-\nknown and in the recent handful of years, a body\nof knowledge, perhaps a grammar of words and\nmotions, has been evolving. We know we belong\nto the same tribe because we understand each\nother; we share a context.\nflexibility active bounce round robin\ncircle breath play partner\nattention gravity momentum pathways\nfloor honest dialogue wave\ntrust weight float stillness\nskeleton mood glide interfacing\ncontact rise skin center\n(This example is a random selection from lists of\n\"words related to Contact improvisation\" made\nduring a writing seminar led by Nancy Stark Smith\nin Seattle, January 1979.)\nBy now, hundreds and hundreds of people have\nhad some exposure to the form and its language,\nthrough classes, workshops, performances, re-\nviews, magazines, and photographs. People from\nall walks of life have attempted to describe, ana-\nlyze, teach Contact in terms of their own vocab-\nularies, which range from the scientifically\nspare to the wildly rhapsodic. Meeting changes\nand development within the practice of the form\nand colliding, assimilating, and crossing with\nwords from other contexts, the language of Con-\ntact Improvisation attempts to stay clear, direct,\nand as immediate as the movement itself.\nThe very obvious and the very subtle are al-\nways present in any utterance, pose, or figura-\ntion. Understanding the shapes and shades of\nmeaning and of momentum is as easy and as dif -\nficult as understanding music or the weather.\nEmbodying a concept may or may not use words\nbefore, during, and/ or after; when we seek\ndiscourse, the universe of words enters the pic-\nture. While a woman rolls in a wavelike motion\nacross the floor, another woman waves to her,\nwaving her hand. - (Homonym phenomenon.)\nDuring \"the stand\", a condition of vertical\nrest, in which the skeleton is balanced so the\nmuscles don't have to work to hold the body up,\nsmall adjustments and rebalancings were noted\nto go on involuntarily. When the accumulating\njiggles and twitches were seen to be a continuity,\nthere had to be something to call it, and it is\n\"the small dance\". This happened in the old days.\nAlso in the old days, so many experimental move-\nments were attempted that they were. given num-\nbers. These days the only one that is called by\nits number is \"the 58\". \"58\" is a vault pivoting\noff the partner's thighs, around hip-to-hip, rol-\nling over an arc across the partner's back, fi-\nnally rolling off into the air or someplace else.\nInflux and innovation occur in oi.tr lingo through\nborrowings like aikido rolls, t' ai chi stepping;\nforward rolls; from physics and metaphysics we\nadapt and adopt referent points like counterbal-\nance, chakra, yoga asanas, field .energies, ma.g-\nnetism. Innovative word-invention can produce\nterms immediately understandable, for example,\nSimone Forti's use of \"artsport\" soon swept the\nContact village and one feels again how perfect\na word it is coming upon the ungainly \"sportart\"\nin a newspaper clipping. Other terms like \"blotto\ndance\" never quite caught on. \"Finger ouija\"\nmay or may not be current.\nObviously Contact's language functions among\npractitioners-only groups, and in mixed groups\nwhich include non-contactors. In the former case,\nassumptions are frequently taken for granted,\nbased on common experience. Just as you can\ntell at once if your partner is really in kinetic\ndialogue with you, when verbal conversation flows\nthe words are subsidiary to the moment, suppor--\ntive of the meaning. In the case of the latter,\noften contactors find ourselves making wild anal-\nogies with rock-climbing or talus-running (which\nwe may not have done a whole lot of ourselves),\ntrying to clarify concepts without having to de-\nmonstrate at cocktails just what a 58 is. When\nwe are faced with a reporter, our mother, a\ndance teacher, a baseball fan, or a child who\nsees us doing it in the park, what words do we\ncall up? At the best of these moments the prin-\nciples that live within our process emerge mo-\nmentarily, and some of the phrases stay around.\nRepeating definitions, describing the same mo-\nment several times, feeding our words and ges-\ntures into the common experience keeps refining\nand redefining and refinding the same· old gravity\nand change.\n\n(Where two frames of reference cross, forming\nfour corners, linear transmissions fan out to-\nwards new forms in old formats, and variant con-\nditions, as \"from visceral to visual\", verbal to\nideogrammatic .)\nThe frame of reference of transmission at its\nclearest is in the actual movement when mind and\nbody play with each other.'retting go. Sometimes\nafter a duet we have no words because the exper-\nience was its own verb, its own noun. Art in\nteaching, healing, presentation relies upon arti-\nculation of the parts, knowing the anatomy, the\nsyntax. As we come to know the form we learn\nits languages, and we change and it changes and\nwe keep finding the known.and the unknown, like\nthe subtle and the obvious, in every gesture and\nutterance. It will stay like this and keep on going.\nWill you come for it? What are the wild waves\nsaying?\nQuestions for discussion.\n1. How can an axis function as an axiom, an\naxiom as an axis?\n2. Do you say: Do it this way OR This is how\nwe do it?\n3. Do you say: Let's have/make/do some\nContact Improvisation?\nL.. Do you ever hear or use words in Con~act\nImp situations which you don't understand?\nDo you ask what they mean?\n5. Do you ever stand under your partner?\n6.

    "Text": "The first CALIFORNIA HARBIN HOT SPRINGS CONTACT JAM was real good.\nI hod a nice time. A lot of people come from where /live-the Bay Area-but some from\nChico, one from Boulder and a few from other West Coast towns.\nBeing a newcomer to the contact community, I felt unfamiliar with what a jam\nwas supposed to be. You know, I hod read some earlier issues of CQ, taken a couple\nclasses from N. S. Smith at Wesleyan U., even did some Cl in NYC at PS122. But, going\naway for a long weekend with complete strangers to bathe in hot pools and dance didn't\nexactly make me feel at home, or at ease.\nWhat was the purpose of a jam, besides a reunion for those who hod already been\npracticing the form for awhile? I could tell there were some of us who were new to this\nkind of situation and didn't know precisely what was going on. This initial awkward\ntime reminded me of my first high school dance.\nAbout everyone agreed that music and dance should be present (but separate\nsome of the time) during the weekend. A lot of us, including myself, were interested in\nnot setting particular times for dancing and drumming or even bedtime. Someone re-\nmarked that the time might be felt organically.\nAt first, not a lot of time was spent collectively breathing or arriving. \"Plunging\nin\" is what seemed to be the desire of many. Maybe the hot springs pools provided the\nspringboard for this desire. I couldn't join the flow, though, because plunging in is a\nfear of mine. I needed to toke time to sit and think and tune into myself for what I\nwanted from this jam.\nWe were in a completely new world at Harbin, a rustic 7000 mile woodland,\nmountainous tree-lined areas volleying and rising oil around our enclosed dance shelter.\nA small brook ran by with clear water from the Napa Valley (wine country here in\nCalifornia). But with oil that beautiful natural environs, it was still troubling to me not\nknowing the jam boundaries. What were the rules of the game, as they soy? I sow possi-\nbilities in group sex, a homosexual and heterosexual couples' scene, raucous contact,\nsoft-eye dancing, rolling and breathing.\nAll this stuff I felt Friday night or so. Then, on Saturday morning, things opened\nup. Some of the senior members of the group taught half-hour mini-courses in Contoct-\nesque basics and new discoveries. I went up to the pools in the afternoon. It wosn 't so\nbod there. It was softer and quieter than in the dance shelter. Hazy and lazy, strong\nand light, mole and female, folks were just chatting and healing. Four of us novice con·\ntocters huddled our arms together in the pool and floated around like a spinning wheel.\nWe talked about what we sow Friday night. To my surprise, we shored a lot of common\nobservations. Then, we steamed in the hottest tub. We walked out ofter\\·ords, my\nbones felt heavy and my muscles suspended around my bones.\nOn Saturday night, .the jam got together in a circle to discuss the moi•ement of\nthe weekend. While people talked, someone tossed small coloriul ploybolls bock and\nforth in the circle. It looked like a game of marbles. You would toss a boll into the\ncenter and someone would try to knock yours out of the center and onto the periphery.\nThen, I forget who rolled herself into the center as a human marble. People giggled and\nrolled her around. Others joined her. That beautiful stock of 64 pillows by the \\·all\nbecome the next marbles, and a huge and monstrous pillow fight ensued. Finale: a dive\nbombing affair.\nPillow rumble, it was real good. A lot of heavy stuff. Straight, bold and big\nstrides over obstacles into the pile of tossed pillows. The rest of the weekend was fun.\nI think we, as a group of disparate individuals, discoi·ered our challenge: a common\nground. I think we also discovered a commitment: on organic message. To me, it was\non unfurling of the foll, a movement outward and down across the floor. As I spoke\nwith someone on Sunday afternoon on the trail bock from our lost dip in the pool, I\nfelt a return.\nAndrew Clibanoff",

    "Text": "About eighty five people came from\nEurope and the U.S. to take part in the\nFourth European Contact Teachers Con-\nference in Berlin, W. Germany from June\n8-13, 1988.\nAbout a year ago, the Tanzfabrik (literal-\nly, \"Dance Factory\") was asked to par-\nticipate in \"Werkstatt Tanz: Issues for the\nNineties\" as Berlin is the European City of\nCulture for 1988. DIETER HEITKAMP,\nBRUNO STEFANONI and BOB REASE col-\nlectively organized this conference with a\ntheme of 'New Influences and Crossovers'.\n\"Werkstatt Tanz: Issues for the Nineties\"\nwas organized around a theme of artistic ex-\nchange and some of the events of the con-\nference were open to the public.\nJune 8th and 9th were days for registration\nand open dancing as well as reunions with\nfriends, and acquainting oneself with parts\nof Berlin. Most people had arrived by the\nevening of Thursday 9th for an official\nwelcoming and introductions at the new\nstudio at Tanzfabrik. One studio had been\nput aside as a 'Video Cafe' and quiet room\nwhere, throughout the conference, videos\nof contact-related work were being shown\ninformally.\nFriday 10th June began with OPEN JAMS\nin three studios at the Tanzfabrik. On Friday\nafternoon, NANCY STARK SMITH and\nROBIN FELD led two separate\nWORKSHOPS-\"Developing the Form\"\nand \"Contact and Martial Dance.\"\nOn Saturday afternoon, ISHMAEL\nHOUSTON-JONES led a workshop on the\nPolitics of dancing, while PAULINE DE\nGROOT led one on improvised dance and\nmusic.\nOn Friday and Saturday evening after din-\nner, there were two PANEL DISCUSSIONS.\nThe topicfor Friday was 'Teaching' and Nan-\ncy Stark Smith moderated, assisted by Steve\nPaxton [see excerpts from this discussion in\nthis Newsletter]. People on the panel includ-\ned ROBIN FELD, BOB REASE, LOUISE\nRICHARDS, BRUNO STEFANONI, BERND\nKAMMERER, and GILA ROGERS. The\ndiscussion looked at questions in teaching\nsuch as the definition of a teacher, language\nand Contact, sexuality and aggression within\nsessions, and Contact in Therapy. Bernd\nspoke of his difficulties in the translation from\nEnglish into German, of the concepts and\npractice of Contact. He had learnt Contact\nin English and was teaching it in German.\nBernd was voicing an experience of teaching\nwhich must be common to all those teachers\nof Contact for whom English is not their first\nspoken language. It was added that it helps\nto use language which is part of the lives of\nthe people being taught, to teach concepts\nof Contact in ways which will make it ac-\ncessible for them.\nSteve Paxton said that his first concern\nwhen teaching Contact was how to teach it\nwithout people hurting themselves. Robin\nFeld described how she uses the breath to\nencourage the release· and flow of weight in\nher teaching. Using imagery such as melting,\nsoftening and folding at the joints all helps\nto encourage a safe physical environment for\ndoing Contact. Louise, who teaches Contact\nwith Kevin Finnan in high security prisons,\nsaid that changing from a dispersed to a\nfocussed activity can also prevent injury in\na session.\nThe question \"what are you teaching\nwhen you are teaching Contact?\" was link-\ned with finding a definition of a teacher.\nSTEVE BATTS spoke of sharing an investiga-\ntion with his students. He directs but may\nnot know the outcome of the activity. He\nbrought up the element of improvising in\nteaching, so that possibilities may be ex-\nplored by teacher and learner together.\n\"What about feeling and emotion in Con-\ntact?\" This brought up some important\nissues. Steve Paxton talked about how emo-\ntion may or may not be acknowledged in\ndance. He spoke of how Contact arose in\na dance context, within which people such\nas Martha Graham and Jose Limon were\ndealing with emotion, and making it into\nform. Paxton was drawn to Merce Cunn-\ningham, because Cunningham's dancing\nethic was more abstract and he dealt with\nshape, form, space and time-the physics of\ndancing. This was more intellectual and\nthere was less drama, less expression of emo-\ntions. In physics there is gravity, momentum,\nshape, angles and as physics is present in\ndancing, so are the emotions, \"but we don't\nknow how to deal with it, teach it, make it\ninto a form.\" This was difficult for Kevin Fin-\nnan who explained that he taught Contact\nto criminals who have killed children and\nadults, including their relations, and these\n'students' learn Contact and talk about it\nafterwards. I think there was some confusion\nhere between finding forms for emotional ex-\npression in daily life, and finding emotional\nforms for dance, although the distinction can\nsometimes be difficult. Contact in therapy\nwas an issue which was also discussed, and\nGila Rogers, a dancer who is also a\npsychotherapist, explained how she combin-\ned Developmental work with Contact in her\ntreatment of emotionally disturbed people\nand how effective Contact can be in her\nwork generally.\nOn the following evening, the topic for the\npanel discussion was 'Performing\nContact-Working with Personal Material'.\nSteve Paxton moderated, assisted by Nan-\ncy Stark Smith. The discussion began with\nan infqrmal jam for the panel who were\nPAULINE DE GROOT, LAURIE BOOTH,\nBOB REASE, DIETER HEITKAMP,\nISHMAEL HOUSTON-JONES, MARK TOM-\nPKINS and JAAP KLEVERING. When the\ndancing had subsided, some people found\nseats to sit on, while others continued im-\nprovising while the discussion took place.\nAfter about an hour, there was a break and\nthe panel rearranged their chairs closer to\nthe audience and remained seated. Steve\nbegan by asking each person on the panel\nto say a little about themselves, and their\nwork. He also asked them whether they had\ndanced in a Broadway show or musical,\nwhich had run for more than three nights,\nor if they had danced on a boat, and whether\nthey performed set material or improvised\nmaterial. I was occupied with taping the\ndiscussion and taking photos so my notes are\nscarce. However, I have down that Laurie\nBooth was interested in aberrant behaviour\nas movement in performance, describing\naberrant as marginalized or unusual activi-\nty. He recounted an incident which he was\nwitness to at the zoo that morning, where\na monkey had made history by imitating a\nfilm cameraman to the point where the\nmonkey was making a film of everybody\nlooking at him inside his cage. (I think this\nis what he meant, although the cameraman\nmay have given the monkey the equipment\nto make a film). Ishmael had never danced\nany set material, and Steve was alone in dan-\nc~ng in a sh~w which repeated itself for many\nnights running.\nJORGEN TELLER asked whether im-\nprovisation can become a collection of anec-\ndotes from learned forms. Steve replied, \"Be\ncareful of what you're taught, every step\nyou've ever learned is stored in the body,\nand pieces will emerge when you're least exJ\npecting it.\" There was a lot of discussion\naround defining the form of Contact Im-\nprovisation. A definitive statement of Steve's:\n\"Forms exist to follow, but you're less than\nhuman if you don't try to break them.\" This\npanel discussion began at 8pm and was go-\ning strong at 11 :30pm when I left. There\nwere tapes made of it which would hopefully\nbe obtainable at the Tanzfabrik.\nThe NETWORKING COMMUNITY\nMEETING began at lOam on Sunday mor-\nning, with sunshine streaming through the\nwindow of the studio. We decided that the\nnext European Contact Teacher's Con-\nference would take place from the 10th-17th\nAugust 1989 in Finland, and Jaap Klevering\nand Jaana Turunen would be organizing it.\nin Cyprus and Walter Weiler offered to\norganize one for Zurich, Switzerland.\nDieter Heitkamp was interested in com-\npiling a kind of journal to document\nresponses to and feelings about the con-\nference in Berlin. In the last part of the\nmeeting we all shared something of this with\nthe rest of the group. Here are some of the\nthings that were said:\nHow to begin dancing with strangers.\nWas this a conference or a symposium.\nThe founders of Contact dance don't know\nthe definition of it.\nThe conference was part of Issues for the\nNineties and we spent most of the time\ntalking about the '60s and '70s.\nAt no time did anyone say OK that's what\nContact is.\nTo make a group at this conference to talk\nabout personal, social and political issues\nsurrounding Contact dancing.\nThat a large group of people should learn\nhow to listen to each other.\nIt is a political act to go and see how the\nBerliners live instead of attending the\nconference-this is as important as be-\ning 'in the stars'.\nThere is no personal communication after\nsuch intimacy.\nTo create more opportunities for personal\nwork to develop.\nThe psychology of the outsider-a\ncelebration.\nTo sustain a network between conferences.\nWanting to have nothing to do with the 'hip-\npy, pseudo cult' which Contact could\nbecome and to keep Contact available\nfor all people.\nThe \"BERLIN JAM\" on Sunday afternoon\nwas an opportunity for open dancing among\npeople outside of the conference and those\nin it, and new energy and faces meant reviv-\ned dancing, for me anyway. It was a\nwelcome change from the highly structured\nevents of the conference, and reminded me\nof the two days open jamming before the\nconference began. I enjoyed the Sunday\nafternoon novelty of that jam and was glad\nof the opportunity to dance with new\npeople.\nThat night was the party, and Dieter\ntransformed the biggest studio with some\nspotlights and a sound system into a disco.\nOn Monday morning a group of us went\nto a cafe together. At the Contact Network-\ning meeting Mark Tompkins suggested that\npeople get together and talk about the per-\nsonal, social and political issues that they ex-\nperienced in dance and particularly Contact\ndance. It was a small group and there was\nthe chance to talk quite personally which\nwas a relief. The group was small enough for\nsome close personal communication to take\nplace and I feel that this is what the con-\nference, by virtue of its size, failed to pro-\nvide for, except in this group and outside of\nthe structured ti me.\nThe PERFORMANCE MARATHON was\nfrom 1 pm to 6pm that afternoon. This event\nwas open to the public and everyone paid\n15 marks toward it for the Berliner Aids Hilfe.\nIn the first half there were solos, duets and\none or two group pieces. This half was quite\norganized, in that there was a predetermin-\ned order to the pieces. There were im-\nprovisations and set pieces in this part of the\nmarathon, including new collaborations.\nAfter the break, the space was basically open\nexcept there was a structure which Pauline\nignored or forgotten as time w;nt by.\nWhen one of the musicians left, sound\nbecame the domain of the dancers who ac-\ncompanied themselves from around the\nspace or within it, talking and singing, or us-\ning tapes or playing the percussion in-\nstruments that were available. The space was\nnearly always pretty well full of activity and\nthere were one or two solos and at one point\nthere were about twenty people in the\nspace.\nThe marathon was the last organized event\nof the conference, although most people\nwould be attending the PERFORMANCES of\nSTEVE PAXTON and LISA NELSON, and\nLAURIE BOOTH that evening in another\npart of Berlin. But it was the end of the con-\nference at the Tanzfabrik and so those of us\nwho were there sat in a circle together for\ntwo minutes of silence to acknowledge an\nending with Dieter, Bob and Bruno.\nI would like to finish with some quotes by\nKERIAC from an article called \"Politics and\nContact\" in an old issue of CQ:\n. whv was this form named Contact Im-\nprovisation and not Steve Paxton Technique?\nIn the entire modem dance world, every new\napproach except Contact is based on a cult\nof personality: Graham technique, Cun-\nningham technique, Hawkins technique,\netc . .. to me, that name is revolutionary-it\nreflects a whole new value system in\ndance. . I understand that Paxton was a\nteacher at Bennington at the time he began\nexploring Contact, and that his co-workers\nwere mostly students. And yet, if two peo-\nple try to do Contact while maintaining the\ntypical student-teacher relationship, I think\nthose two wouldn't end up doing much Con-\ntact at all. Both the name and the form itself\nassume that Contact is a collective creation\nthat is bigger than individuals. There is a let-\nting go of ego, and a letting go of traditional\nrole expectations, that is unprecedented in\ndance.\n.. Contact began with the progressive, anti-\nelitist values of its inventors. But third and\nfourth generation contacters, who may have\nlittle or no contact with the originators, now\noutnumber the originators as teachers of the\nform. It's quite possible to teach someone\n'Contact' in the physical dimension only,\nwithout any conscious reference to values,\nor even in relation to values that conflict with\nthe form. To me, it's important for teachers\nof Contact to cultivate in themselves and in\ntheir students a heightened awareness of the\npolitical and spiritual richness of this form of\ndance.\n.. I think we in the Contact community\nhave a unique opportunity to foster the\nrevolutionary model that was generated by\nthe Contact originators. We can validate the\nactivities that do not conform to the tradi-\ntional expectations, because our own ex-\nperience in Contact has given us intimations\nof another type of 'good quality perfor-\nmance' . .. we can perceive performers as real\npeople in real time, making choices that have\nphysical results neither good nor bad, rather\nthan applauding 'stars' whose image would\nbe ruined by a 'mistake'.\"\n[from \"Politics and Contact,\" interview with\nKeriac by Mark Pritchard, San Francisco\n1979, CQ Vol. Vil no. 7.

    "Text": "This statement was submitted to\nthe Educational Policies Committee\nof Hampshire College, Amherst, Mass.\non November 29, 1979.\n\nContact improvisation is a move-\nment technique. Though much young-\ner than ballet or modern dance, it\nproves to be as rich and dee~. It ei_n-\nbodies a progression of physical skills\nwhich can be used to train the begin-\nner as well as challenge the virtuoso.\nStudents of contact improvisation\nacquire access to a large realm of\nmovement very quickly and begm to\nmake significant changes in their\nmovement patterns, strength, and sen-\nsitivity within three or four classes.\nThis makes the technique particularly\ndesirable for the theater student and\nnon-dancer.\n\nThe skills acquired in contact im-\nprovisation are by no means limited\nto the form itself. A deep understand-\ning of weight, movement flow, and use\nof strength greatly aid anybody who\ndesires to study ballet, modern dance,\nor other physical disciplines. The ex-\ntensive exposure to the physical and\nmental states involved in improvising\nand discovering movement can help\nchoreographers in their attempts to\ngather material for their set work.\n\nContact improvisation directly\nstrengthens one's presence. Just as\none can become aware of the eyes\nseeing, the ears hearing, and the skin\nfeeling, one can become aware of the\nmind sensing. Through practice of\nthis dance form one becomes able to\nexperience and observe the state of\none's nervous system particularly\nwhen in an intimate physical relation-\nship with another. This spawns an\nelement of control over one's percep-\ntual reality. This control and ability\nto focus is training in developing pow-\ner. Personal power and strength of\npresence is essential in any performing\nsituation as well as in daily life.\n\nContact improvisation nurtures a\nbasic physical trust between two\npeople and among a group. The form\ndemands a care and consideration of\none's partner and towards this end\nseeks to develop sensitivity and con-\nfidence. This trust and the freedom\nwhich ensues kindles a rich and fertile\nenvironment for working creatively\nwith another person. Knowledge and\nexperience of this environment aids\nin any situation where people are\nworking together, actors on stage\ndoing a scene, or dancers performing\na piece.\n\nThe working relationships which\ndevelop in this form cross the bound-\naries created by sexual roles; men\ndance with men, women with women,\nand men with women alike. I do not\nknow of anv artistic discipline in\nwhich non-~exual, deep, and honest\nphysical contact is explored with_ to-\ntal equality relative to sex. In this\nform women lift men as often as men\nlift women. Women learn to exercise\na kind of strength which often has\nnever been encouraged, likewise men\nlearn to allow themselves a soft, re-\nsponsive, and non-competitive posture.\nIt is a revelation to both partners that\na one hundred and eighty pound man\ncan be easily & completely supported\nby a one hundred pound woman.\nAgain, the trust derived from freeing\nthe traditional sexual roles creates a\nmore comfortable and fluid atmos-\nphere among any group of artists\nseeking to work together.\n\nContact improvisation seems to be\nof particular value for the college age\nperson. College students find them-\nselves in an intense period of transi-\ntion. They are coming to grips with\nthe image and reality of themselves\nas adults. Thev are intently exploring\nthe psychological politics of sexual\nrelationships. This form offers them\na grounded, simple, and clear oppor-\ntunity to interact deeply and honestly\nwith each other. It seems to serve as\na reference point or forum for expe-\nriencing oneself in relationship with\nothers in an unthreatening environ-\nment and without the need to formu-\nlate consciouslv or to talk about what\nis going on. The strongest evidence\nfor the emotional supportive value of\nthis work is the very real attraction\nstudents have for this form. They\nwant to experiment and expand. This\nform gives them the opportunity to\ngo ahead.",

The Contact Newsletter has moved on to become the\nContact Quarterly - a publication put out voluntarily by Free Association four times a year (seasonally).\nFree Association isn't an official name for those of us behind the Quarterly, but a term that catches the\nspirit of our collaboration. Our personnel shifts with each issue depending on (1) which coast is hosting the\nproduction, and (2) the availability and interest of local contacters for work on the production.\nOur common center is a working and experiential knowledge of Contact Improvisation. So far,\neveryone who has 'freely associated' on any of the Newsletter/Quarterly publications has had some exper-\nience with this new, now almost five-year-old, dance-movement-meditation-art-sport-event-piece. On that\nbasic ground we 'stand', and from that stand we swing out - into our overlapping worlds to collect material\nand enthusiasm to channel back through the center and out as far as it travels.

Two people inventing electricity within days of each\nother on opposite sides of the globe. Coincidence? Yes, Co-Incidence. And in a likewise but less dramatic\nmanner, we find more of each other every day.\nContact Improvisation has the unique quality of being believed - whether admired, respected,\nscorned, berated, inflated or ignored. Yes real time. Yes real bodies. Yes real people. This particular\ncredibility allows Contact Improvisation and those involved in it, to run tangent to many worlds - relating\ndeeply in to those worlds without either becoming distracted or dilute. In fact, the communication which we\ncontinue to develop among ourselves and articulate in our dancing serves us well outside our immediate\nnumbers. It is what creates our access to the unfamiliar faces, the rapidly surfacing and the as-yet unsurfaced\nnumbers of people who are working with the material of their lives in just such a direct manner as we attempt\nin our teaching, performing and writing of Contact Improvisation.\nWe 'stand' together at the ring of a watering hole; our weight brings the water up, our bodies,\nthe weight down.",

    "Text": "In the ancient fairy tales there is often a character walking in the woods where he meets a man (often named\nMercurius, one of the names of Hermes) who gives three gifts. These might include a bottle of wine that is never\nempty, or a cane that will open any door, or a cloth that will heal any illness. A gift that is often given is the cloak\nof invisibility. One of the images I often wear as I'm dancing is this cloak. I try not to interpret the image or figure\nout how it applies to my dance, I simply wear it, and the dance changes.\nIn teaching Contact Improvisation, I have found images to be invaluable for getting at the soul of our dance.\nIt is possible to give physical corrections and teach techniques but I have found that it is the imagery that brings\ndown mountains and sets the oceans ablaze. The images are sometimes descriptive and sometimes prescriptive.\nI will often flesh them out with a story or other images but they don't come with an explanation. Here is a list\nof images, some that I have used in my own dancing and some that I have given in my classes:\n- sleeping beauty after the kiss\n- the sand in an hourglass\n- sausages for bones\n- an empty scale\n- seeing through fish eyes\n-Atlas after putting down the world\n- think of yourself as a timeless piece of literature\n-hunter after big game deep in the jungle and the lions\nhave just come into view\n- bread rising and overflowing the bowl\n- resplendent robes, jewels and crown of a king\n- at the bottom of the exhale is when the lights go on\n- pancake batter spreading as it's poured\n- patina cracking and peeling off\n- greenhouse for winter blossoms in the chest\n- head and shoulders like a mop\n-you have no forehead\n- an old crone who has seen it all\n- the reverence, standing in a grand cathedral with\nsunlight streaming in\n- flowing skirt, longgggg hair, dangling earrings, dozen\nbracelets, emerald in bellybutton, tattoo of a rose on\nthe thigh\n- filled with cooking garbanzo beans\n- surprising thunder claps in the head\n- set up house at the bottom of the exhale\n- the view at the top of the inhale\n- spaghetti as it's dropped into boiling water\n-you have no arms or legs\n- jellyfish in the joints\n-the fall of the Roman Empire\n- tumbleweed\n- your spine is a pollywog (tadpole)\n- your ribs are fingers\n- pads of butter between each vertebra\n- bird bones that are lighter than feathers\n- a lover hand feeding you\n- granite mountain with crags and ledges and trees\ngrowing from rock\n- a leaf in the wind\n- mane of a lion whipping in the wind D",

I believe this work\nand other explorations compatible with Contact always involve the element of risk, whether we are\nrolling along air-born arcs or standing still.\nAs flow does not mean slow, receptivity needn't be measured by passivity.

Besides the basic sense of too much or not enough (alternately, I've been told by students\nhow there is excessive technical input or a frustration due to a casual and modest directive), we learn\nto use the word if it fits. Of course there is still much more to say.\nIn one of his first introductory classes, asking: \"ls the contact point the tension between trust and\nresponsibility?\" In agreement - yes, Danny, there seems to be many levels of lifting experience.\nDancing well with new students is the most advanced part of my learning.",

Contact\nhas been a catalyst in my relation to\nthe world, opening my dancing and\ngiving me a world to dance in.\nSince I was a small child I have\nsurfed on the urge to create little\nworlds of my own. I have been pro-\nducer and director, writer and per-\nformer, designer and clean-up crew\nover and over in order to dwell in\nthe magic reality of an altered, im-\nagined society. Contact, in its all-\nabsorbing concentration of attention\nand array of options, gave me hope\nand an example of physical/meta-\nphysical freedom. I hungered to ex-\npand the inward state of being in the\nflow of movement, turn it inside-out\nand make an arena of total\ninvolvement.\nIn 1982 I began going to jack-off\nparties. Lessons about weight and\n?u~render, momentum and timing,\nmt1macy and respect for the partner\nvital in Contact were also vital\namidst hot, horny men eager to play\ntogether. In both Contact and the\nj/o scene, trust, good humor and\nsensitive touch invite the interper-\nsonal rapport, and generate above\nand beyond the physical sharing an\natmosphere of generous welcome.\nUnwilling to be merely a partici-\npant, I felt my dictatorial drives\npush me to become an organizer of\nthe San Francisco JACKS in 1984\nand the next year I was one of th~\ncircle of radical artists who aimed to\nconquer the epidemic of FADS\n(Fear, Anger, Doubt and Sorrow) by\nbecoming the Healing Order of\nKthar Sissies. The party animal\nwithin me emerged as Dogtor Woof!\nSemiremide and I began to ad-\nministrate, mediate and realize\nclinics, parties, rituals and\nceremonies dedicated to healing of\nthe self and the planet. Dance had\nbecome movement, theatre had\nbecome paratheatre, my Contact\ngroup had become a support net-\nwork and dining club; as the '80s\nrolled along, religion, money, art\nand sex twisted and turned into\nsomething almost coherent,\nsomething like a big jewel lighting\nmy way.\nFor the last four years, my\nendeavors have included mixed\nevents for men and women, of gay,\nlesbian, bisexual, heterosexual, wild,\nshy, s/m and other persuasions\nwidening my outlook and expa~ding\nmy provincialism beyond the ex-\nclusively gay men's milieu.\nRecently I went to a Contact\nweekend where I discovered many\nfolks deeply embroiled in anxieties\nabout intimacy, attraction and other\npsychoerotic phenomena within the\ncontext of our movement form. At\nlast, I thought, my studies might\napply to the world of Contact, where\nI got so many good ideas in the first\nplace. Currently I am looking for\nways to offer some of the lore I\nhave won to contactors who once\nagain surround me. I am meditating\non drills, exercises, articulations of\nsome of the attraction/repulsions,\ncuriosities, fears and delights movers·\nreport that verge on and merge with\nthe psychoerotic. In private practice\nas a planet therapist, I use breath,\nmas~age, movement and counseling,\nseekmg to heal psychic wounds, as\nmany of us have been doing all\nalong, directly and indirectly. The\nduet of the skeleton and the breath\nonce my vision of the Contact dan~e,\nhas another dimension, crisscrossed\nand united with the duet of the per-\nsonality and the aura.\nAttractions to certain partners\nr~sistances that lead to challenge~,\ndifficulties leading to triumphs, the\ndarknesses required for stars to shine\nin: these are among my current con-\nsiderations. How these notions apply\nto Contact, how Contact applies to\nme and others, how by dancing our\nbest we can heal ourselves and the\nplanet: these are among my favorite\nthinks.\nFound in a spin, loving the spin\nI'm in, I remain your admiring stu-\ndent and pal, relaying radiant\nblessings!\nWoof! *",

      "Discussion with Martin Keogh and Kirk Andrews"
    ],
    "Text": "Andrews: The term 'shadow' has been\nused for thousands of years as a literary\nmetaphor for the dark side, the under-\nworld of life. Carl Jung, of Analytic\nPsychology fame, then picked it up and\nused it as a more poetic way to describe\ninformation that we repress and keep\ndown. There are a lot of things that we\nhave inside us that we don't show to the\noutside world. Jung said we have a\n\"persona\" character that we like to\nshow, and then a bunch of \"shadow\"\ncharacters which are kept hidden. The\nshadow is full of these characters. A lot\nof them are quite creative and power-\nful (i.e., the thief, the witch, the tyrant)\nbut we are taught that they are unac-\nceptable. When we work on integrating\nthe shadow characters, by talking about\nthem, and bringing them into conscious\nawareness, we release a lot of energy\nthat has been trapped there. The annoy-\ning thing is that just when we think we\nhave the shadow uncovered and figured\nout, it changes into another form. In-\nte grating the shadow therefore becomes\na lifelong process of looking within\nourselves.\nWe hope this discussion today will\nhelp us to bring out some of these\nshadow issues that are very real but also\nvery difficult to talk about.\nKeogh: One aspect is my pers~nal\nshadow in the dance: \"What am I bnng-\ning that I'm not wanting to look at?\"\nThen there is the shadow that is inherent\nin the form itself. I've noticed as we\nhave looked at some of this, that\nsometimes the material is offensive. The\nones I take offense at, the ones I get\ndefensive about, the ones where I say,\n\"No, that's not what Contact is about,''\nare the ones I need to look at most\ncarefully.\nWe want to start by shining a bright\nlight at Contact so the shadow can\nbecome nice and long and clear. Take\na moment to think of what you like best\nabout Contact, what brings you to the\nform?\nParticipants: • The incredible\nplayfulness of everybody• Trust•. Con-\nnection • Release • Cooperation •\nResonance• Total contact with some-\none • I feel like I get to be more fully\nme than in anything else I do • Because\nit helps bring out the shadow side of me\n• Confronting my fear and my sense of\nlimitation • Physical and emotional risk\n• Surprise • Touch • Freedom to push\n• The accepted intimacy • I love the sen-\nsuality • The vitality • Inspiration to be\ncreative in all of my life • Getting energy\nfrom non-energy• It's a metaphor for\nall my relationships • Spontaneity •\nAthleticism• Sportsmanship• Medita-\ntion • Recognition •\nKeogh: These statements demonstrate\nwhy we love this form. Because we. l?ve\nit we think it's healthy to turn a cntical\ne;e towards the form and our participa-\ntion in it. One way that Kirk and I have\nbeen working on this is to look at what\nwe like then delve into what's behind\nthat. If.I like how playful everybody is,\ndoes that suggest we have a group of\npeople who refuse to grow up? If this\nidea bothers you, you might be near the\nshadow. Today, let that be a guide.\nHere are five questions to work with\nin your small groups:\n• What do I deny or repress to do this\nform?\n• What do I like too much about this\nform?\n• What do I experience in this form that\nI don't like to acknowledge?\n•What's missing for me in this form?\n•What's missing in the Contact\ncommunity?\n(The group splits into eight small groups\nwho talk with different levels of anima-\ntion. We get back together.)\nKeogh: We would like to hear a few\nstatements from each group. The rest of\nus will try to hold back the impulse to\nmake it all better, or say you're wrong,\nor you're ok, or that's not my ex-\nperience. We will just try to hear it.\nGroup one: We talked about two main\ncategories. One was sexuality and the\nother, community. There is a blurred\ndistinction between sensuality and\neroticism, and the lines often blur in the\ndance. . . One person said that\nsometimes women he'd be dancing with\nspoke about feeling aggressive sexuali-\nty from their male partners, and they\ndidn't know how to deal with it, and\nusually would excuse themselves to go\nget water.\nParticipant: Uh oh, you blew thefr cover\nnow.\nGroup one: With community, the in-\ndividual often judging what the com-\nmunity wanted from them. It came back\nto not knowing who you are yourself,\nchanging how you act to fit the\ncommunity.\nGroup two: Honesty vs. niceness, how\ndo you let someone know you dislike\nthem and don't want to dance with\nthem. Is it better to be honest and just\ntell them so, or be nice ... Culture came\nup. A lot of us seem to be from the same\nbackground ... Everyone in our group\nis involved in academic institutions, and\nreally get into our heads, is this a haven\nfor our bodies to express themselves?\nGroup three: What do I experience that\nI don't like to acknowledge?: fear of\nphysical danger, of rejection and\nvulnerability. How do I judge who I\ndance with or don't dance with and how\ndo I tell them? Men holding back their\nweight from women ... What's missing\nfor me in this form?: The completeness\nof the intimacy. This sense that it is ok\nto be intimate within certain parameters\nbut it doesn't extend even to sometimes\nsaying goodbye to someone after class.\nOne of the most frustrating parts of this\nform is describing it to people who don't\nknow it. A definition! ... What do I like\ntoo much about this form?: Again, in-\ntimacy, sensuality, letting go of the\nmind, just sort of checking out or\no.d.ing on the experience, not knowing\nwhen to stop just because 'it's there' ...\nWhat do I deny to do this form?: fear\nof physical danger. Sexuality: the fear\nof being exposed, fear of rejection, of\nnot looking good, the judgement that\nI don't know how to do it. The judge-\nment that I am not trained enough to\ndo it. .. What's lacking in the com-\nmunity?: a lack of professionalism, in\npresentations and facilities.\nGroup four: We talked about feeling\nvulnerable about approaching people\nand feeling insecurity around skill\nlevels ... Someone had discomfort dan-\ncing with the opposite sex, and had a\ndesire to know them better to feel more\ntrust before dancing with them ... The\ndifficulty of making eye contact while\ndancing, which seems paradoxical in\nsuch an intimate situation ... Someone\nwas disturbed by the lack of blacks and\nminority groups.\nGroup five: Somebody asked does\nanybody feel grief or other strong emo-\ntions while doing Contact? We had all\nhad some intense experience, either\nremembering something from our\nchildhood, or something that made us\nwant to cry. . . We talked about how\ndifficult it is to do Contact and be in a\nrelationship. Both with a partner who\ndoes Contact or one who doesn't. How\ndo you communicate to your partner\nthat this is only Contact, we're not\nhaving sex here ... We also talked about\nhow the community is very\nhomogeneous. We are mostly white,\nwell educated, and lacking ethnic\ncultures and people with handicaps.\nGroup six: We talked about talking too\nmuch about emotions and the kind of\nphilosophical baggage that comes with\nthe form. Why do we have these kinds\nof discussions? Both perspectives of it\nbeing baggage and opportunity. . . We\ntalked about fears of intimacy, liking\nparts of the form too much, so it goes\ninto a dangerous area, such as liking be-\ning touched too much, and then becom-\ning dependent on it. We talked about\ndreams.\nGroup seven: We talked about snob-\nbisms in the community. That fashion\nawareness is very repressed ... and some\nliked too much the availability of attrac-\ntive women. (lots of varied reactions)\nGroup eight: Injuries; people feeling\nthey are put aside and not talked about\neven though they very much affect the\nform ... We also talked about the com-\nmunity as a whole not having a defined\nsense of what Contact is, and letting it\ndevelop and grow out of that, it's a\n\"free for all\" kind of deal.\nParticipant: Contact also has a\nsmugness about it, vis a vis the modern\ndance community. It's a mutual thing,\nwe often say modern dance is very\nmechanical, and something is missing in\nit. And about Contact, their's is a\nthread about a lack of discipline, a lack\nof professionalism, focus, we take\nrefuge in our own spontaneity and struc-\nturelessness and our unwillingness to\nwork with crafting things.\nAndrews: Any time you put out that\nyou are better than someone else, one\nhas to wonder if the shadow part is say-\ning, \"We feel less than ... \"\nKeogh: Kirk and I have come up with\nsome statements, or \"judgements\"\nabout Contact that we hope will bring\nsome of the shadow out into the light.\nSome are more serious than others. We\nwould like to put these out, and then we\ncan make the impossible jump of try-\ning to at least resolve our talk today.\nAfter we came up with this list we split\nthem into four categories:\n•Power •\n•The Form\n• Gender & Sexuality\n• Personal (a catchall for those that\nare hard to categorize)\nWe decided not to put these down as\nquestions but as statements. We will\nstart with the Power category:\n•We are always in a supportive role\nwith one another, seldom in a conflict\nrole. There's very little conflict in this\ncommunity.\nParticipant: ... little that gets express-\ned anyway. (laughter)\nKeogh: • We are all big fish in a little\npond and there are no predators.\nBecause the form is about support and\nflowing and acknowledging, the form\nattracts people who aren't very\npowerful.\n• We are people with a complete lack\nof boundaries.\n• There is no overt competition, there\nare no levels of attainment, no accolades\nto be reached. So you can do this form\nforever and never get any acknowledge-\nment for it.\n• We are a group who tends to have a\nfailure streak. (heated reaction)\nParticipant: Is there any group that\ndoesn't?\nKeogh: Remember, we don't have to de-\nfend the form right now.\n• No one in our community is outstan-\nding or excels in their own field. (more\nheated reaction)\nParticipant: What are these????\nKeogh: These are statements.\nParticipant: That someone else made,\nthat you made, that you believe, that\nsomeone believes???\nKeogh: These are possible shadow\nstatements. Some of them we came up\nwith looking at what is good about Con-\ntact, some are our own speculation,\nsome we heard from others, and some\nare from people looking at the form\nfrom the outside.\nParticipant: Ahhhhh! That explains it!\n(laughter)\nAndrews: These are generalizations.\nParticipant: I have a difficult time with\nsome.\nAndrews: That may be a sign that they\nare in your shadow, we usually don't\nlike, and are critical of, what we hold\nin the shadow.\nParticipant: I want you to take respon-\nsibility as the person who reads these\nstatements. It's like someone else is try-\ning to define who I am, and I resent\nthat. I ask that the person reading these\nput them in an \"I\" form.\nAndrews: That's a good thing to say but\nour answer is no. I hear what you want\nand we talked a lot about how to do\nthis.\nKeogh: We decided that because the\nform is so supportive and \"I\" based and\nnonconfrontive that we would simply\nput these out as statements.\nAndrews: They include us, but I can't\ntake responsibility for them all because\nI don't believe them all. This is to fuel\nthe discussion. We are not saying, this\nis how you are, or how the form is, but\nthese are possibilities of our shadow in\nthis form. If these statements don't\napply to you, just let them go by with\na laugh. If they draw a reaction from\nyou,_ it is worth reflecting on your reac-\ntion. That is a part of our purpose.\nKeogh: Under the category of The\nForm:\n• There is no connection in this form\nbetween discipline and art. It makes no\nartistic statement.\n• There's a hierarchy based on who gets\nthe highest rides, who shows off the\nbest.\n• It is a form for latent gays and\nperverts.\n• We suffer from naive idealism, with\nideas of egalitarianism and \"organic\nprocess.\"\nAndrews: In the Gender and Sexuality\ncategory:\n• We're getting off on breaking the\nincest taboo. We get to have a kind of\nsexual experience with lots and lots of\npeople who are more family than lovers.\n• Men are better at Contact than\nwomen. (oohs and laughter)\n• It fosters an androgynous sexuality.\nIt turns men into women and women\ninto men.\nKeogh: Look at our apparel.\nAndrews: • The emotional and the sex-\nual get cut off to do this dance.\nUnder the Personal category:\n• One thing I don't like to acknowledge\nis that I'm good at this form. My brag-\ngart has been kept in shadow.\n• Contacters are slaves to their sensa-\ntions and feelings. If we gave as much\nweight to our ideas, we would be called\nfanatics. (whew/ no, no/ again!)\n• Contacters are slaves to their sensa-\ntions and feelings. If we gave as much\nweight to our ideas, we would be called\nfanatics. And possibly would be much\nmore powerful in the world with that\nforce behind our convictions and beliefs\nrather than our physical bodies.\n• We are trying to fill the hole where we\ndon't feel loved.\n• We are all leftovers from, or resent\nhaving missed, the '60s and the\ntouchy/feely/group-gropes. (moan)\n• This issue of everyone being so playful\nand not wanting to grow up. The Peter\nPan syndrome.\nParticipants: Hallelujah! I Let's just\nchange the definition of growing up I\nsome of this stuff doesn't sound like\nshadow but conscious choices.\nAndrews: Like we said, there's a lot of\ncreativity and pow:r in the shadow.\nParticipant: Whenever we talk about\nsexuality /intimacy, getting into our\nbodies, we take on the morality we grew\nup with, rather than celebrating this\nthing that brings up our feelings of in-\ntimacy, that nurtures us, that fills the\ngaps, the holes where we feel unloved.\nI feel when we talk about this, it's as if\nwe are getting off on something we\nshouldn't. I'd like to see more of a sense\nof celebration over these things.\nAndrews: That is true, and, for right\nnow we are here to dig up the muck\nmore than to celebrate.\nParticipant: I like that. I'm not saying\nwe shouldn't be digging. I just wanted\nto say that the terms sexuality and sen-\nsuality always get lumped into the\nmuck.\nParticipant: We have to dig them up to\ncelebrate them.\nParticipant: I see the focus on two\nforms of shadow. There's our own in-\nternal blockages, that may get in the\nway of the dance (or help the dance).\nAnd then there is this cultural stuff that\nwe grew up with. IN essence, we are\nhere to turn that stuff upside down and\nexplore the side of it we never got to see\nthe first 20 or 30 or 40 years of our lives.\nThe culture is driven by fanaticism on\na certain level, the fanaticism of\ndominating the world and repressing\nour feelings about that. Here we are tur-\nning it upside down: it's not our place\nto be powerful out in the world in a\ndriving way. We can't challenge what's\nout there with the same behavior as that\nwhich we are challenging. So, it's very\nappropriate, at this stage in the evolu-\ntion of the form and the community to\nbe very introspective and visible.\nKeogh: I feel we're trying to elevate this\nmaterial. I don't think we are ready to\ndo that. We haven't been down in the\nshadow long enough yet.\nParticipant: I noticed my emotional\nresponses to some of these statements.\nSome went right by and others got stuck\nin me. Like hearing an old judgement\nI used to have about myself from the\nculture. Boy, there was a lot of reaction\nhappening among us in response to\nmany of these. I would encourage\neverybody to look at the ones you had\nthe most inner discomfort with and ask\nwhat's happening here. Clearly there's\na lack of resolution around a lot of these\nissues. I appreciate the statements be-\ning read the way they were because they\nwere spoken the way my internal judge\nspeaks them.\nAndrews: One of the benefits of look-\ning at the shadow is you get a lot of\nenergy back. If we are powerless, the\npower is in the shadow, if we are\nplayful, the adult is in the shadow, if we\nare shy and afraid, the confident one is\nin the shadow. It makes it worthwhile\nto go there. Secondly, I think it's im-\nportant for our community to look at\nthe shadow and look at what's missing\nin order to be a real community and not\na pseudo community that's superficial.\nCall it community maintenance. We\ncan't say, \"Oh, we talked about that\nlast year,\" and then let it go. We have\nto keep working with it. One of the\nthings that I want to acknowledge is that\nour community does a good job of talk-\ning about issues. That has been especial-\nly true at some of the Harbin jams.\nHopefully today will have raised up\nsome questions that we can continue to\nwork with. This is an ongoing process,\nseek out a friend if you need to talk with\nsomeone. We need to close for now.\nKeogh: Before we get active, let's sit\nquietly for a moment and review what\nthis discussion has evoked. *\nSpecial thanks to Dawn Weiss and Dan\nMatson for transcribing the tapes of this\nevent.",

    "Text": "1. In 1974, after seeing a visiting\ndance company during my senior\nyear in high school, I sign up for\nmodern dance P.E. as a freshman in\ncollege. Astonished that I had made\nsuch an effeminate choice, my\nparents make me switch to\nbasketball-which, since I'm only\n5 '4\", I hate.\n2. Three years later, a fellow\nwriter on the college newspaper in-\nvites me to a performance by\nDeborah Hay, who has just moved\nto Austin. \"She's kind of a hippie,\nbut you may like it anyway,\" my\nfriend predicts. I hate the first half\nof the show, and then love the se-\ncond. A few months later, I take the\nfirst dance classes of my life with\nHay. One of the core members of\nthe Judson Dance group, Hay's\nclasses during the late '70s are run\nwith a kind of New Age anti-elitist\nphilosophy, in which everybody is\nallowed to think they can dance.\nFortunately this includes me.\n3. During the next two years, I\nlearn a philosophy of movement and\nperformance from Hay. At the same\nstudio in Austin, I also take modern\ndance and contact improvisation. I\nget a crush on every one of my\nteachers. I even become brave\nenough to take modern dance at\nother studios. After two years, I'm\nin the best physical shape of my life.\nMore important, the realm of dance\nhas been opened to me. Best of all I\nlove contact improvisation; learning\nhow to do it is like relearning a\nlanguage I had once spoken and then\nforgotten.\n4. After a terrific summer, the\ncore group of contacters that began\nin my class slowly fades away until\nI'm literally the only one left who\nwants to do contact anymore.\nFrustrated with this and other\nevidence that Austin is full of space-\nouts who don't really want to do\nanything, I move to San Francisco.\nIt's 1979.\n5. One of the reasons I moved to\nSan Francisco is that I knew I could\ndo contact improvisation here.\nMangrove, the most successful of CI\ngroups, is at the peak of its career,\nand there are several other active\ngroups. As soon as I get to San\nFrancisco, I head up to Vancouver\nIsland to take part in a two-week\nlong jam. I'm excited to think that\nat last I'll be among people who like\ndoing contact as much as I do, in-\ncluding all of Mangrove and most of\nCl's biggest luminaries from across\nthe continent.\n6. Unfortunately, these stars seem\nmostly interested in dancing with\neach other rather than with nobodies\nlike me. I'm not the only person\nwho feels this way; three days into\nthe event, there is a general discus-\nsion about elitism. The CI stars pro-\ntest that they don't have to dance\nwith anybody they don't want to.\n7. Intimidated by Mangrove's\nself-preservation stance and feeling\ninsecure, I link up with the only\ndancer at the event who's really\nfriendly to me, a contact teacher\nfrom San Francisco named Keriac.\nWhen I get back to the city, I join\nher group, Walkabout Dance\nCollective.\n8. Walkabout had been formed a\ncouple of years before by en-\nthusiastic participants at a big CI\nconference of some kind in Berkeley.\nAs a new nobody in town, I'm\ngrateful for how they welcome me\nand the skills I learned in Texas.\nThree months after I arrive, I do my\nown performance, in which some of\nWalkabout's members participate, a\nmixture of poetry, film, music and\ndance. It's a fair success.\n9. I also start attending contact\nclasses taught by Alan Ptashek, who\nhad been one of the only people will-\ning to show me a few things at the\nevent on Vancouver Island, and I go\nto all the CI jams. There are a lot of\nfriendly, enthusiastic people to dance\nwith, and I'm really glad I came to\nSan Francisco.\n10. But there are some currents\nthat I don't understand, even in this\nnon-elitist group. During rehearsals\nfor my piece at Walkabout, it\nbecame clear that there was a\nmisunderstanding about whether the\nperformance was going to be a col-\nlective process or mainly my crea-\ntion. Ten days after the show, I visit\none of the performers. At first she\ntactfully criticizes my creative pro-\ncess, but then gets angrier and\nangrier when it seems I don't under-\nstand. After a long tirade, in which\nshe calls me sexist-which deeply\ndisturbs me, since in Texas I seemed\nto be one of the most feminist men\naround-she throws me out of her\napartment.\n11. In November, seven months\nafter I arrived in San Francisco, I do\nmy second performance, in which\nthe main piece is a long apology for\nall the things I've been criticized\nabout, like being macho, walking too\nheavily, not melting sincerely\nenough, and not trusting my feel-\nings. Afterwards, the woman who\nthrew me out of her apartment\ncomes up to me and says, \"Mark,\nMark, I loved your piece.\"\n12. I like Walkabout because we\nhave our own studio, and a\ntwice-monthly performance series, so\nI get plenty of chances to do my\nown work and interact with others in\nthe community. Even better, we all\nsupport each other on our projects,\neven if we privately realize it's not\nvery good art. It's great to be ac-\ncepted and to belong to a real\ncreative group.\n13. In addition to my involvement\nwith Walkabout, I help produce the\nBay Area Contact Network (BACN)\nnewsletter, and I take it upon myself\nto show up on time at every single\nSunday jam in Golden Gate Park, in\ncase someone new comes on time\n(everyone else is always late). I go to\nperformances by Mangrove and\nother groups. I conscientiously\ndevelop my skills in Alan's class and\nin workshops taught by visitors like\nAndrew Harwood. I collaborate with\nothers on several shows. I get fired\nfrom a job for reproducing the pro-\ngram for a show on the office\ncopier.\n14. Eventually, through sheer ef-\nfort if not dance ability, I begin to\nbelong. I stop being a nobody and\nbecome one of the people closer to\nthe center of the CI community. I'm\nalways ready to do the door at my\nfriends' shows; I produce a couple of\nlarge contact improvisation concerts,\none to benefit CQ, the other for\nabortion rights. I do my own pieces\nat Walkabout shows every two or\nthree months. The peak of this\nperiod is mid-1981.\n15. All during this time, however,\nas I practice contact improvisation\nfor performance and as a pure move-\nment form, I'm utterly bored by the\naspects of CI that have to do with\nhealth, chiropractic, \"healing,\"\nvarious New Age therapeutic\n\"techniques,\" and mysticism. A title\nof a typical article in CQ at this\ntime, when it seemed that the only\nway to salvation was to become as\nhealthy and \"natural\" as possible,\nwas \"Can the Body Ransom Us?\"\n[by Maxine Sheets Johnstone, CQ\nVol IV:3 I 4; Summer 79].\n16. In reaction to all this, I write an\narticle entitled \"New Age Shuf-\nfleboard,\" in which I warn that an\nemphasis by contacters on all this\n\"healing\" will lead CI away from\nart and performance and into some\npost-hippie suburb of the soul. My\narticle is published in the BACN\nnewsletter and reprinted in CQ [Vol\nVI:l, Fall 80]. Some people like it,\nalthough they don't agree with me.\nThe number of people who are will-\ning to approach CI as a performing\nmedium rather than as therapy, and\nto collaborate with me on CI pro-\njects, gets fewer. I start to feel like a\nlone voice crying in the wilderness.\n17. By mid-1981, the people of\nWalkabout and I have gone about as\nfar as we can go together; I've\nstarted doing theater and music and\nthey aren't really the people I want\nin my pieces anymore. I leave the\ngroup and start another CI group\ncalled Tangent Dance Collective with\nsome friends from jams. We do a\none-night \"tour\" to a small town\n100 miles away, and plan a trip to\nSanta Fe, NM. One week before the\nSanta Fe trip, the other male in the\ngroup decides that it wouldn't be the\nbest thing for his process. We cancel\nthe trip and the group breaks up.\n18. The moves I like to do most in\nCI involve jumps and carrying. Me\nand some other males start practicing\nthese at a jam one evening. Flying\nthrough the air and throwing each\nother around, we're having a terrific\ntime. Then some women start teasing\nus, singing \"Macho, macho men\"\nafter a currently popular disco song.\n\"Mark, the jumping is fun, but you\nshould really learn to melt more,''\none of them tells me later. \"Get in\ntouch with your receptive side.\"\nAround the same time, a contact im-\nprovisation teacher tells me\nmysteriously, \"You need to realize\nyour beginner's mind more.\" I don't\nhave the slightest idea what he's talk-\ning about.\n19. At some point in 1982, the at-\ntendance at jams really starts to fall\noff. The jams in the park fade away\nand eventually it seems that no one\nexcept me is interested in doing CI\nas performance, although you can\nsee CI from time to time in\nchoreography by some local modern\ndancers. The BACN newsletter stops\npublishing. Mangrove breaks up into\ntwo competing groups. Meanwhile\nmy performances start to contain\nmuch less dance and much more\ntheater and music. There are fewer\nand fewer CI events to go to, and\nmy attention is taken by my writing\nand theater projects.\n20. I still believe in CI that has an\nartistic emphasis. I write a couple of\narticles for CQ, but they're rejected.\nI organize a symposium of con-\ntacters, with a panel made up mostly\nof people who were the bigwigs when\nI arrived in town 5 years before. We\ntalk about what we think the future\nof contact improvisation is. There is\nno consensus, not even towards\ntherapy. In fact, everybody sounds\nreally depressed about the future of\nContact. This is the last CI event I\ncontribute to. Although there are\nstill a few classes going on, the Con-\ntact scene that was booming when I\narrived in town seems dead.\n21. In early 1983, while the roof\nof Walkabout's building is being\nrepaired by a landlord whom we\nsuspect wants all the artists out\nanyway, there is a huge\nthunderstorm. Water destroys the\ndance floor at Walkabout's studio,\nand the collective seems ready to\ndisappear. I feel glad to have gotten\nout when I did. Meanwhile, my non-\ndance performing is going strong. I\nalso go back to school and become a\nhigh school English teacher.\n22. By 1986, I've spent several\nyears doing only theater and music.\nWith two dancers who know nothing\nabout CI, I form a group called\nShort on Attitude, which is dedicated\nto doing dance and performance art.\nI choreograph a wildly energetic\ndance piece that has almost no con-\ntact improvisation. There's nobody\naround to tell me I have to melt or\nbe natural, or do things according to\na party line, but I am learning about\nmelting in another realm. I get in-\nvolved in s-m and learn, in a sub-\nmissive role, what being receptive\nreally means.\n23. I go to Japan and teach\nEnglish for 2 years in a stultifying\nprovincial city.\n24. When I return to San Fran-\ncisco in late 1988, I attend a sort of\nWalkabout reunion. It seems they\nsued the landlord for the ruined\ndance floor and won a settlement;\nwe go out to an expensive dinner\nwith part of the money. It's fun to\ncatch up on what people are doing\nthese days. One of the people at the\ndinner used to be a big wheel in the\nCI community. I ask him what he's\ndoing these days. \"Holding safe sex\norgies,\" he replies. I get his phone\nnumber.\n25. Keriac, whom I also see at this\ndinner for the first time in years, has\nbecome successful teaching contact\nimprovisation in Europe. She makes\nenough there in six months to live in\nSan Francisco for the other six\nmonths.\n26. I resume doing pieces with\nShort on Attitude. Meanwhile, a\ngroup called Contraband, made up\nof people who are artistic descen-\ndants of Mangrove, is becoming\nwell-known using CI, along with\nother kinds of postmodern dance, in\nchoreography. Another rising com-\npany called the High Risk Group\ndoes the same. In fact, although\nthere are no performances anywhere\nof plain contact improvisation, you\nsee scraps of CI in almost every\nmodem dance performance and even\nin rock videos.\n27. Short on Attitude sponsors a\nlow-tech performance series. To my\nsurprise, a group of contacters signs\nup to do a piece, and I eagerly put\nthem on the bill. When they per-\nform, they make all the worst\nmistakes that I made, and learned\nnot to do, ten years before. I feel\ndisgusted, as if all the lessons we had\nlearned in the early '80s, all the pro-\ngress we tried to make, had been in\nvain.\n28. I later learn, from an ex-\nWalkabout member, that CI is in-\ndeed making a comeback, especially\nin Berkeley. There are lots of classes\nand well-attended jams. Hearing this,\nI don't want to go at all. I feel I\ngave Contact the best of my energy,\nenthusiasm and support, back in the\ndays when I was young and impres-\nsionable, and that all my efforts\nwere wasted because my priorities\nwere different from other people's.\nIf I went back now, I'd probably get\nripped off again. Also I'm older and\nfatter and wouldn't dance well. It's\nnot worth it.\nMoral: Contact Improvisation,\nwhen I discovered it, held a great\npromise. It let me do things with my\nbody I never thought I could; it\ntaught me valuable lessons in sexual\nand social dynamics. But by insisting\nthat contacters follow a party line on\nthe relation of contact to health and\nspirituality, and by neglecting\nesthetic issues, the CI community\nalienated me (and who knows how\nmany others?). If it's true that there\nis a new upsurge of interest these\ndays, I would like to urge the CI\ncommunity not to do this again.\nDon't spurn the priorities and in-\nterests of new converts who love\ncontact improvisation and have a vi-\nsion of what it could be. It's too late\nfor me, but it's not too late for you.\n*\nEx-contactor MARK PRITCHARD is a\nwriter, performance artist, and publisher\nof \"Frighten The Horses,\" a magazine\nabout the sexu_al revolution.",

    "Text": "The California Contact Im-\nprovisation Jam at Harbin Hot\nSprings continues to be an amazing,\ndelightful, challenging, evolving\nphenomenon. The first one was held\nin the Fall of 1986. We're now\nworking on the eighth Jam, which\nwill be the end of May, 1990. The\norganizers are: Julie Oak, Penny\nPaulus, David Russell, Robin Tren-\nda, and myself. On occasion, due to\nuncontrollable circumstances or by\nchoice, an individual organizer has\ntaken a Jam \"off.\" For the past\nyear, Robin has discontinued his role\nas an organizer, because of the vast\ncommitment he has made to\nestablishing and directing the new\nWall Street Center for the Arts in\nChico, CA.\nIn the Spring of '86, the 5 of us,\nplus several other Bay Area Contac-\ntors were at the Breitenbush Jam [in\nOregon]. Robin proposed a meeting\nfor exploratory talks for anyone in-\nterested in starting a California jam.\nDuring the week we must have had 4\nor 5 meetings and the groundwork\nwas laid. We went home, fresh from\nthe excitement of Breitenbush, made\nphone calls, decided on Harbin as\nthe site (mostly because of the\nspacious Conference Center, the\nmineral hot tubs and pools, and its\n2Vi hour proximity to the Bay Area),\nfound a caterer, chose a date and the\nball was rolling. We had a solid ex-\nample from Breitenbush to draw\nupon, and our own personal ex-\nperiences there helped shape our\nideas about how we wanted our jam\nto be. Thanks to Alito Alessi and\nKaren Nelson for creating the event\nthat inspired us.\nWe had the advantage of having a\nlarge regional Contact Community as\na base, but still we decided to\nminimize our risk and start small.\nThe first one was from Friday night\n., to Sunday night, and was truly one\n§1 of the most joyous and exhilarating\nc3 weekends of my life. Everyone seem-\ned to feel that way. It was like giv-\ning birth, except that the labor had\nseemed so easy! We decided not to\nwait a whole year to do it again. The\n2nd Jam was about 6 months later,\n©\n0 in May '87, and was expanded to 3\n] days and nights.\nc.. We've been doing them twice a\nyear ever since, one in the Fall (late\nOctober, early November) and one in\n~ the Spring (late April, early May).\n!:'-- The 1990 schedule, however, has\n·g, been changed drastically. The Con-\n..: ference Center we use at Harbin\nc (where we have a beautiful large,\niJ airy room, bathrooms, showers, a\n~ small \"guru\" room, and hot & cool\n15 pools all to ourselves) is in high de-\n0' mand, and this year is not available\ntf at our usual dates. Also, for years\n;; people have been wanting a longer\nE jam, and there is an ever-expanding\n~ list of folks who want to come. We\nc. always have a waiting list, though\n·5 we've increased our maximum from\nv B 40 to 55. So, we decided to try\ngf' something different. This year we're\ni having THREE Jams-all occurring\nover holiday weekends [see Notice in\n\"CQ Newsletter\"]. We will resume\nour \"regular\" Spring/Fall schedule\nin '91.\nWhat has been the effect of all\nthese Jams? Besides being a tremen-\ndous source of enjoyment and op-\nportunity for exploration and\ndevelopment of our Contact, there\nhas been much bonding and inspira-\ntion for other Contact activities. The\n\"Community\" I speak of has grown\ndramatically during these last four\nyears. It is still diverse, and not\neveryone involved with Contact\ncomes to the Jams. But a strong,\nvibrant and more organized group\ncontinues to spawn, expand, create\nand develop. The annual Contact\nFestival emerged from an initial vi-\nsion and discussion at one Harbin\nJam, spearheaded by Andrew\nClibanoff, who now lives on the East\nCoast. The Contact Teachers Net-\nwork has taken shape-we now\ncooperatively list all our classes,\nworkshops, jams and performances\ntogether on one joint flyer. There\nwas an energetic effort to create a\nContact Community Center. Many\npeople devoted much time and\nenergy to this endeavor. Because of\nthe lengthy process we were pre-\nempted in getting the studio we had\nhoped to rent. For now, the 8th\nStreet Studio serves as our Berkeley\nhub. There have been various perfor-\nmance groups and series, as well as\nContact camping trips and picnics.\nA 40-minute edited videotape titled\n\"Thank You For This Dance,\" has\nbeen created by videographer/film-\nmaker Brandy Brawner and me. It\ncontains footage shot at the '87 and\n'88 Harbin Jams. Copies are\navailable from me for $25 [see 'Con-\ntacts' for address].\nAlthough the majority of Harbin\nJ ammers do come from the Bay\nArea, many have come from\nthroughout the West Coast, notably\nSeattle, Portland and San Diego.\nWe strive to set up an environment\nwhere everyone feels welcomed, in-\ncluded; and that each person's feel-\nings, ideas and feedback are impor-\ntant. We have daily group \"sits\"\nand meetings (though we prefer to\ncall them \"gatherings\"). We have a\n\"dream pool\" where people put out\ntheir dreams and fantasies for things\nthey would like to have happen at\nthat Jam. There are group scores\nand presentations. A memorable one,\ninitiated by Darshana [Ellis] from\nSan Diego, involved nude women\nand paint. After much heated debate\nabout whether, where and when it\nwas going to happen, it turned out\nto be an exquisite dance ritual per-\nformed outside shortly before the\nSunday closing. Last Fall, Keriac\nand others constructed a thoughtful\nscore which we all participated in,\nprocessing our many deep and mixed\nfeelings following the Earthquake\n(\"The Pretty Big One\") which we\nhad just survived 1 Vi weeks before.\nThere is careful attention given to\ngroup process and how Jam policies\nand decisions are made. Participants'\nwritten feedback at the end of each\nJam has proven invaluable. As\norganizers, we have developed our\nskills as facilitators-a role which\nhas proven to be both challenging\nand rewarding.\nAnd of course there's lots of Con-\ntact. Dancing, jamming, classes,\nmore jamming. But I think what\nmakes the experience so rich is that\nrather than being an isolated 2-hour\nepisode of Contact (like at a weekly\njam) it goes on 24 hours a day for 3\nor 4 days. We live it and breathe it\ntogether, as a group. We eat\ntogether, sleep together (accommoda-\ntions are either camping or com-\nmunal in the conference center), hot\ntub together, hike, dance, talk, play,\ndrum, argue, sing, cry, laugh, hug,\netc. It feels so natural. I always feel\nsomehow more fully \"me\" at these\nJams than at practically any other\ntime. And I always feel so grateful\nfor this form which has so im-\nmeasurably enriched my life; and for\nthe opportunity to serve, grow with,\nand be part of this special Communi-\nty, which I know extends beyond the\nBay Area, beyond California,\nbeyond the U.S., even beyond\nEurope and into at least parts of the\nrest of the world. *",

    "Text": "Empathy, an elusive word,\nmeans ... dancing in another person's\nskin? If empathy is the ultimate\nform of love, then dancing contact\nimprovisation, too, is a form of\nlove.\nThis idea took on new meaning\nfor me in Eugene, Oregon at the\n1991 DanceAbility workshop.\nDisability is not monolithic.\nCerebral Palsy is not the same as\nMultiple Sclerosis is not the same as\nParalysis due to nerve damage is not\nthe same as Blindness. Even within\nthe \"category\" of cerebral palsy,\none person can communicate by\nspeech, another by pointing at pic-\nture symbols, yet another spells\nwords by looking through a clear\nplastic plate covered with the\nalphabet while a \"reader\" speaks the\nwords the \"speaker's\" eye\nmovements have indicated. Each per-\nson is affected by their disability in a\nsingular way, yet they are routinely\nlumped together as people \"who\ncan't get along without help\" in our\n(able-bodied) world. Instead, each\nhas struck a different balance with\nthe physical world, making\nthemselves differently-abled.\nGerry Overington, who is totally\nblind, told me that I might close my\neyes but would still not enter the\nworld he lives in since my \"mind's\neye\" would still see the scene. He\ndoes not live in a picture that's been\ntemporarily obscured. For him the\nbalance of his senses has shifted\ntoward attention to touch, sound,\nsmell, and memory.\nBruce Curtis lost the use of his\nlegs, and hands partially, to his\nspinal cord injury at 17. Since then,\nhis wheelchair has become an exten-\nsion of his body. (He's definitely not\n\"confined\" by it.) If I say, \"Wheels\nhave replaced his legs and feet,\" that\nseems obvious yet far too simple.\nRather, his body has become dif-\nferently shaped because it integrates\nhis chair with his flesh and bones so\nthat his movement is an ever-varying\ncombination of the capabilities of\nboth.\nIn dancing with Bruce, I was the\none learning to move. I couldn't res-\npond in habitual ways-weight and\nbalance were different. For instance,\n\"taking weight\" in an able-bodied\nduet often involves supporting the\nother's weight through spine, legs,\nand feet. However, in one duet with\nBruce, I felt \"taking weight\" as a\nbalancing in which our arms were\nlike the spokes of a wheel transmit-\nting weight back and forth between\nme as the hub, and him as the rim,\nour weights alternately stretched\naway then compressed towards each\nother. Bruce might lean/ extend into\nme in such a way that my weight,\nanchored through the floor, would\nprovide a resistant center which he\ncould alternately push off from or be\npulled in by, creating a momentum\nand continuous change of direction\nthat rolled his chair around me.\nGravity seemed to act horizontally as\nhe pivoted around me. No hands\nwere required to turn the wheels of\nhis chair, the spiraling thrust created\nwas the almost effortless product of\nthe lateral interplay of our weights.\n(The image of planets orbiting each\nother comes to mind.) Seen from the\noutside, one might think that the\nable-bodied person was always in-\nitiating, but Bruce said his partner's\nactive weight supported him by pro-\nviding a resistance he could work off\nof, amplifying his initial impulses so\nthat his range of movement was ex-\ntended. In fact, our dance was\nunrestrained by his chair whether he\nwas moving in it or carrying the duet\nout of it to the floor.\nEmery Blackwell cannot walk or\nfeed himself. When I helped him at\nthe Breitenbush Jam my hands were\nmomentarily his: when they fed him,\nwhile brushing his teeth, while clean-\ning up after being on the\ntoilet. .. standing or sitting was a\ngame of balance and support with\nme or some well-anchored object.\nYet he bicycles 30-60 miles a day,\nalone. He talks of his dance of get-\nting into and out of the bathtub,\ndancing his way out of bed, into the\nbathroom. He has a joy in moving\nthat I realize I've long given up to\nthe habitual shorthand of getting\nfrom here to there in the world. He\nalso dances for audiences-solo, and\nin a remarkable partnership with\nAlito Alessi, continually dancing\nthrough what I'd imagined to be his\nlimits. He bought ballet shoes for\nfeet which, although they will not\nsupport his weight, have been\npoetically aligned by his cerebral\npalsy into a permanent en pointe\nposition. He is a truly graceful,\nwhole human.\nDancing in EMPATHY, what does\nit mean? Bruce told me a story, say-\ning, \"Suppose I drop a coin on the\nground. Now, it usually takes me\nlonger to pick it up than an\nable-bodied person and it's curious\nto see if someone will pick it up\nbefore I do. There is a certain\namount of time which society allots\nto a given task and if I take longer\nthan that I am seen to be having a\nproblem.\" He's not. Long ago he\naccepted his own frame of reference.\nTime has become very personal. He's\nnot having any trouble but able-bod-\nied people often don't see that. Their\ndiscomfort sets in when, \"it takes\nhim too long\" and sympathetically,\nsometimes with pity, the coin is pick-\ned up so that he doesn't have to\n\"work so hard at it.\" Bruce said he\ndoes appreciate help, but it almost\nalways comes with that attendant in-\nsistence on the able-bodied frame of\nreference. Sometimes that means he's\nbeen judged, subconsciously or not,\nto be less than competent.\nPerhaps he's seen to be in physical\npain? For a short while I was captive\nof those feelings, even when I knew\nthey had no basis in fact. In my\ncase, the pain and fear associated\nwith old, and temporarily-very-disab-\nling skiing injuries were being dredg-\ned up, leading to momentary irra-\ntionalities like, \"He is in pain, and\nunhappy. It's temporary, he'll\nheal ... \" Or, sometimes emotions\ncan link disabilities with aging and\ndying (I've had a close friend and\nparent die recently) and so sadness\nand grief, as well as fears around the\nloss of physical functioning, can in-\nappropriately become attached to\ndisabled people. It's awkward when\nthe experience of the different-\nly-abled is felt through an able-bod-\nied filter, but it's not surprising. We\nspend so much time and attention\ndancing around our own discomfort.\nSo to dance in empathy is to\ndance in the frame of reference of\none's differently-abled partner, mov-\ning on equal terms ... which is true\nof contact improvisation in general\nbut now one stretches into new ter-\nritory (as Chinese or Arabic are a\nmuch greater stretch for our English\nears and tongues than German or\nSpanish).\nSometimes the contact of the im-\nprovisation is other than touch.\nOther times conflicting touch im-\npulses are felt. Emery told me that\nan able-bodied person bends an arm\nby signalling muscles to contract\nwhile simultaneously suppressing\nthose signals to muscles opposing\nthat movement, but the area of his\nbrain which controls the \"suppres-\nsion\" function has been damaged by\ncerebral palsy so both bending and\nstraightening muscles contract at the\nsame time. It's a standoff that he\ncan overcome by conscious thought\nbut there's often a \"lag time\" of 30\nseconds or more which, even then, is\naccompanied by the jerkiness of con-\nflicting muscle messages. In dancing\nwith him, I found I had a tendency\nto arbitrarily choose to follow one\nimpulse or, conversely, none. Either\nway, I was stuck in my own perspec-\ntive, doing my own dance, drowning\nout Emery's initiatives. Waiting with\nEmery meant operating in his time,\nlistening for his intention to sift\nthrough his nervous system, allowing\nmy senses to shift into line with his\nwithout losing my own center. Danc-\ning with that lack of knowing was\ndifferently-dancing, since for those\ndances I was living as if all muscle\nmovements required conscious in-\ntervention. I felt the awkwardness\nlike a never-ending struggle to\njuggle.\nRarely have I been so conscious of\nthe body as the container of the\nspirit. But then that's the content of\nthese dances: the movement of the\nhuman spirit transcending the con-\ntainer it's been given by birth or\nchance. In contact improvisation,\nboth movers are extending through\nlimits, not the least of which are the\nlimits of empathy ... going into\nanother world and allowing another\ninto one's own. Enabling each other\nto dance with those risks. *",

That\nimplies that everyone out there who\nisn't experiencing it is probably suf-\nfering. That doesn't sound quite\nlogical. But surely it has spread\nbecause it answered a collective need,\nquenched a collective thirst.\nI have tasted my own milk and it\nis sweet. I cannot remember, but I\nimagine, that as a breast-sucking\nnewborn, I enjoyed nursing not only\nfor the sweet sustenance it poured in-\nto me like sunshine, but equally for\nthe contact improvisation. We could\ncall it our first conversational part-\nner, speaking and listening through\nthe skin of mouth, hands, arms, face\nand chest, to a partner who is warm,\nresponsive, fluid, round and featur-\ning a special point of access.

(In\nTibetan teachings, the solar principle\nis feminine-the power to ripen and\nsustain life-and the lunar principle\nis masculine.

I am not advocating a\n\"topless\" society, though I see\nnothing wrong with that concept, so\nlong as it is left up to each in-\ndividual to decide. But I believe in\ndoing the obvious, ·or at least\nrecognizing it, and it is obvious that\nthe human body is a long way yet\nfrom being liberated. Especially the\nbody of the mother, once worship-\nped, now persecuted through taboos,\nharsh birth practices, a medical\nestablishment that discourages nurs-\ning, and ignores the fact that skin-to-\nskin contact with the baby is the key\nto its well-being and development.\nIn accepting the Nobel Prize, and\nagain in addressing the Italian\nGovernment this spring, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama of Tibet reminded\nhis audience that every member of\nthe human race is born free of\nreligion or culture, but shares univer-\nsally with all human babies the need\nfor affection. Physical contact with\nthe mother is the single most impor-\ntant factor in the well-being of the\nnewborn for the first weeks of life,\nhe said. It reaffirmed my feeling that\nthis is the topic of the hour. If we\nallow the generation being born now\nto grow up with their need for con-\ntact satisfied instead of scorned, the\nproblems of the world may be in-\nherited by sane and compassionate\npeople who have the natural ability\nto do the obvious.\nI wonder how the contact com-\nmunity can assist in the process of\nrestoring to childhood the possibility\nof communicating with parents or\nothers through touch-a language\nalready functioning at birth, years\nbefore speech is perfected. Perhaps\nthe goal of Contact Improvisation\nshould be to render itself obsolete.\nMy hope is to stimulate dialogue\nin \"Still Moving\" regarding the\nlanguage of touch between parent\nand infant.

    "Text": "alternate being \"the mountain,\" \nsometimes very quickly ... creating a\ntrail, mimicking snowy terrain: over\nbumps, sudden drop-offs, twisting\nsharply, skittering over ice, floating\nin deep powder snow. The Contact\npoint is the \"fall-line,\" the shortest\npath down the mountain according\nto gravity but by no means the\nshortest distance. The mountain sup-\nports the skier like thermal air cur-\nrents do the soaring bird. Skiing is a\ncontrolled fall. Gravity provides\nmomentum. Muscles are used like\nthose of birds, to guide rather than\npropel, continually shifting the body\ninto elastic equilibrium between the\nlifting push of air and pull of gravi-\nty. Sometimes the mountain drops\naway so sharply it's all the skier can\ndo to react quickly and forcefully\nenough to keep up with radically\nfluxing terrain. Sometimes the slope\nis so gentle that a wide arcing turn\nrequires delicate balance over edges\nof skis that engrave a single curved\nline in the snow.\nDanger is clearly present, especial-\nly the faster you move ... because\nthings come at you faster. Or maybe\nit's not \"things,\" maybe it's that\nspace around you changes shape\nfaster than you can cope with that\nchange which prompts a survival in-\nstinct that car crash survivors\ndescribe as a near-death experience. I\nknow I survived a few 70 mph\ndownhill race crashes (no broken\nbones, no sprains even!) that I\nwouldn't have if time hadn't\nsomehow stretched out, become\nelastic, enough to allow me to move\nin ways that saved me from serious\ninjury. What happens \"in the blink\nof the eye\" to the outside observer is\n\"more than enough time\" to the\nperson inside the event. I'd name it\ncatastrophic awareness.\nSuch an uncanny state of being,\nyet it can also exist outside of the\ntrauma of impending injury. I found\nthat out during a downhill race that\nhas remained tatooed on my psyche,\na continual reminder of what's possi-\nble while moving. On that run, I\nknew that I had \"more than enough\ntime\" to do whatever was necessary,\nsometimes waiting as impatiently as\nfor an overdue bus lumbering, too\nslowly, closer. Yet, at 50-75 mph,\nmy skis flapped like banana peels, a\nclear indicator that a lot of ground\nwas being covered fast. \"More than\nenough time to be ready\" was not\nlike film seen slo-motion. At race\nspeed, the landscape zips by as a\nblur of shadowy shapes and bright\nedges. It's very abstract. There's a\nstrong tendency to \"hang back,\" \ntrying to \"hang on\" each moment in\norder to sort and bag it in the cor-\nrect category of past experiences,\nwhich only leaves awareness \"hung\nup\" like a mail bag at the station as\nthe train hurtles by. With one's\npsyche \"stuck,\" stiff fear tries to\nguide the body and a truly dangerous\nsituation arises. Yet during that par-\nticular downhill race each moment\nwas seen/sensed sharply ... no blurr-\ning, like extraordinarily fast film\nshot at an unheard of shutter speed.\nSo many \"sense photos\" felt and let\ngo of with such quick clarity that it\nwas easy to deal with each moment\ncompletely. Confusion and panic\nwere out of the question, so the\nmoving had a calm easy quickness.\nMy body seemed so much expand-\ned that I could touch snow twenty\nyards downhill. The feeling was one\nof being \"present\" in a lot more\nspace than the physical body oc-\ncupied, and time had to stretch\naround it like a balloon being in-\nflated. \"How much time does it take\nto get from here to there?\" makes\nlittle sense when there's no separa-\ntion between here and there ... so the\nfarther the \"reach,\" the more space\nencompassed by the moment. Maybe\nthat accounts for my sense of \"more\nthan enough time.\"\nDancing Contact Improvisation\nwas the first time, off snow, I've\nbeen able to approach that peculiar\nstate of awareness. Certainly it has\nto do with unpredictability, especially\nsince Contact lmprov involves \"two\nmountains that think.\" The ease, or\nlack of it, in dealing with the\nunknown has to do, in ski racer\njargon, with the quality of \"being\nunweighted, or floating.\" Oddly,\nContact lmprov jargon describes that\nsense as \"giving your weight,\" yet\nthere's no contradiction. Neither\nmeans weight as measured by a\nscale, but rather an equalizing of\npressure, skier against mountain,\nbody to body. No matter the words,\nthe phrases imply a resilience in\nresponse to the occurrence of an un-\nforeseen possibility.\nOn the level of muscle tissue, I\nthink of resilience much like Steve\nPaxton's description of \"snap-\nrelease\" (the ability of muscle fiber\nto change states, tensed vs. untensed,\nquickly). A released muscle is long\nand untensed; a relaxed muscle short\nand untensed. The released muscle\ncontracts and an arm, leg, torso lifts,\ntwists . . . The relaxed muscle con-\ntracts to resist compression, or lock\nthe bones in a structure. Relaxed\nmuscles allow gravity and momen-\ntum to open joints with no work.\nReleased muscles shorten without\nresistance. Just a few basic syllables\nin the language of muscle tissue\nmake for novel choices of body\nmovement. A zillion bits (like the O's\nand 1 's of computer thought) of\nresponse taken as a whole reveal the\nlimits and shape of the dance.\nAnd so the body is ready to\nchange shape suddenly, in unex-\npected ways. When a mogul (snow\nbump) presses upward sharply, the\nbody has to compress quickly, absor-\nbing the shape of the mountain, then\nunfold as the mogul drops away, in\norder to equalize the pressure of skis\nagainst snow. Resilience allows any\nchoice of many how/when/where's\nto be executed with an easy\nquickness. However, to the un-\nresilient skier a mogul is a synonym\nfor catapult and the one choice left\nis survival in a wild ride down the\nmountain.\nThere are patterns that make the\nterrain feel familiar, yet every run is\nsingular, even if its the fiftieth down\nthat trail. Resilience seems to have to\ndo with paying acute attention to\nidiosyncratic inconsistencies with past\nexperience and'using that awareness\nas the impetus to act, rather than in\naccord with \"what you know is go-\ning to happen.\" Even in a slalom\ncourse where the \"gates\" dictate a\ntightly structured path, there are an\ninfinite number of lines through it.\nSimilarly, my most wonderful\nContact lmprov dances have revealed\nthat what might become routine or\nhabitual can be familiar and unique\nall at once. Each dance seems to\ncreate a new, big, human psyche.\nBodies link like bones, gravity the\nmuscle tissue connecting them, ben-\nding and twisting this larger body. It\nfalls apart, it falls together ... as it\nsteps and \"catches\" its momentum\non a common foot. *",

There are two sectors this question affects: the contactor5,\nand the public; that is, students, prospective students, or views of contact - the public image as\nit were, by which to some degree Contact Improvisation is defined.\nContact is not a finished thing. Changes in its methodology and its result are expected.\nHowever, the definition it has achieved has been a consistent one, giving a useful continuity to those\nnew performers who wish to communicate, especially on paper, what they are doing in concerts\nand classes. For the students of Contact (of whom there have been many hundreds at this writing)\nit seems only fair to either follow procedures designed to aid them in dancing with community of\ncontactors at large, or to indicate in titles and descriptions of classes (as Mangrove has done) the\nbridge between Contact Improvisation and new attitudes stemming from Contact, that are actually\nquite different in practice. The delicacy comes here: How wide is the definition of Contact to be,\nand is Contact well used by this extrapolation? An extreme position relative to the established core\nof Contact Improvisation should probably be given another name or reserved for advanced contactors\nto whom the references would be clear.\nThis is a century of extrapolation. It is not coincidental that industrial revolution, the\nmodern arts, the increased pace of communication and travel have all occurred this past 100 years.\nChange of attitude, environment, ideas, reality, happen far more easily now and the problem is\nthis, change is cheap. Definition has become difficult to establish or to maintain.\nThe artist has a duty/right to manipulate the techniques which contribute to their art.\nThere are however, responsibilities to these techniques to keep them clear of confusion. For those\ndancers already familiar with Contact techniques, it may be that outside the Contact framework more\nimprovisational adventure may be found. Should it, however, be called Contact?

    "Text": "Images. Spent time with Mary Fulkerson, teaching and taking classes. Several of our number\n[contacters] have studied with Mary, and she has spent time in Contact, though she prefers\nher own work as a basis from which to teach. However, the continuing juxtaposition of her\nAnatomical Release work and Contact has provoked a headful of thought; her students in Eng-\nland and those from Rochester, N.Y. take to Contact with remarkable ease compared to other\ngroups in the U.S.\nThis ease of assimilation is of interest. While the students are lying down, crawling, walking or\nrunning, Mary Fulkerson speaks ritually, encouraging greater sensitivity to alignment and efficient\npatterns in the body. The manner of presentation tends to by-pass the though~ of the listener.\nThe listener is preoccupied with moving or relaxing at the time, and the ritualization has a lulling\neffect, soothing in tone and timing. The images she provides are simplified anatomical 'cartoons'\nof functioning anatomy as opposed to intellectual or visual anatomy. These images describe .sen-\nsations - their location in the body and possible directions in which they might move.\nThe students then assimilate material directly from their own sensations, culled from releasing\nunnecessary tension, work, strain.\nMary Fulkerson finds a rare balance of authority and humility which gives fundamental weight\nto her voice without usurping the motivation of the student and avoiding their rebellion or\nfascination. Nor does her voice question the integrity of the sensations unique to each student.\nTheir confidence in the process gathers momentum with the growth of awareness of the functional\nanatomy, and soon, non-anatomical images can be simply physicalized. Earlier in the process\nhowever, before these channels become clear, an illogical image would more likely provoke bewild-\nerment, scorn, or intellectual interest, than movement.\nThe parallel is with the Contact 'stand': The mind of the listener is encouraged to become a\nreceiving instrument. Fulkerson's images further provide guidance to sensations which improve\nfunction. The stand in Contact isused to remove the habitual masking of the forces-that-be by\nrelaxing the listener into states of mind where time, gravity, mass and inertia are apparent, where\nbalance is seen as subtle movement, and social expectations in partnering can be dropped; it is\npossible to talk directly to the body~ and for the listener to listen directly with the body. Each\nperson can hone and direct real physical sensations into their own most direct & efficient dance.\nAs Mary Fulkerson is currently presenting her work at Dartingtim College (Devon, England) it\nis used as a first step providing the student with a map into private anatomical sensations and\nimprovements. Great care has been given to the anatomical propriety of the images, because\nin this work, the idea each person's mind holds of their body is seen as crucial to the awareness\neach develops.\nBeyond Mary Fulkerson's work there is a question for the student at Dartington. What to do\nwith the vocabulary they have sensed and the improvements they find in their use of the body?\nMany possibilities exist, and one path, that of Contact, seems quite compatible; moving from\nthe interior of one's functioning anatomy, to functioning with another. I hope in the coming\nyears more of us have an opportunity to sample this connection.",

This is done with the\nspiral initiated either at the top with the hands and arms,\nor with the toes, feet, and legs at the bottom.\nIn these spiral rolls, a single initiation of energy flows\ninto the most extreme spiral the body can achieve and\nthe roll continues as long as the shape is maintained. The\nmovement stems from changes of weight inside the body\nas different surfaces of the spirals are rolled upon.\nThe less extreme alternating helixes of walking also\npermit movement initiation from different places in the\nbody, but in practice just a few such options are\nintegrated into an habitual walk.

(\"There are no lines,\nonly edges.\" Ansel Adams) Only a few years after its inception,\nContact seemed to be spawning generations of contacters so\nquickly as to be involved in some kind of 'telephone game'.\nJohn tells Sally who shows Sue who passes it on to her brother\nwho tells his wife who shows their kids who bring it to school\nthe next day for recess. If John were walking by the schoolyard\nat noon, would he recognize anything familiar going on in the\nplayground? For all the interest in defining Contact Improv-\nisation, the answer to that quandary is in watching a contact duet\nbetween two dancers who have just met. The definition is in\nthe doing.\nContact bases its language on the natural laws that govern\nmotion (gravity, momentum, inertia, etc.). With these laws as\nour constitution, we have no need for legislation. The natural\nworld enforces its own laws - drop a book, consciously or not,\nand it wil I fall. Clearly, Contact Improvisation is not the begin-\nning or the final stage in the opus that relates the body and its\nmovements to the earth and the other movers on it. The truths\nwe find in Contact, whether basic or elevated, are truths that\nexist with or without Contact Improvisation as a means for re-\nvealing them to us. Often in the enthusiasm of the work it is\npossible to forget that bodies moving in contact are not new.\nIt is, however, the continued focus on the elements involved in\nthat contact, techniques for it, applications of it, that is specific\nto Contact Improvisation.\nMaking a magazine (CQ) for the exchange of information\nand viewpoint instead of making a congress, allowed the various\nsubtexts that existed to emerge and be shared. As a technique\nfor moving together, Contact resonates in the lives of the prac-\ntitioners. Those resonances are personal and varied, and though\nthey enrich the work, the basic practice seems unchanged.\nAfter 6 years, Contact Improvisation continues, with\nor without music, in twos, threes, in groups with a name or with-\nout. Contacters have gathered in bodies, regional families, to\ncorroborate and continue. A context has developed similar to\nsocial dancing wherein people can come together and 'jam'.\nTiirnugh Contact Quarterly a network exists, making known\nplaces where Contact can be found.

They move\nfreely through suggestions of various\nimages ... readily becoming the \"butterfly,\"\n\"cloud,\" or \"tiger\" that is suggested.\nThroughout my twenty years of teaching\nexperience with young children, I have\nemployed improvisation as a method to\nenhance the children's modes of expres-\nsion. Although they occasionally made\ncontact with another student (partner)\nduring the course of an exercise, it often\nseemed uncomfortable, or took on the\nappearance of social dance styles. The\nmovement then became more contrived\nand less free.\nFive years ago, I began to introduce\ncontact improvisation to the children. We\nbegan gradually with very specific rules.\nWhat evolved were some very elaborate\nand interesting shapes, which we dubbed\n\"Pretzel\" dances. The children loved the\nprocedure as well as the results. We\nhave continued to evolve these dances\nover the years by adding and eliminating\nthe rules of design.\nIn the most basic form, a group of\nyoungsters takes independent space on\nthe floor. They must be close enough to\nthe other students to touch them. Upon\nhearing certain musical cues, i.e., the\nbeat of a drum, they must contact a\nneighbor with any one part of their body.\nUpon hearing the second cue, they make\ncontact with another child or the original\nchild using a differen' part of their body.\nThis method continues until the children\nare entwined in an elaborate design.\nThe design usually breaks apart with a\nfinal musical cue (i.e., the ping of a trian-\ngle), and then the group is ready to begin\na new design. Very often when I watch\ntheir pieces evolve, it seems that I am\nviewing them through a giant kaleido-\nscope.\nRecently we attempted a new version\nof our contact \"game.\" I decided to ex-\nplore the use of a basic notation method.\nA pattern might be written like this:\nSTART: 1, 2, 3, ... 1, 4, 3, ... 2, 0, 2, END.\nThese numbers indicated how many\nparts of their bodies should make contact\nwith another dancer or dancers. By\nwriting this series of numbers on the wall,\nthe children viewed them as they moved.\nThe contacts flowed more smoothly, and\nthe transitions occurred at the individual\npace of each child. They no longer only\nmade contact at the specific beat of a\ndrum. The results were less entangled\nand intertwined, but far more interesting\nand sophisticated.\nThe final step of these contact projects\nat this point, has been to add our own\nmusic. Using simple percussion instru-\nments, the children take turns being the\nmusicians and the dancers.\nAlthough there seems to be a rigid\nformality to the method, it appears to\nhave captured even the most reluctant\nand inhibited of the children to participate\nin the creation of joyful and creative\ndesign.*",

    "Text": "Peter is big and burly and in his\nfifties. He has virtually no sight. having\nbeen badly injured in a traffic accident\nHis sight loss was instantaneous and\nirreversible. He could no longer work\nat his trade; he no longer had an income\nand he felt very depressed He came to\nthe contact improvisation workshop with\nsome trepidation-he was not \"artsy\ncraftsy\" and thought dancers were a\npeculiar and probably effeminate breed\nHowever, he thought he would give it a\nchance as a friend of his had spoken\nvery warmly about the workshop.\nHaving been athletic and interested in\nsports when he was sighted, he experi-\nenced no difficulty with the work. Over\nthe five days, he began to enjoy himself,\ngiving and receiving massage and learn-\ning to build up the skills that are basic\nto contact improvisation.\nTowards the end of the workshop\nPeter was asked to contribute to some\nvideo-based research. At the start of the\nworkshop, blind participants had been\nrecorded walking the length of a gymna-\nsium, finding a chair, sitting on it. and\nrising from it They were asked to go\nthrough the same exercise at the end of\nthe workshop; thus we are able to re-\ncord objective changes in posture and\ngait\nPeter had in fact missed the initial\nsession as he had joined the workshop\nlate. He is a very humorous man, and\nrealising the reasons behind the exercise\nhe treated us to his version of a \"bad\nwalk\" as he put it What he gave was a\nhilarious Chaplinesque performance of\nthe exercise: holding his cane ahead of\nhim, he stumbled his way forward\nthrough the vast dark territory of the\nunseen gym, the blind cane then became\na fencing sword and he fought his way\nthrough a duel with an imaginary foe.\nVictorious, his stick transformed into a\nhorse which he sat astride and whipped\ninto a gallop to the far end of the gym.\nTurning, he lurched drunkenly back\ntowards the chair which he could not\nsee but sensed the position of. Having\nreached it. he failed to sit on it. somer-\nsaulting his way through falls; and ulti-\nmately, threading his cane through the\nback of the chair and hoisting i~ aloft\nover his shoulders, he trudged off into\nthe proverbial sunset. Peter had found\nimprovisation and performance.\nWhen the workshop finished Peter\nbroke down and wept with deep grief.\nIt was the first time since his accident,\nseveral years before, that he had cried.\nHis tears were not only for his loss of\nsight but also tears of appreciation at\nhaving found a new level of experience.\nThis experience opened up the future\nfor him. He has since entered the Royal\nNational College, in Hereford, England\nand qualified to become a masseur. He\nhas found direction and now expects to\ncombine his new-found skills in mas-\nsage with his old interests in sports and\nsports injuries.\nPeter is one of many blind people\nwho have come to contact improvisation\nworkshops that we have developed in\nEngland over the last five years. These\nworkshops are designed to extend the\nmovement vocabulary and creative\nexperience of the visually challenged\nand the professionals that work with\nthem. The blind who have danced with\nus come from all walks of life. Some\nhave been blind from birth, others have\nlost their sight in adulthood through\ndegenerative diseases, accidents and\ndiabetes. The professionals include\nsocial workers, recreation officers,\nteachers and dancers who work to make\ndance accessible to disabled people;\nmost of the professionals are sighted but\na few of them are visually impaired.\nIf you are born without sight there are\nprofound implications for your physical\ndevelopment as well as your social and\nintellectual/cultural life. The blind\nperson is inhibited from freely moving\nfrom one place to another by the fear of\nfalling over or bumping into things and\nby a confusion in spatial orientation.\nThose who are congenitally blind spend\nmuch of their lives at home, sitting or\nlying down. The paucity of the every-\nday movements of walking, sitting down\nand getting up means that the muscles\nin their feet and legs do not develop\ntheir potential. Through lack of use,\ntheir muscles are underdeveloped, flac-\ncid and poorly toned. These character-\nistics are also reflected in posture; the\ntorso is often limp, the head hanging\nforward. The essential movement needs\nof the body are often met by a gently\nrepetitive rocking motion in the seated\nposition. This rocking is generally\ndiscouraged by family and professionals\nas it is considered to be a 'blind-\nism '-i.e., a movement or gesture which\nis not found in the sighted world and\nwhich is seen as a stigma.\nIn those people who have seen for\nsome years but lost their sight in adult\nlife there is another set of bodily re-\nsponses. These people do not generally\nexhibit blindisms. Their gestural vocab-\nulary is consonant with that of the dom-\ninant sighted culture, but their loss of\nsight prohibits normal everyday move-\nment. The trauma and anxiety which\naccompanies visual loss is reflected in a\nchronic level of muscular tension which\nis so habitual as to make muscular\nrelaxation a forgotten experience. they,\ntoo, stand and wait for someone with\nsight to guide them to another seat in\nanother room where they can safely\n'park' their bodies.\nAlthough there are some programmes\nof physical education available to the\nblind these are mostly purely functional\nand often mechanised. For example,\nthere is tandem cycling, or jogging a\ncourse that is marked out by a rope\nwhich the blind person can hold onto, or\nthe treadmill or weight lifting machines\nthat are available in a modern gym.\nWhilst a few of the visually impaired\nmake great efforts to keep themselves in\ntrim by going to the gym, they generally\nreport a sense of boredom with the\nrepetitive and socially isolated nature of\nmany of the exercise regimes open to\nthem.\nContact improvisation seemed an\nideal activity for the blind, based as it is\nin the ·natural physics of movement, in\nhuman communication, and focused on\na touch-based learning path rather than\na 'seeing and copying' mode endemic in\nso many dance classes.\nThe inherently democratic nature of\ncontact improvisation makes it a particu-\nlarly good form for the so-called dis-\nabled who deal continuously with dis-\nabling social attitudes and relationships.\nFor example, Janee, who is partially\nsighted, had left the workshop with\nRose, a sighted arts worker. They were\nsitting in a car at a petrol station when\nRose was approached by a lady who\nwas collecting for charity. \"How old is\nshe,\" the lady asked Rose a8suining that\nbecause Janee is blind she must also be\ndeaf and possibly intellectually retarded.\nJanee answered her. \"I am 24.\" The\nwoman continued to ignore her whilst\nfocussing on her. \"Can't they do any-\nthing for her,\" she persisted. \"It's a\nterrible shame... Still, labradors are\nlovely dogs.\"\nEven Fred Raffle, a man who has\nrisen to the top in the field of blind\neducation, and who was blind from\nbirth, revealed that sighted co-profes-\nsionals could not stop their caring role.\nThis means that even though be is the\nboss, he has to deal with paternalistic\nattitudes which infantalise, patronise and\nstigmatise. In the workshops however,\nhe found the politics more nearly equal,\nfeeling that through the contact improvi-\nsation structures, he was met as himself,\nrather than as a person with a disability.\nThe workshops which we have devel-\noped are always \"integrated\" in the\nsense that they include both sighted and\nblind people who work in an equal\npartnership as they learn contact impro-\nvisation together. -\nA class in contact improvisation for\nsighted people involves ''pre-tuning\" the\nsenses from the normal sighted domi-\nnance to the sense of touch. In an\nintegrated class this occurs very con-\nsciously because of empathy with a\nblind partner. It can be an intense expe-\nrience to assume a state of mind in\nwhich the visual world plays no part at\nall in the reference systems. This shock\nis a most salutary one, giving a high\ncontrast to the differences between one\nsense, vision, and the other, touch.\nUsually the transition from the vistlal-\nlly dominant world into the world of\ntouch is gradual, and the sighted student\nsenses the change less acutely than\nwhen dancing with the blind. We have\nseen students who resisted any empathic\nconnection however, leaving a dance\nwith a blind partner who then had to\nstand in place waiting for aid. Or the\nstudent who was so inattentive that after\na two week workshop, when asked to\nrun an exercise for the group, she real-\nized that she didn't know how to refer\nto the blind group. In a loud aside to\nAnne, she said, \"What do you call\nthem?\"\nShe had missed the point and the\nopportunity of the workshop. The peo-\nple who have lost their sight have an\nincreased concentration in the other\nsenses, and working with a blind partner\nis an education in touch 'density'.\nConcentration of sighted students will\nwaver between touch and vision. The\nconcentration of the blind will not\nwaver.\nTransmitting the principles of an\nexercise to the class can be taxing. To\nfurther the democratic ideal one at-\ntempts to describe the positions in a\nway that both populations can under-\nstand. Even though an obvious point of\nintegration is for the visually able to see\nthe demonstration, to facilitate transmis-\nsion so that each of the blind can have\nan example from which to learn by\ntouch, at the same time, one strives to\npresent careful, clear pictures in the\nlanguage. It is astonishing how quickly\nthe language itself flounders, however.\nWe have a personal reference sys-\ntem-'right and left', and the more ob-\njective 'north and south' or other exter-\nnal references. For the blind the most\nimportant of these is the personal sort of\nreference. If everyone is facing the\nsame direction and reacting at the same\ntime, then instructions go well. When\nthings get a little chaotic, we've found\nthat overly-general directions result in a\nnumber of different interpretations\nwhich, if not corrected, can lead to\nconfusion and loss of confidence. Even\nwhen they are corrected, the time spent\nand tone of voice may feel overly tech-\nnical. This taught us to use methodical\nsteps, careful verbal introductions to any\nexercise, coupled with an attempt at a\ncasual, conversational air.\nFor those who have no movement\ntraining and poor muscle tone, the phys-\nical approach has to be clear and soft.\nThis has called for an analysis of exer-\ncises to try to determine what exactly is\nsuitable in this situation. The propor-\ntions and durations of things have to be\nconsidered. Relaxation and massage are\nbrought in frequently. Exercises requir-\ning just one part of the body to relax in\nisolation, such as 'floating the head' or\n'arm drop', are very useful. Exercises\nwhich can strengthen longer connections\nbetween limbs and torso are used.\nApparently the real juice of the work-\nshops which include the blind is the\ncontact improvisation itself. It is this\nwhich produces the feelings of self-\nempowerment, joy and satisfaction.\nThere are deeply felt, difficult emotions\nand painful social configurations which\naccompany the loss of a person's sight;\nhowever, our working contract is physi-\ncal rather than psychotherapeutic. In\nthese workshops, as in all other contact\nimprovisation sessions, the teaching\nfocuses on the issues of weight, mass,\ngravity, leverage and movement design.\nIn the teaching, we acknowledge con-\nnections between emotions and muscular\ntensions, but formal space for the ex-\npression of emotions is reserved for the\nclosing process of the workshops.\nPeter's catharsis was the most extreme\nthat we have seen and occurred within\nthe formal structuring of the closing\nphase.\nAlthough many others have moist\neyes and sometimes tears, the most fully\nand frequently expressed feelings are\noverwhelmingly positive. Objectively\nwe can see that the emotional landscape\nis accompanied by a changed physi-\ncality-improved complexions, relaxed\nfeatures, lowered shoulders, alert pos-\nture, more confident gait and increased\nanimation. The participants' own im-\nprovisations have provided the means\nwhereby these changes have taken\nplace.*",

    "Text": "For a few days I felt quite out of tune\nwith friends and acquaintances. I just\nwanted to withdraw and relive the expe-\nrience, and one of the first things I did\nwas to get out my sketch pad and draw\na complete sequence of all the move-\nments and partnerships I learned in the\nworkshop; I found that I had remem-\nbered every single one vividly.\nWhen I got to bed, at peace and very\nrelaxed, I had two strange experiences,\nwhich I suppose were sort of dreams.\nI was aware that I was lying inert in\nthe dark. I began to feel as though my\nhead was being gently drawn away from\nmy body; as though some kind of mag-\nnetic force was attracting me, and the\npull came first from one direction and\nthen another. The sensation was similar\nto that which we did during the head\nmassage exercise and I felt very elated,\nbut was aware that the force controlling\nthis sensation was not human. I wasn't\nafraid at this point, and the sensation\nthen faded and the sequence changed.\nI was aware of standing in a bare\nroom with white walls. I was only con-\nscious of my body from the waist up.\nWhile standing in the same spot my body\nstarted to make a circular movement\nfrom the waist. As I did this I began to\nget the same feeling as before; that a\nmagnetic force was drawing me upwards\nby the head. I felt myself rising upwards\ngaining speed and I could see the ceiling\ngetting closer. I remember feeling\nslightly afraid at this point because I\nwasn't quite in control and I thought I\nmight hit the ceiling, but I didn't, and\njust floated round and round the edges\nof the room as though on the end of a\npiece of elastic, til the intensity of the\nsensation woke me up.\nThis experience was all the more un-\nusual for me because I am not religious;\nhaven't done any form of meditation;\nhadn't had any alcohol and wasn't high\non anything.\nIt's only happened on that one occa-\nsion so far and I would like to find out if\nother people who've done the workshops\nhave had any kind of after-effects like\nthis?\nThere may be a connection between\nthis experience and a discovery I made\nsome years ago while undergoing some\nformal mobility training with the long\ncane, under blindfold. Much to my\ninstructor's bewilderment, I found that I\ncould sense objects from between 25 to\n50 yards away without making contact\nwith the long cane. I did this without\nsight or sound cues. I just felt a strong\nsense of claustrophobia when there were\nsolid objects in front of me, and relief\nand elation when there were wide open\nspaces. Since my mobility instructor's\nobjective was to teach me to detect ob-\nstacles with the cane, he was rather\nskeptical of this ability, and set me many\nchallenges. He hadn't encountered this\nin other clients, but did reveal that a\nsimilar thing was referred to as a rare\nphenomenon in his profession, and was\nknown as \"Shadow Sound.\"\nI disagree with this description: I\ndon't think it is a \"rare phenomenon\" ;\nnor has it got anything to do with\n\"sound.\" I think it has more to do with\na primitive instinct for self-preservation\nand dealing with the unknown, which is\ndormant in most people, and only comes\ninto play when they are deprived of one\nof the other senses.\nAnyway, I return to my observations\nabout the workshop.\nAn element of the workshop that ap-\npealed to me was that the only \"props\"\nwe needed were human partnerships.\nThrough the variety of exercises and\npartnerships I was involved in during the\nworkshop, I was able to initiate more\nambitious shapes and movements, confi-\ndent that I would get the support to\ncarry them through as well as anticipat-\ning and supporting my partner's inten-\ntions.\nI think the basic structure of the work-\nshop was sound, and there were only\ntwo instances where I experienced diffi-\nculty; though both of these were resolved\nduring the five day period.\nThe first was trying to respond, from\nthe perspective of a person with visual\nimpairment, to the mainly sighted imag-\nery used to describe some of the shapes\nwe were attempting to create, e.g., I\ndidn't understand Steve's reference to \"a\ndouble helix,\" which we were supposed\nto achieve when we were doing the\nrolling exercise. As I suggested at the\ntime, verbal description is necessary, but\ncould be more effective if it referred to\nfamiliar tangible objects. (I have since\nfound that I have a sea shell which is\neroded by the sand, and forms the exact\nshape I was trying to make.) I think this\npoint is important as I don't want to be\nin positions where I have to rely too\nheavily on a sighted partner's interpreta-\ntion.\nThe second occasion I experienced\ndifficulty occurred when one of my sight-\ned partners matched me up with a visu-\nally impaired person for the next se-\nquence in the workshop. I found that I\ncouldn't get any rapport or positive\ncontact going. This did shatter my con-\nfidence for the rest of the session that\nday, and although I did manage to re-\nsolve the issue with the person who\ninitiated it later, perhaps it might have\nbeen avoided if the basic ground rules\nwere spelled out more explicitly at the\nbeginning of the workshop.\nI enjoyed and benefited from the ex-\npertise of the professional sighted danc-\ners; and certainly didn't feel at all intim-\nidated by their experience. In fact I\nthink it is proof of the effectiveness of\nthe work that both sighted and visually\nimpaired participants were in a recipro-\ncal learning situation.\nFinally, one last comment. I recently\nread an article in the New Beacon about\nAmici (a dance group working with peo-\nple who have a wide range of both phys-\nical and mental disabilities). I hope that\n\"Touchdown\" doesn't go down this\nroad. The general public has two per-\nsistent, and prejudicial stereotypes about\nvisual impairment; we are either genius-\nes, or mentally retarded. I think mixing\ndisabilities as Amici does, often coefr.rms\nrather than banishes the second stereo-\ntype in particular. I for one, don't want\nany involvement in such an exercise.\nWell, I hope all these comments will\nbe of some help to you. The fact that I\nhave written at such length ~s quite\nunlike me, and you may take it as a\ntoken of my enthusiasm and commitment\nto Contact Dance.",

One of the aspects of my work\nis helping babies and parents \"bond.\"\nI feel Baby Contact is a perfect way to\nhelp parents attune with their babies.\nI have been experimenting with\nBaby Contact since my thirteen year\nold daughter Jenny was born. During\nthe summer of '77 I was working at\nthe School for Body-Mind Centering™\nand was fortunate to have had some\ncolleagues invite me to join in some\nContact Improvisation. I was fasci-\nnated. I was pregnant for the third\ntime and had danced and performed\nthrough all my pregnancies. Doing\nContact Improvisation while I was\npregnant felt like a trio (me, the fetus,\nand the other adult).\nIn addition to exploring BMC and\nContact Improvisation, I was also dis-\ncovering the Kestenberg work, a meth-\nod of observing movement and work-\ning with child/parent movement inter-\nactions. Influenced by these three\nbodies of work, I was experimenting\nwith dialoguing with the fetus in all\nsorts of ways: moving in the same\nrhythms that the fetus within me was\nmoving; initiating the movement;\nfollowing the fetal movements; leading\nfrom the uterus; vibrating the amniotic\nfluid with sound and movement; let-\nting the weight of the uterus or the\nfetus adjust my relationship with grav-\nity; as well as anything else that hap-\npened as a result of the continually\nchanging dialogue within my body.\nAfter Jenny was born, the natural\ncontinuation was to keep dancing, with\nher on my body, using the same dia-\nlogue-sometimes following, sometimes\nleading; two energies creating one\never-changing form, contacting each\nother through movement and stillness.\nMy Baby/Parent group began exper-\nimenting with Baby Contact, first the\nparent lying and breathing with their\nbaby, just listening to their baby; then\nfeeling their baby initiate movement, then responding in micro-movements\nto their baby's movement initiation.\nWe began very gently and very care-\nfully, combining initiating movement\nand responding to movement, moving\nand receiving, being motor and senso-\nry. Eventually we built the micro-\nmovements into larger movements that\nmoved through space. With Contact\none needs to be constantly feeling and\nre-evaluating, ready to instantaneously\nrespond as well as instantaneously act;\none needs to be open to receiving as\nwell as giving; responding as well as\ninitiating. That balance of give and\ntake, in and out, is an important attrib-\nute for parents as well as babies.\nIn addition, in Baby Contact, babies\nhave the power to move the environ-\nment, of initiating movement through\nspace, of being responded to physical-\nly, of initiating change. They also\nhave the experience of incorporating\nanother person's rhythm, of internaliz-\ning another person's movement and\nperhaps even developing it. They also\nhave the opportunity to see the world\nfrom many spacial perspectives, stimu-\nlating their vestibular system.\nMy students and I have enjoyed\nBaby Contact and have learned things\nwe could have learned in no other\nway. We have had.the opportunity to\nblend our adult bodies with our\nbabies' bodies into one movement.*",

    "Text": "I recently had an opportunity to\nteach contact improvisation (CD in\nMexico City, Mexico. \"The Winter\nWorkshop Intensive for Dance Profes-\nsionals,\" which took place at the\nInstituto Nacional de Bellas Artes\n(National Institute of Fine Arts), was\nattended by professional dancers and\ndance students from all over Mexico.\nFor three weeks I taught two 2-hour\nclasses a day, one with students and\nthe other with dance professionals.\nThe workshop took place from De-\ncember 1-20, 1991.\nOther instructors for this intensive\nwere Sara Pearson, Patrick Widrig,\nJeremy Nelson, Nancy Topf, and Dan-\niel Nagrin. Jaime Ortega and Marcella\nBroughton, who are dancers from New\nYork City, were our translators. The\norganizer of the event was Lidya Ro-\nmero, Director of Dance at the Insti-\ntuto. Lidya and our other hosts were\nvery gracious and the students were\nextremely receptive to new ideas, both\nin body and mind. They had been\nexposed to only a bit of CI before and\nwere mostly trained in Graham tech-\nnique, so I expected bodies that were\nnot malleable to CI, but I was wrong.\nThey learned the skills and form of CI\nvery well and were willing and able to\nintegrate this different movement\nparadigm into their bodies.\nThe workshop setting presented me\nwith the opportunity to rediscover the\nbeginnings of the CI form for myself.\nI decided to ask questions to help\nfocus my teaching: What is contact\nimprovisation? What is my point of\nview of the form? How is it taught to\ndancers who know very little about it?\nWhat is the essence of CI and its basic\nskills? What do I think are the most\nimportant things to get across about\nthe form? Even though I have taught\nCI to beginners many times, I felt\nmore responsible because this was\nanother country and the dance ideas\nout of which CI originated had not\npermeated their culture. Besides, it's\nexciting to start from the beginning\nagain after so many years. I enjoy\na:;:king questions and gaining new\nperspectives and getting fresh insights.\nI divided the basics into different\ncategories: internal skills such as\nawareness of inner space, including\ngravity, mass, weight, and volume;\nlearning to give and take weight; and\nfollowing a continually changing point\nof physical contact. There are also\nseveral senses that need to be devel-\noped when learning CI, whether\nlearned consciously or unconsciously.\nThese are the sense of weight shifting,\nthe proprioceptive sense, the kinesthe-\ntic sense, and the disorientation of the\nvestibular sense of balance.\nThere are also a number of physical\nskills that can be taught and practiced\nincluding \"nameable\" skills such as\nrolling, sluffing off, platforming and\ndraping, body surfing, falling, giving\nand taking weight, and counterbal-\nancing.\nDancing contact improvisation is\nabout learning a new movement lan-\nguage based on these senses and skills.\nCI is a type of whole body dance\ntechnique. You get the experience of\nthe body-as-a-unit. IT brings you to\nan altered state similar to that of an\nathlete. You become adrenalized and\nsensitive to lower brain reflexes so\nthat you are able to make split second\ndecisions about falling, breaking falls,\nand taking other physical risks. In\naddition, you learn to follow impulses\nfrom moment to moment and to com-\nmunicate those impulses through your\nbody. You also become adept at lis-\ntening to impulses from another body.\nI allotted plenty of time for open\ndancing so that skills and concepts\ncould be integrated into the dancing. I\nalso set up structures to allow for\ndiscussion from the point of view of\nthe dancers as well as from the obser-\nvers' perspective.\nI stressed that the form is about\ndancing from the inside out. First you\nbecome aware of and align with the\nphysical forces of nature. On the frrst\nday, I began with a body awareness\nexercise; while lying down, sense the\nmass, weight, volume, gravity, and\npoints of contact with the floor. In\nstanding, I led the experience of the\nsmall dance of tiny weight shift ad-\njustments we unconsciously do that\nkeep us in the vertical plane.\nThe next day I introduced the skill of\nfollowing a continually changing point\nof physical contact, as well as the\nconcept that weight shifting is a sense.\nOn the third day I did exercises to\nintroduce the idea of maintaining\nbalance while in disorienting relation-\nships to the ground.\nTo sum up, the concepts that I cov-\nered the first week are as follows: four\nsenses (proprioceptive, kinesthetic,\nvestibular (dis)orientation, and weight\nshifting); aligning with gravity, mo-\nmentum, and movement impulses;\nfollowing a continually changing point\nof physical contact; giving and taking\nweight; learning the art of controlled\nfree falling; listening with the body.\nAfter this first week of introducing\nthe concepts and doing some open\ndance structures, I wondered about\nwhich step to take next to get to the\ndancing form that I recognize as CL I\ndon't care whether people do ''pure\"\nCI or not I don't want to be pedantic\nsimply to maintain control, but to\ninsure safety. My interest is in shar-\ning the experience of freely falling\nthrough space and aligning with what\nCynthia Novack described. in her book\nSharing the Dance: Contact Improvi-\nsation and American Culture, as the\n\"third force\" that is both of you and\nneither of you.\nSkills are fun in and of themselves\nand they help you to find new places\nin your dancing. However, while\ndancing, you want to be feeling it\nfrom the inside rather than looking at\nit from the outside. CI is not only\nabout learning skills and doing them in\na dance. It is also about listening and\ncommunicating. It is about sensing\nwhere the impulses and motivation for\ndancing originate. It is about discov-\nering the place where the impulses\ncome out of your physical relationship\nto each other and the physical forces\nthat you share while in contact The\nmovement ideas arise out of this\nshared energy relationship.\nI had these thoughts during the\nround robins, because although the\nstudents were extremely open to the\nform and the energy ran high, it dissi-\npated very soon instead of building or\ngrowing. I wanted to show techniques\nfor letting the momentum of a dance\nbuild and also for finding different\nenergy states within a dance.\nTherefore, for a focus during the\nsecond week, I decided to work with\nthe elements of air, water, earth, fire\nand ether as originally presented in CI\nby Nancy Stark Smith. In addition, I\nwanted to expand on disorientation\nconcepts as a way of letting go of the\n'egohead' of dancing and allowing the\nbody's reflexive responses to take\nover. I also continued teaching skills I\nhad introduced in the first week.\nThe \"elements\" turned out to be a\ngood way to talk about and feel the\ndifferent states and qualities that a\ndance can have. After a week of\nfocusing on skills and taking them into\nthe dancing, the element of fire (un-\nleashing wild and high energy) added\na quality of freedom to the dancing,\nand the dancers' creative resources\nseemed more accessible. It was also\nhelpful to use the polarity of air and\nearth (levity and gravity) and I focused\non how to mutate between these two\nstates. Doing water-flow dances with-\nout limb support was a helpful ap-\nproach to changing movement patterns.\nHowever, it was when I introduced\nthe element of ether (unpredictable\nqualities) that the dancing really be-\ncame engaging, both to watch and to\ndo. Up to that point they had been\ntied to a form based on a continuum\nfrom skills to dancing, much like\nballet where steps are combined to\nmake a dance. With the ether concept,\nthere is a whole range of movement\nqualities that are available to the danc-\ner, and what I feel is the inherent\nunpredictability of CI duet dancing\nbecame accessible. Dance structures\nlike the round robin could remain\nenergized much longer and with more\nvariety in movement, qualities, and\ndynamics. The personality of each\nperson came out which added texture\nto the dancing.\nFor the third week I allotted plenty\nof time for open dancing and discus-\nsion. I feel that the way to get better\nat CI is to do it (a radical thought\nindeed) and discuss it I also taught\nsome more advanced skills such as\nrunning and jumping onto a partner,\nwindmills and other dynamic lifts,\nhandstand techniques, and dancing\nscores.\nEach day, the dancing was getting\nprogressively more recognizable to me\nas the CI I have seen in its many\npermutations. The communication was\nclearer and the dancing developed\nfrom the contact instead of from the\nwillful mind. A feeling of trust within\nthe form and within the group was\nbecoming more apparent\nTo culminate the experience of the\nthree weeks, during the final day we\ncombined the classes and did a contact\njam with the students and profession-\nals together. The dancing was highly\nskillful and at an extremely high ener-\ngy level. I was gratified to see the\ndancing become more fully realized\nwithin the form. It reminded me of\nthe early days of CI in the U.S. where\nexperimentation and an attitude of\ntesting one's limits prevailed.\nThere were limitations in having\nonly three weeks of teaching time.\nFor example, the slow, sensuous quali-\nty that CI can have was not present\nenough to offset the high energy,\nadrenalized dancing that dominated the\nopen dancing sessions. I would have\nliked to have had more time to allow\nthe dancers to engage in many types\nof dance energies and qualities, and to\nexplore extending the form in other\nways. However, I think that this will\nall come when the physical limits have\nbeen fully tested. The form will grow\nfrom the unique combination of ener-\ngies of these dancers in Mexico. Who\nis to know or judge what new direc-\ntions the form might take in this un-\ntapped environment?\nDuring the third week, I made Shar-\ning the Dance and four issues of Con-\ntact Quarterly available during class\ntime and there was much interest in\nthese publications. I encouraged them\nto write to let CQ know what is hap-\npening in Mexico regarding CI and\nrelated dance. They expressed an\ninterest in having contact jams and\nopen improvisaiton sessions in Mexico\nCity. It will be interesting to see what\ndevelops. In closing, I would like to\nthank Lid.ya Romero, Instituto Nacio-\nnal de Bellas Artes, the organizers,\nand the students for making the work-\nshop possible and a total pleasure. I\nappreciated the dancers' openness,\nhigh energy, and graciousness. I hope\nthis is the beginning of a dance dia-\nlogue with the rich culture of\nMexico.*",

    "Text": "Joint Forces, a dance company founded by Alito Alessi\nand Karen Nelson, has presented four annual DanceAbility\nworkshops, sharing Contact Improvisation dance with\nhundreds of people, some able-bodied and some with vari-\nous physical disabilities. This year's DanceAbility, pro-\nduced by Alito, took place for 3 days in mid-March, 1991.\nEugene, Oregon is a city designed to be wheelchair\naccessible and has provided the Hilyard Community Center\nfor disabled folk as well. It is a handsome center, and as\nan able-bodied person, I enjoyed the extra space and wider\ndoors which result when a building is designed to accom-\nmodate people who use wheelchairs. A problem for many\ndisabled folk is our society's commercialization of space.\nIt can be difficult these days to get out of a car without\nchipping paint on the doors of three vehicles. Vans modi-\nfied to raise and lower wheelchairs need the equivalent of\ntwo spaces.\nSo, for those disabled people able to drive to the center\non Friday, it was easy to park, descend to ground level,\nwheel into the building with its automatically opening\ndoors, and attend the orientation meeting for DanceAbility.\nOriginally, DanceAbility was to be held at the Center,\nbut Saturday and Sunday's workshops had to be relocated\nto a more spacious high school gymnasium. The planners\nhad not foreseen the large turnout for the event; disabled\npeople are known stay-at-homes.\nSome disabled folk objected to the concept of the pur-\npose-built spanking-new community center for the disabled.\nThe problem is how to integrate the populations, not segre-\ngate them into separate facilities. Bruce Curtis noticed that\nthe men's toilet had no urinals, and though admitting it was\na detail, felt that it was a symptom of a lack of consider-\nation for the able-bodied, and as if all men with disabilities\nwere in wheelchairs.\nGetting pissed-off about the pissing facilities expresses\nthe sensitivity of the activist Bruce was invited to Dance-\nAbility as a facilitator. He is a quad-a quadriplegic-in a\nwheelchair, from San Francisco. He has been active in\nteaching and performing dances with his able-bodied part-\nner, Alan Ptashek. Alan is a veteran of a movement form\ncalled Contact Improvisation, a sort of partnered gymnastic\nimprovisation. He answered the phone one day and found\nBruce at the other end. Alan is a gifted partner and he and\nBruce, who has no control of his legs or fingers, began to\nwork out together.\nMost forms of dance partnership suppose that one part-\nner leads, the other responds: in CI however, either dancer\nmay initiate or respond. After the movement starts, a new\npossibility arises; to follow the momentums established and\nto continue them while remaining in touch with the other's\nbody. This is the 'contact' part of the form. The 'impro-\nvisational' aspect of it allows either partner to be in any\nposition relative to their partner or to the floor. Essentially\nit is old-fashioned touch dancing taken from the vertical of\nthe ballroom into the horizontals and obliques of wrestling,\nwith, hopefully, the ability of the snooker player to intuit\nmomental affects.\nBruce began dancing, I believe, from a political motive,\na desire to insure that the equality of the disabled folk was\naddressed; as well as his own need not to be marginalized,\nwhich included not letting his body degenerate in a wheel-\nchair. Bruce came to Eugene without Alan this year,\nwhich is a measure of their success, and drove up the coast\nin a VW bus he had modified to cope with his chair and\nthe ways that his limbs work.\nHe is accepted as a performer, invited as a teacher.\nHave we heard of a quadriplegic dancer-teacher before?\nNo, we have not.\nYet, at DanceAbility, Bruce was not unique. Charlene\nCurtiss teaches wheelchair aerobics in Seattle, for another\ninstance. Emery Blackwell has recently resigned the presi-\ndency of OIL (Oregonians for Independent Living) to\ndevote himself to dance. He has cerebral palsy to a degree\nwhich makes speaking difficult Words are stretched. tones\ndistorted. His vocal mechanisms and jaw, like the rest of\nhis body, reflect the aspect of CP which exaggerates the\nmotor nerve impulses, sometimes producing kicking and\nquavers in the legs, large arm gestures, flexed (athatoid)\nwrists and extraordinary finger movements.\nFor three years Emery has worked with Alito Alessi and\nthey have made a duet which uses the paraphernalia of the\ndisabled-wheelchairs and crutches. Alito recently had an\nextraordinary accident A bottle of carbonated water blew\nup and severed the muscles and tendons of the front of his\nright leg above the ankle, requiring surgery and extensive\nrehabilitation. So he has experienced a profound, if tempo-\nrary, disability. He was no stranger to the disabled; his\nmother was wheelchair-bound from an auto accident when\nhe was young, and his duet with Emery reflects his famil-\niarity in a playful way with the mechanics of the support\nsystems.\nEmery has also produced a short solo, for which he\nmade the music on his synthesizer.\nBruce, then, is not alone in taking the creative initiative\nin dance. It is an extraordinary thing they are all doing.\nWe have seen paintings produced by disabled artists; music\nof distinction has been composed by disabled musicians.\nHowever, dance uses the body as a medium. Unlike other\narts, when one looks at a dance made by somebody who is\ndisabled one is looking at the dance and also the disability.\nThis contravenes our society's protocol regarding looking\nat the disabled. But theater exists in part to provide the\nopportunity for frank appraisal of human beings and per-\nhaps it suits the agenda of disabled performers to use the\ntheatrical conventions to allow us to get used to their con-\nditions. Then they get on with the creation of dance under\nthose conditions, without necessarily referring to them.\nThese thoughts arose because we saw two dance works\nfeaturing Emery at the introduction to the workshop. One\nwas the solo he choreographed in which he rolled across\nthe floor, rose to his knees, turned in place, and then de-\nscended and rolled away. What we see is that the rather\nsimple format of the dance is taxing. Emery is working at\nthe edge of his capabilities, just as many dancers do.\nHe is a striking man. The CP exaggerates his movements\nand features, but his long curly head of hair, his thin face\nwith goatee often wetted with saliva, his intelligent and fre-\nquently merry blue eyes suggest a character of some flam-\nboyance. Bruce once said that the disabled are either\nignored or viewed as martyrs. But I think Emery would be\nextraordinary even if the facade of CP did not provide such\na lavish filter through which to appreciate his spirit and\nthoughts.\nEmery's spirit lights up his actions and face. His\nthoughts are thoughts set in a new body language.\nEmery has said that to get his arm raised above his head\nrequires about 20 seconds of imaging to accomplish.\nExtension and contraction impulses in his muscles fire\nfrequently and unpredictably, and he must somehow select\nthe right impulses consciously, or produce for himself a\nmovement image of the correct quality to get the arm to\nrespond as he wants. We observers can get entranced with\nwhat he is doing with his mind. More objectively, we can\nsee that as he tries he excites his motor impulses and the\nrandom firing happens with more vigor. His dancing has a\nbuilt-in Catch-22. And we feel the quandary and see that\nhe is pitched against his nervous system and wins, with\neffort and a kind of concentration we haven't seen before.\nHe has mechanisms in his mind we able-bodied have not\nhad to learn. His facility with them allows us to feel them\nsubtly in our own minds.\nThe taste of this we get during the short solo is much\namplified in the duet with Alito. This dance is longer and\nrequires that Emery be where he needs to be in time to\ncoordinate with Alito. The choreography provides a new\nfilter to show us the man. The CP appears to mask the\nlogic and intent until events show us that what we see has\nbeen carefully calculated by Emery and Alito.\nCan these dances avoid the obvious trap of being curios-\nities, grotesqueries, or analytical, quasi-medical displays?\nIt depends on the artistry, of course, and the failures of this\nnew geme will probably be absorbed politely, just as the\ntheatrical misadventures of the able-bodied usually are.\nTheoretically I see no problem. Usually we think of\ndance as the development of human movement potential to\nsuperhuman levels. Another way to look at dance tech-\nniques is to notice that they exclude more movement po-\ntentials than they develop. Ballet works in the realm of\nextension of the limbs. It does not include the contractions\nof Martha Graham nor the asymmetry and sexy pelvis of\njazz. Each of these techniques operates within its own\nlogic, and each may borrow or quote from other systems,\nbut at heart they are defined by how they are limited.\nThese definitions are aesthetic ones, though, and it is a\ndifference of kind when the limitations are the result of\nmischance or malady.\nBut we quickly grasp the logic of the limitation, be it\naesthetic choice or physical disability, and this is the point\nat which the mind and spirit of the performers take over to\nconvey us through the moments they are there to perform.\nI have seen awful Balanchine ballets. I have seen balleri-\nnas with superb bodies who could not hold my attention\nfor sixty seconds. And conversely, I have seen disabled\nperformers who, without evoking pity or morbid fascina-\ntion, kept me riveted to their work.\nJose Limon, a famous modem dancer, once said he felt\nmost alive when on stage. I have similar feelings, which\nmay be hard to understand by those who don't perform\nregularly. What happens is that the rigidity and self-con-\nsciousness of stage fright change to fluid extra power and\ndeeper self-awareness. For that moment you have more of\nyou. I guess it is adrenalin and other hormones surging\nthrough one's system, which mixes with one's own feelings\nand the feelings of the audience--who are there to witness\nfeelings, after all. What a broth.\nFor Bruce and Emery, perhaps this performance high is\nthe same. I view performance as an empowerment, and a\nhealing, or wholing. They may have found this as well.\nThere is something in it for them, in other words. And if\nthey find it, their transcendence will fuel our transcen-\ndence.\nWill we find it more natural to design the disabled into\nour urban environments because they will be in/on our\nminds? Or are we struck with novelty? Will it wear thin?\nThe audience at the Center absorbed the performances\nwith appreciation and then watched a video of last year's\nDanceAbility workhsop so they could see what they were\nin for on the weekend.\nSATURDAY ...\nWe were all together from eleven until six p.m., about\n60 people at any one time, and slightly fewer disabled than\nable-bodied which is a comfortable ratio. Not all the\ndisabled needed help, mind you. Those with CP did:\nEmery, Jeff, Pete, Dana, for instance, are wheelchair\nbound, and also need others to be 'hands' for them.\nJan however is a single amputee who walks with crutch-\nes. She teaches skiing and could sit to the floor on her leg\nand arise as easily. She needed no assistance.\nRhoda was my partner for an initial contact improvisa-\ntion and then a verbal introduction. Having introduced\nourselves to each other, we were to then join a circle and\nintroduce our partner to the others in the group. I gave\nRhoda my history first. She replied with, \"I have an over-\neating disorder. And I was molested as a child.\" It\nseemed clear that she was introducing herself as alter-\nabled. So not everyone had physical dis-ablements.\nNow I looked around the room with a new attitude, and\na sense that even those of us with virtually no cause to\nconsider ourselves disabled might in fact be there for other\nreasons that a good workout and altruism.\nI asked Rhoda if I should introduce her as frankly as she\nhad introduced herself to me. She said I should. At the\nend of that session a couple of women thanked her for her\nforthrightness. Indeed, why shouldn't people simply de-\nclare what happened and clear their air? Rhoda was seek-\ning an experience of safe touch. I believe she found it on\nthis weekend, as we all did.\nWe also got a lot of exercise and physical challenge. It\nwas at first difficult to manipulate a body in or out of a\nrolling wheelchair. People not in chairs quickly discovered\nwhere the brakes were, and learned the advantageous ways\nto extend the dance beyond the chair. Not that the chair\ndido 't have a lot of possibilities. Certainly square-dancing\narm figures could be used between partners of different\nabilities. And the chairs are designed for strength so it is\npossible to clamber up on top of a seated partner, to lay\nacross the armrests, to catch a ride on a backstop or foot-\nrest.\nSeveral children spent little time in their chairs; being\nsmall they spent a lot of time being carried, flown and\nrocked.\nOthers were heavy to lift and manipulate, and all avail-\nable contact improvisation skills were used to turn the\ntransitional moments into fluid ones. It certainly seemed\npossible that someone would be dropped. But it became\nclear that those who could leave their chairs enjoyed the\nadventure, and those who couldn't such as Bjo Ashwill\nwith arthritis and a recently operated hand still in traction,\nknew their limits, which were respected by their partners.\nAs the information that we were in a safe touch, safe\nadventure environment dawned on us, the warmth grew.\nFirst came safety, then came warmth. Then came ... well,\nwhat one goes dancing for. Meeting people, doing and\nseeing unusual things, finding physical challenge while\nlaughing. Being moved.\nOur Western society has marginalized physicality. Not\njust to mention the voluntary couch potatoes, or car pota-\ntoes, or office potatoes. We marginalize physicality by\nsmoothing the environment, contriving convenience. By\nremoving its challenges we reduce the environment's abili-\nty to stimulate our potentials. There is a trap laid for us by\ncity planners and architects, decorators and designers-the\ncouching of the country. We adore youth, but what with\none thing and another-parenthood, jobs, etc.-we lose it\ntoo early, then cling to its superficial qualities with makeup\nand varieties of cosmetic surgery. News services distribut-\ned a 'filler' this last summer: the same percent of the U.S.\npopulation is overweight today as was in the 1960s. The\njoggers are more evident, the potatoes are not in the public\neye.\nSo if it is normal for us to marginalize physicality, the\nfolk who are disabled are relegated to an even more sedate\nexistence. Emery, however, has found a way out. He is a\nnotorious bicycle rider. He tours Eugene for hours most\ndays, cycling 30-40 miles on a bike specially designed for\nhim. With this and dancing with Alito he has a body\npacked densely with muscle; and when he is lifted, the\nhoister quickly realizes that, although he appears slim and\ncannot control many actions, his is an athletic body.\nGerry Overington, who is blind, finds most available\nforms of exercise boring. Tandem cycling or running,\nwithout the visuals, is just work for the legs and a little\nwind on the face. Touch dancing with a sighted partner\nallows Gerry to move his body freely, without worry about\nthe space. Gerry has become proficient at contact improvi-\nsation because it provides the fun of moving, and because\nhe and his partner meet as equals in the sense of touch.\nFor the quads, paraplegics, CPs, etc., the exploration of\nspherical movement retains its thrills, and the kinetic plea-\nsure of leaving the chair and having a dance which in-\ncludes rolling, taking and giving weight, guiding and being\nguided, accelerating, pausing, and balancing alone provides\nenormous stimulation. Emery and Pete seemed to become\nrapturous when dances went well.\nThe spirit of the event was nothing like the usual physi-\ncal therapy. In fact there is no 'therapeutic contract' with\nthe participants. The contract is to experience contact\nimprovisation.\nWith the video and the performances of Friday evening\neveryone had a notion of what it is. But teaching it physi-\ncally is another, more complex, matter. A group including\nvarious disabilities is like a United Nations of the senses.\nInstructions must be translated into specifics appropriate for\nthose on legs, wheels, crutches and must be signed for the\ndeaf. Demonstrations must be verbalized for those who\ncan't see, which is in itself a translating skill, because\nEnglish is not a very flexible language in terms of the\nbody.\nQuestions and discussions may be slowed by the inabili-\nty of some of the participants to speak clearly, or at all.\nPete, for instance, communicates by glancing at letters and\nnumbers on a plexiglass board. Sighting through the plas-\ntic and meeting Pete's gaze, the reader can see the letter\nPete is looking at When it is verbally identified, he\nchanges to the next letter. This is ingenious, if laborious,\nbut Pete's patience never seems strained. Several children\nwere both physically disabled and deaf, and Penny, a fluent\nsigner, was on hand to ensure they weren't left out\nBruce called the large group to order every so often and\ntalked about skills of weight-giving or rolling. Perhaps he\nwas not so concerned with imparting skills as changing the\natmosphere from the good-natured chaos which tended to\nprevail to one where anyone who was confused., or in an\nunhappy partnership could find ground and conscious\nchange.\nThe rest of us who were there to facilitate, Karen Nel-\nson, K.J. Holmes, Riccardo Morrison, Alito and I, tended\nto roam the gymnasium looking for difficulties. We would\nexpect at least some minor difficulties in such a huge\nmixed group of relative non-dancers, but few if any were\nfound over the weekend. I think we tended to err on the\nside of caution. Folk who weren't dancing were choosing\nto watch or rest But their presence at the event spoke for\nthem. They had come to dance.\nSUNDAY ...\nAnd dance they did. All day Saturday, all day Sunday.\nBy Sunday afternoon the gym was spread with picnic\nlunches and people were casually sharing their food. I sat\naround a generous spread with a number of others, and\nrealized that most of it had been provided by Rhoda, with\nher overeating disorder, who had brought enough for others\nwho might have overeating disorders. It was consumed.\nPeople talked and laughter echoed often. Children of\nparticipants played in and out of groups, appropriating\nempty wheelchairs to play in. Being children of disabled\nparents meant they knew how to use them.\nOne toddler had bells on her shoes. Her main amuse-\nment was to toddle, and the jingle on her feet let her moth-\ner, a young blind woman, know where she was.\nWhat her mother didn't see was that her daughter tod-\ndled in and out of dancing spaces where adults were con-\ntending with difficult balancing and fairly high-level physi-\ncal forces. Occasionally gasps were raised among watch-\ners. But the child spent ten hours over the weekend doing\nthis and never came to harm. She just tinkled through\nwhizzing wheelchairs and under lifted adults, the bells\ngiving us some warning that she was there. Perhaps hav-\ning a blind mother gave her a sense of responsibility for\nher own seeing and moving far beyond her years, because\nrarely did anyone have to alter movement to accommodate\nher, and finally everyone accepted that she could partici-\npate as she pleased.\nAnother woman brought two kids, a boy of about 8, and\na small, sweetfaced girl about 4. This child was not as\nindependent as tinkle-toes, and sometimes wanted to crash\nher mother's dances-to join in the fun or reclaim her\nmother's physical attention. Her brother however, with\nmany a strange noise and apparently casual intervention,\nwould divert his little sister. He would step in the way or\ninvent a pulling game, or distract her with a fantasy image.\nSometimes this didn't work. When she persisted, she was\nwelcomed into the dance by both dancers. Or mom would\nsee that her daughter did need some individual attention\nand excuse herself to dance with her. The boy's job was\neffective though. Part sheepdog, part Charlie Chaplin, he\nmanaged to give his mother a lot of dancing time.\nPete's Story\nPete Theophanes, 19, had in Emery a strong ally in com-\nmunication. Emery had taken him out for events and knew\nPete's situation at home. When Pete needed to express an\nurgent problem, Emery provided the background informa-\ntion which clued the rest of us into the picture. We were\npulled into the thick of it\nIt happened during a meeting of the whole group, when\none of the facilitators had called for a round robin, in\nwhich the group forms a circle and a few couples at a time\ndance in the center. Outside the main group, a few of us\nwere circled around Pete, taking turns reading through his\nletter board, trying to figure out what he wanted. Cerebral\npalsy happens at birth. If born with an inability to con-\nsciously control one's body, including speech, it can be a\nstruggle to convince the world to take one's mind serious-\nly. Pete's body has to be propped up in the wheelchair,\nwith both elbows tucked inside the armrests, or he slumps\nalarmingly to one side. His wrists are flexed 90 degrees.\nPete could control only the direction of his eyes. Before\nhe learned to read there must have been little communica-\ntion.\nOn Saturday he had a good time, I gather, because he\ncame again on Sunday, though against the wishes of his\ngrandparents, his guardians. They are devout Christians,\nand Sunday is the day for church. Nonetheless, they al-\nlowed Pete to return for the middle part of Sunday's work-\nshop.\nPete didn't want to go home. He wanted to explain that\nwe should call his aide and tell him to come at 6 rather\nthan at 4 p.m. But as interpreters we were too tired to\nkeep this long sequence of letters in mind. Emery sat\npondering as several of us tried and failed. Suddenly he\ngot it and said, \"What about your grandparents? We'll\nhave to phone.\"\nPete's excitement was contagious at this point. He was\ngrinning and sighting out his message: \"Phone her, tell her\nI'll be home at 6. And hang up before she can answer.\"\nIt came to me to make that call. I could not follow\nPete's script, though. I had been warned about the strength\nof personality of Pete's grandmother, and in the event my\nproposal of a two-hour extension for Pete was swept aside.\nPete had to get ready for church. His driver was coming.\nThese aides are sometimes in delicate relationships.\nWhen Pete's aide learned what Pete wanted, he was tom\nbetween Pete's needs and rights, and the agreed arrange-\nments. Pete was proposing to change that arrangement on\nhis own, yet if the aide granted Pete that power, he would\nbe dismissed, or in hot water, at least. Pete, at 19, is\nlegally able to determine his own schedule. And grandpar-\nents might be old-fashioned, stuck in their ways, and over-\nprotective. But an agreement had been made.\nThose engrossed with Pete and this issue, an island\nwhere time went by in the single letters of the complex\nstory, were Emery, Alito, the aide, myself and a young\nwoman named Gani. Though sympathetic to Pete's de-\nsires, we were counselling a pragmatic approach: don't\njeopardize your aide and stress your grandparent's generos-\nity for just two more hours of fun. It could curtail future\nchances.\nGani, to her credit, said, \"Having heard their advice, if\nyou still want to stay I'll support your decision.\"\nPete needed that support. Circumstances had deprived\nhim of the power to execute his wishes. Friends coun-\nselled against his direction. But at least one person put\nPete's wishes at top priority. Gani recognized his right to\ndo a thing, albeit a rash one, and kept her focus right there,\nrather than looking sagely at the larger picture. When I\nreturned from the phone call and told Pete what his grand-\nmother said, Pete emitted a peculiar sound. It was a shriek\nthrough clenched teeth. The intensity of frustration was\nominous, but quickly passed-on the outside.\nPete was invited to a last dance, and was lifted into the\nair by four dancers, and soon was smiling down at us as\nthey paraded by. His aide allowed this little extra time,\nthen Pete left; back to a world where there would be no\nparades, nor much movement at all. He would, we were\ntold, be taken from bed in the morning to a couch, where\nhe would watch T.V. and his spasming legs would be tied\nto protect him from falling off. Or on fair days, he would\nbe wheeled into the yard for airing and sunning, his arms\ntucked inside the armrests of his chair. No wonder he\nenjoyed the movement this weekend.\nI hope his tardiness didn't harm his relationship to his\naide, or to Emery who had invited him. Emery believes\nPete can live, as Emery does, in a place of his own with an\naide. Knowing someone who believes this encourages Pete\nto try to achieve it. How does a person get from here to\nthere but by belief? What encourages belief like the agree-\nment of one's 'big brother'? Emery is important to Pete.\nUntil the last moment before DanceAbility began it was\nnot clear that video coverage could be afforded. Tom\nGiebink, from Austin, agreed to exchange taping for partic-\nipation and made a visual record of the weekend.\nThe tapes usually focus on a pair of dancers and some\nexciting moments were preserved. But beyond the immedi-\nate subjects the background extends like a savannah and\nthe event is rather like a wildlife film-herds on the Seren-\ngeti of Africa, with different animals grazing and interact-\ning peacefully, young ones tripping through the foreground,\nencounters, withdrawals, peripheral activities.\nThis effect is heightened by the live music which was\nprovided on Sunday by Suse Millimon. It was amplified\nvoice and keyboard with long chords. The atmosphere it\nmade was meditative and earthy.\nTo shoot the fmal meeting Sunday afternoon, Tom sat in\nthe center of the circle around which we all sat or squatted,\nhunkered down in. It was a moment for every voice to be\nheard, or read. People spoke up when there was silent\nspace and they felt moved. Most participants thanked the\nother participants, and the organizers. It was difficult not\nto be a little teary inside. We bad spent three days togeth-\ner and a warm bond had grown. Everyone bad bad fun,\nbeen treated with dignity; so we respected each other and\nfelt an intense vicarious pleasure in each other's smiles and\nlaughter.\nA large family group was beaded by the Klopen-Owens,\na couple from Corvallis, Caucasian, who have 4 kids-at\nleast 3 of whom were from India, two of whom were deaf,\none of these with CP as well. He was Dana, a small 9\nyear-old.\nDana is a bit athatoid, like Emery, with bent wrists, and\nis unable to stand alone. At some point Sunday morning\nAlito had placed him in my arms. He was a light bundle\nand felt fragile. During this dance I became hopelessly\nconfused about Dana.\nFor one thing, he had frequent involuntary movement of\nhis head which was, in ordinary body language, 'no'.\nWhen he became excited he squealed. His smile was\nbright and handsome, but when he was asked a question,\nthe effort of answering caused it to fade. The sort of\nquestion I asked was, \"Is this OK?\" The smile would fade,\nthe head shake 'no'.\nWhen carried on my shoulder, he shouted, \"Dad, Dad!\"\nand shrilled a squeal. A bit insecure by this point, I as-\nsumed he was frightened. Later I discovered he just want-\ned his dad to see him, like most kids.\nBut most perplexing was an event which occurred mid-\ndance. The enormous gymnasium was constructed with a\nraised center ceiling panel, and between this and one of the\nside panels a forlorn basketball was lodged, having soared\nand stuck. Lifting Dana high, I said, \"Do you see that\nbasketball?\" and he immediately said, \"How did it get\nthere?\"\nSo ordinary. Later I was told that Dana was deaf, and I\nnever heard another sentence from him. It does sometimes\nhappen; a state of grace slips in during an unconsidered\nmoment, and clarity emerges. But when self-conscious or\nunder social pressure, grace goes and communication is\nstrained with the distortions and complications attending\nthe affliction.\nPenny used sign language with him, and we have on\ntape what I take as an interesting misunderstanding be-\ntween them. Alito was dancing with Dana, and Penny\nchanced by. Alito asked her to ask Dana if what he was\ndoing was OK.\nShe sign-mimed the question. Dana thought it over. His\nsmile faded, his head shook from side to side, and with\neffort he made a sound To me it sounded affmnative.\nPenny thought it was negative and asked if he wanted to\ngo slower, if anything had hurt his body. Dana struggled\nto reply. He had trouble coordinating 'yes' and 'no'. Now\nhe had to convey that nothing hurt, and that he loved to\nfly.\nAlito intuited what was going on and said, \"Naw, he\nwants to go fast, don't you?\" Dana grinned. So Alito,\nholding Dana in the cup of his belly, rocked over back-\nwards, and continued to rock forward and back, higher and\nhigher. Dana's smile got bigger and wider.\nLater I saw Dana's father flying him. With his hands\nunder Dana's arms, he swooped him up from the floor,\ncircling him high into the air and back to the floor. This\nprobably was what Dana was accustomed to.\nAs we were saying goodbye to each other in the final\ngroup circle, Dana's mother and father spoke for their kids.\nThey thanked all of us who had touched their children's\nlives, and Mrs. Klopen-Owen thanked us all for giving her\na day off. \"We did hope that Dana would meet others like\nhim. It isn't easy for a little guy with CP to find a role\nmodel. But luckily for him, Dana has found Emery, and\nhas something for him.\"\nAnd with that, Mr. Klopen-Owen held up Dana's arm.\nClutched in the small hand was a yellow scrap of paper.\n\"His address!\"\nDana's head was, for once, not wavering. His gaze was\nfixed on Emery, and he grinned hugely as his arm was\nraised.\nAlito Alessi, Pete Theophanes and Emery Blackwell\nat DanceAbility, 1991.\nBut then no one knew what to do. A protocol had been\ntacitly accepted not to give aid unnecessarily. So his\nparents did not convey the address, or Dana, across the\ncircle to Emery. Dana fidgeted off of his father's lap, and\na few feet beyond Then his coordination failed him and\nhe lay, limbs moving uselessly, still trying to get to Emery.\nEmery was hip to it and reacted quickly. He heaved\nhimself off the several friends he was draped across and\nheaved and rolled, just as in his solo, over the expanse of\nthe gym floor.\nNo one moved to help him, either.\nSpasmodically, grotesquely, Emery humped over to\nDana. He attempted to take the paper, but a further prob-\nlem emerged; neither he nor Dana could make their hands\nwork to make the transfer. Emery's fingers were all coil-\ning with effort, but not coordinating. Dana's hand could\nnot unclench. Emery began to emit groans.\nFailing to refine his motor effort, Emery tried to envelop\nDana, address and all. Both were, at this point, on the\nfloor at angles to each other and no available coordination\ncreated the cuddle which was intended In the attempt,\nEmery was flailing Dana with his wrists, and emitting\ninvoluntary roars of effort.\nDana was mostly without expression, looking dazed\nFortunately a smile appeared to reassure us viewers that he\nwas not frightened by the energy directed at him. He\nmight well have supposed that his role model was trying to\ndevour him. Dana managed to unloose the note. It fell\nonto Emery's chest, then to the floor between them.\nEmery knew he couldn't manage the finesse of picking a\npaper up from the floor, and rose unsteadily to his knees\nabove Dana. His arms stretched out from his shoulders\nand his wrists bent down with fmgers writhing like sea\nanemonies. He looked like a mad magician triumphantly\nincanting over his victim; or possibly about to topple on\nhis victim.\nBut then, all these images are beside the point. These\nare masks, the body language thrown up by CP, which\ncause a confusion in interpretation.\nAll Emery was trying to do was hug Dana, and this he\nmanaged, .sort of. He rolled Dana up against his knees,\nthen sank down beside him, pinned him with his forearm,\nand nuzzled Dana with his goatee. Dana grinned\nFinally someone from the circle spoke. \"Will anyone\ndescribe what's happening for those who can't see?\" It\nwas the stuff of old Russian novels, or operas, or long\nsilent films, but as I described it it flattened in my mouth\ninto a street comer encounter. What a high failure of\ncommunication. Fifty-eight people saw a moment of dra-\nma, and the blind heard only the plot line. The sighted\nheard my pitiful effort, but only a couple of people spoke.\nUnder the pressure of the moment we gave up and in\nsilence felt the gaps between the senses.\nEmery meanwhile was declaiming •.• something. \"Songay\newiri whyyeahh ooeyer.\" \"Someday,\" Emery was telling\nDana, \"we will ride bicycles together.\" +",

    "Text": "Emery has been a man with a physical\ndisability all his life. Being Emery, the\ndancer, is a new wrinkle. And he loves\nit\nAsked if he considered himself a danc-\ner or someone who plays with dancing,\nhe responded, \"I think in time I will\nstudy to be a dancer. At first, it was\nfun. I spent a few weekends and the\ntime moved on. Alito pushed me more\ninto dance and I got more into it after\nthat first performance of Wheels of For-\ntune. After I worked with Alito all win-\nter, I got hooked. Then I started ques-\ntioning if people took me as a dancer or\njust as a gimp. I would label myself a\nbeginning intermediate dancer. I know\nsome basic Contact, but I feel I am new\nwith it. You know, if it weren't for\nAlito, I wouldn't be dancing. He was\nopen-minded and positive. He even\nreminds me that my own movements\nare normal and natural. I keep forget-\nting, trying to dance like the able-bod-\nied. Me, thumping my knees on the\nfloor, is dancing. Not disability dance\ntechnique-but just plain dancing.\"\nAll this \"dance stuff' happened one\nday, several years ago, in 1988. Emery's\nfirst love was and still is bike riding.\nEmery was wheeling down the side-\nwalk on his three-wheeled cycle, a hel-\nmet on his head, strapped in like an\nastronaut straining against gravity and\npining for the open roads where he\ncould feel the wind racing past his face,\npushing against him in a rough and\nfriendly embrace, like wrestling with a\ngood buddy. Suddenly, a smiling man\nflagged him down and handed him a\nflyer, yapping on about some kind of\nDanceAbility workshop where people\nwith disabilities and able-bodied people\nget together and dance.\n\"It's called Contact Improvisation.\nYou'll love it,\" Alito continued.\n\"Sure,\" smiled Emery, taking his flyer.\nAnything to appease this very friendly,\nobvious nut \"Sure, I'll come,\" he said\nand wheeled off, not giving it another\nthought.\nThe universe, in her gentle way, never\nleaves things to just a single chance.\nShe places more than one hint in front\nof a person. Emery's friend Keith came\nby and asked Emery to go to this Con-\ntact Improvisation workshop with him.\nEmery shrugged, \"OK.\" It would prob-\nably be an all right way to spend a\nweekend. Why not. So he went.\nInteresting stuff started to happen.\nPeople with all kinds of disabilities\nwere sliding out of their wheelchairs\nand rolling around on the floor, moving\nwith able-bodied people. That, in and of\nitself, wasn't so unusual. Physical Ther-\napy and Therapeutic Recreation created\nthat kind of experience. What was\ndifferent was the feeling. The attitude.\nThese people weren't trying to make\nEmery move faster or differently than\nhis body could or wanted to. These\npeople didn't sit there, waiting, with\ndisguised impatience as Emery tried to\ncatch up to them. No. These people\nacknowledged his body, its particular\nmovement style and speed as perfectly\nnormal and acceptable. Just as Emery\nhad done since birth.\nMore than that, they actively appreci-\nated his movements as something\nthey'd like to learn to experience, to use\nin their own repertoire in dances. Alito\nhas often said that he creates the Dance-\nAbility workshops for selfish reasons.\nMost people credit him with a do-good-\ner attitude of bringing dance and move-\nment to the disabled. \"Ain't he just\nsuch a good-hearted guy?\" Alito laughs.\n\"I do this because it brings me more\ninformation I can use in my own explo-\nration of physical movement and dance.\nEveryone has body movement habits.\nIn order to break my habits, I try on\nother people's movements, like a new\nhat or a shirt. I gain a great deal from\npeople with disabilities. They show me\nhow to move and experience my body\nin new ways.\"\nEmery laughs, \"You learn by other\npeople's movements. It's the opposite\nfor me. I'm learning to relax and ex-\nplore my own movements, without the\npressure from others to do it 'more\nnormally' or faster. It's freedom to feel\nmy own natural rhythms and be accept-\ned and enjoyed for being exactly who I\nam.\"\nEmery went to several DanceAbility\nworkshops, which are presented once a\nyear. After the second workshop, Em-\nery attended another Joint Forces\nevent-the Breitenbush Contact Jam, an\nannual weeklong international gathering\nof contact improvisors. At that first\njam, Emery realized there was more to\nthis dance than just having fun. Here,\nhe created and performed in his first\nchoreography, a group piece called\nBumped. Asked how he created Bumped,\nEmery described it in this way: \"I was\ntrying to get across that I am not dis-\nabled and that anyone could become\ndisabled any time. Sometimes when\nyou are seen as disabled, you become\ninvisible. I was coming back to the jam\nafter spending a day at the Salem Legis-\nlature lobbying for the rights of the\ndisabled. I was thinking about that\nexperience. They thought I was dis-\nabled, but when I returned to the jam,\nthese people did not think of me as dis-\nabled. Hey, neat, I thought That\nwould be a neat dance. I was thinking\nof my political work, how I always try\nto tell them you have more chances of\nbecoming disabled than you do winning\nthe lottery!!\n\"So, at the jam, four of us were play-\ning around with the idea. I told them\nthe main idea and we worked from\nthat. Everything else just fell into\nplace.\" When someone was bumped\ninto the wheelchair, they became invisi-\nble and the others would continue danc-\ning, bumping into the wheelchair with-\nout noticing it or the person in it Then\nthe person would get bumped out of\nthe chair and become visible and the\nothers would begin relating to them\nagain and someone else would get\nknocked into the chair and become\ninvisible, etc. \"The chair made the piece\neither fast or slow. If you dance with a\nchair, it governs the speed.\n\"I'll tell you something else,\" Emery\ncontinued. \"Dance has helped me reach\npeople more powerfully than my years\nof lobbying the legislature have. As\nPresident of OIL (Oregonians for Inde-\npendent Living), I have spent hours\n(which sometimes feels more like years)\nintellectually talking about equality,\nequal access, that we are people too,\njust like everyone else. I'd talk and talk\nand make small progress. But one\ndance and people just 'get' it. It opens\nup communication in more equal ways.\"\nAlito and Emery did a performance\nfor the Governor's Arts Awards at the\nHult Center in Eugene, Oregon. After\nthe show, Emery sat back, trying to be\nout of the way, but he failed! These\npeople, white, rich, older, the same\npeople Emery lobbied at the State\nHouse, came up to him. They lined up\nto express their admiration about the\ndance.\nThey responded to Emery in just the\nsame way the Eugene schoolchildren\ndid. Emery and Alito did their dance\nfor 8 different schools in a three week\nperiod. Five thousand kids saw Emery\nand Alito dance. A barrier had been\nbroken. It was OK to reach out and\ntalk to this human being.\nThe dance made people question their\nown enculturated thinking. The Wheels\nof Fortune dance is all about who sup-\nports whom, what helps what, who is\ndisabled and who is able-bodied.\nSometimes the wheelchair supports\nEmery, sometimes Alito. Sometimes\nEmery supports the chair, or Alito\nwears the chair, or a \"normal\" chair (one\nwithout wheels, a mere Chevrolet com-\npared to a Cadillac) is the support. It\nall twists and turns, changing like a\nkaleidoscope. That is the truth. And\nthat truth is different than the set-in-\nconcrete notions of the general \"tempo-\nrarily able-bodied\" person. They think\nthe chair holds up the person, period.\nEnd of discussion. The piece dances\naround the question of 'What is\nnormal?\"\nThat isn't a question that Emery\nspends much time on. He knows what\nis normal. His body and the way it\nmoves is normal That's the way it has\nbeen from birth. Unlike a person who\nmeets with an accident later on, Emery\nhas no memories of it being different.\nThe trouble is that other people haven't\nalways agreed. They spent time and\nenergy trying to get Emery's body to\nmove differently and faster.\nWhen he was growing up, he'd get\naround by crawling on his knees every-\nwhere. The floor, the lawn, the gravel,\nit didn't matter. Then he got a manual\nwheelchair. He'd propel himself\naround by pushing himself backwards,\nlooking over his right shoulder to see\nwhere he was going. As a result, the\nskin on his knees went soft, no longer\ncalloused, making him unable to crawl\nover the ground without pain. Now,\nthat was a disability.\nAt the age of 18, Emery got a power\nwheelchair and suddenly had to change\nhis body habits and look forward in\norder to avoid crashing into walls and\nrunning over people. For the first time\nin his life~ he felt disabled. It was a\nchange from old habits. He had to\nadjust to it. Feeling disabled was not\nan always kind of thing; it would occa-\nsionally pop into Emery's head, but\nmostly, he was thinking about bike\nriding.\nAfter he was introduced to the bike,\nhe spent some time struggling, barely\nable to get around the block. With\npractice and time, he now tours around\nthe state, on weeklong treks, zooming\ndownhill at 35 miles an hour. What\nEmery loves about bike riding is the\nsame thing he's learning to love about\ndance. Freedom, acceptance and being\nin control independently.\nContact Improvisation has made some\nchanges in Emery's life. Physically, he\nhas learned to move more smoothly\nwith better balance. On bike rides,\nEmery used to push hard and with\njerky movements to propel his bike on\nthe 40 or more mile treks. Now, his\npacing is softer, smoother and more\npowerful A clear demonstration of his\ncapability at better balancing happened\nin the bathtub. He fell and his body\nused the new dance techniques of roll-\ning he had learned. A safe landing.\nHe learned to have more fun. Actual-\nly, that's not true. Emery always has\nfun. He learned a new way to have fun\nwhen he began dancing. One of the\nmajor commitments Alito and Emery\nhave in their dance work is to have fun\nas they are dancing. If they are having\nfun, this will telegraph to the audience\nwho will be able to relax more and have\nfun with them.\nEmery discovered the power of the\nunspoken word-the speech of dance\nand movement that tells stories and\nfeelings more completely than the spo-\nken word. Although the main reason\nEmery dances is for the fun and for the\npersonal experience and satisfaction, he\ncan't avoid the educational aspects of\nhis dancing. Simply because he is dis-\nabled, everything he does teaches.\nDance, Emery has learned, is a marvel-\nous, positive teaching tool. He will be\nvolunteering his time giving perfor-\nmances in the schools and Alito is\nworking on grant proposals to create a\nweeklong DanceAbility workshop next\nyear.\nAt the DanceAbility workshops, peo-\nple have more time to interact with him,\nEmery notes-to experience him long\nenough to break through their own\nmental barriers. Often people start out\nhesitant or outright reluctant \"It is the\ndifficulty understanding my speech, I\nthink, that distresses them the most\nAfter they realize I am an intelligent\nhuman being, they feel relieved,\" Emery\nsays.\nAn interesting thing happens for Em-\nery at these workshops. There are peo-\nple at the workshop that are \"more\ndisabled\" than he is. And Emery finds\nthat he tends to relate more with the\nable-bodied participants than with the\nmore disabled. Having to slow his\nmovements down to dance with people\nwith more severe disabilities than he\nhas (and less dance experience), Emery\nbegan to understand and have more\nAt one jam, Emery danced with Gerry\nOverington of England. Gerry is blind.\nEmery had never danced with someone\nwho couldn't take visual cues as to\nwhat the next move might be. Now\nEmery was experiencing what able-\nbodied people experience when they\ndance with him: assuming they need to\ntake more responsibility for leading,\ninitiating the movement. This was a\nsomewhat new experience for Emery.\nHis dances have evolved from a passive\nresponding to a more active pursuit and\nexploration of movement in contact\nwith others in space. But, isn't that\nwhat Contact Improvisation is all about?\nEmery also has gained the personal\nfreedom of acceptance. Among dancers,\nhe is accepted as a dancer. His own\nnormal body movements and speeds\nare fine just the way they are.\nYou know, it's funny that society has\ndecided to label someone who walks\ndifferently or not at all as disabled.\nOften, it's the so-called \"able-bodied\"\nperson with fine motor skills, that has\ndisabilities-like not being able to get\nalong well with others, or express their\nemotions, or feeling unhappy and de-\npressed. When people who are strug-\ngling with their own pain see someone\nphysically disabled, they often project\ntheir initer feelings of inadequacy and\npain onto the disabled person. They\nlatch onto the disabled person, wanting\nto help them, soothe their supposed\npain and make everything all better.\nThe trouble is, it doesn't work. It back-\nfires. Because it's not the disabled per-\nson's pain. It's theirs. People often say\nhow it hurts them to hear Emery's\nknees thump on the floor during his\ndance, thinking it hurts him. Emery\nsays, \"Sure, sometimes it hurts. Mostly,\nit doesn't. But everything in life costs a\nlittle pain. If you want to really help,\nlet me experience my own pain my own\nway.\"\nPeople at dance workshops are often\nworried they will hurt Emery, but he's\nas tough as hickory wood. By being\nafraid to roll on him or put weight on\nhim, they lessen the dance experience\nfor both of them. Emery tries to tell\nthem it's OK; after they get over their\noriginal resistance, Emery gets bounced\noff the walls and loves it\nIn the workshops, it also happens that\npeople often talk to somebody else\nwhen they are talking to Emery, as\nthough they think he is deaf as well as\nhas speech problems.\nBut these are minor annoyances, ones\nEmery meets with every day of his life.\nWhat Emery gains from dance is well\nworth the difficulties. Dance has wid-\nened his circle of friends. Like bike\nriding, it has given him an opportunity\nto meet people on an equal basis.\nDance speaks for him, breaking down\nbarriers and walls like so many tinker\ntoys.*",

    "Text": "In the Fall of 1990, with Bruce\nCurtis, co-founder of The Exposed To\nGravity Project, I began teaching a\ncourse at The University of California\nat Berkeley called The Moving Body.\nHaving facilitated movement work-\nshops for disabled and non-disabled\nadults, adolescents and children for\nfive years, Bruce and I were interested\nin bringing our work into the universi-\nty setting where movement exploration\ncould be sustained throughout a se-\nmester-length period of time.\nThe city of Berkeley bas one of the\nmost visible and active disabled com-\nmunities in this country. At the uni-\nversity, several organizations are cen-\ntered around the creation of programs\nand services for both the public and\nstudent disabled populations. Despite\nthe efforts of independent recreational\nsports programs on campus, disabled\nstudents lacked support and inclusion\nfrom the Physical Education or Dance\nDepartments. While issues such as\nliability and accessibility were often\nheard, there clearly were no university\ninstructors who had the orientation and\nskills with which to develop a viable\ncourse where people of different abili-\nties could move and interact with one\nanother.\nThe Exposed To Gravity Project\nwas given county and campus organi-\nzational support and we designed and\nimplemented a course through the\nDepartment of Dance and Dramatic\nArts. Undergraduate and graduate-\nlevel students would receive academic\ncredit and provisions were made for\nallowing public participation as well.\nFew administrators nor faculty fully\nunderstood the history or scope of our\nwork and they had no precedent for a\ncourse of this nature from any other\ncollege or university in the country.\nWith a class of twenty five students,\nwe had an even ratio of those with and\nwithout physical disabilities. Students\nwere majoring in and doing graduate\nstudies in dance, theatre, psychology,\nanthropology, social welfare and pub-\nlic health. Disabilities included multi-\nple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spina\nbifida, polio, arthritis and spinal-cord\nrelated injuries resulting in paraplegia\nand quadriplegia. Discussing disabili-\nties as limitations and differences that\nare not always apparent, several people\nin the class considered themselves as\nhaving \"hidden disabilities,\" such as\nchronic fatigue syndrome. As in all of\nour past workshops, there were mixed\nfeelings of excitement, caution, confu-\nsion and an appreciation for new pos-\nsibilities.\nAs a movement practice, Contact\nImprovisation has been at the center of\nour work, providing a coherent physi-\ncal language for all participants. The\nfocus on physicality and sensation\nestablished a ground for the stimula-\ntion and discussion of personal, social\nand political issues that became imme-\ndiately relevant and integral to The\nMoving Body. This course is one that\nfeeds into areas that are societal, clini-\ncal, bio-medical, theoretical, educative,\npsychological, artistic, performance-\noriented and, largely, improvisational.\nSteven E. Brown, in his article,\n\"Creating a Disability Mythology,\"\nadds what may be another component\narea of the course, or an entire con-\ntainer holding all of the before-men-\ntioned areas. He says:\n\"Language, humor, music, stereo-\ntypes, history, heroes. Each of\nthese shared experiences comprise\nelements of a culture. People\nwith disabilities are beginning to\nrecognize that we, as a group,\nhave been developing each of the\naforementioned topics into our\nown culture-a disability culture.\nI am convinced that every commu-\nnity harbors many heroes with\ndisabilities. I believe it is time to\nwork on the development of a\ndisability mythology. Myth is\nmore accessible than a document-\ned history of events; myth permits\nus to be creative and expand our\ntale into a story to be repeated\nand retold for generations, a form\nunderstood by every other cul-\nture.\"\nWe live in a culture that holds strict\ndefinitions and value judgements about\nwhat it sees as moving and not mov-\ning. With so much of daily motion\nand perception dictated by task, func-\ntion and particular examples of pro-\nductivity, movement at deeper levels\nthan external appearances are less\nvalued, ignored, and, at worst, unper-\nceived. How we are being seen by\nothers influences our self-image, pres-\nence and movements in the world. In\nour classes, I feel that we were creat-\ning new layers of a collective story, a\nbody politic or body mythology.\nMyths take shape in a ritualized space.\nSeveral guest teachers (Dance and\nDrama Therapist, Bronwyn Warren;\nFeldenkrais teacher, Lawrence Gold-\nfarb; and Dance Therapist, Neala\nHaze) were invited to present their\nwork during the semester. Neala\nfacilitated a session in Authentic\nMovement. Having each student move\nwith eyes closed, \"witnessed\" by the\ngroup, was a beautiful and evocative\nritual space. We were able to appreci-\nate the most subtly articulated move-\nments of each person, sensing and\nreferring to our own bodies for the\ndepth of response we gave one\nanother.\nThe experiential practice of the\ncourse was augmented with readings\non dance, performance history, body\nsystems, developmental movement,\nperception, sensory awareness, somatic\ntherapies, communication theories and\nthe use of touch in human experience.\nStudents kept journals and papers were\npart of the requirements for academic\ncredit.\nMany of the early classes brought\nforth the awkwardness and anxiety\naround physical touch between dis-\nabled and non-disabled partnering. It\nis very common for non-disabled\npeople to feel hesitant and fearful of\nhaving physical contact with a person\nin a wheelchair or one whose physical\nform is shaped and moves differently\nthan their own. Often it is assumed\nthat the disabled person is brittle, in\npain or umesponsive to being touched.\nIn the class, students were strongly\nencouraged to express their needs,\nphysical functioning and capabilities to\none another. This exchange of person-\nal information helped to relax them\nand elicit trust of an improvised and\ncollaborative spirit.\nWhen encouraged to leave their\nwheelchair or crutches through their\nown movement or with assistance, the\ninitial experiences of many disabled\nstudents (and of the non-disabled\nassistant) ranged from extreme disori-\nentation and vulnerability, to pleasure\nand intense joy. A contained and safe\nenvironment in which to express feel-\nings is very important in this context.\nThe process of dialoguing after danc-\ning allowed for us to speak from\nchanges in self-image and self-organi-\nzation with increased awareness, sensi-\ntivity and a mutual regard for one\nanother as moving, embodied beings in\nthe world\nOur learning environment carried as\nmuch influence as any of the specific\nskills for falling and supporting\nweight. Deane Juhan, in his book\nJob's Body (Station Hill Press, 1987),\nconveys a layer of this learning envi-\nronment from a physiological under-\nstanding: \"The process is anything but\nrandom or trial and error. It is highly\nspecific, and it is the periphery which\nhelps to organize the connections in\nthe central nervous system, not an\norganized central nervous system\nwhich reaches out to innervate the\nperiphery. It suggests that the use of\ntouch and sensation to modify our\nexperience of peripheral conditions\nexerts an active influence upon the\norganization of reflexes and body\nimage deep within the central nervous\nsystem.\" Clearly, not all of the class\nparticipants came with the same inten-\ntions and interests. Most students,\nboth disabled and non-disabled, loved\nthe freedom to play and seek new\nphysical forms, to feel themselves\nbuoyant and resilient, fearless and\nbeautiful in their dance.\nIn the past year, I've been facilitat-\ning groups and workshops for profes-\nsionals who work with or wish to\nextend their practice to physically\ndisabled men and women. While\nworking with movement and somatic\npractitioners, the focus is on how we\nmake contact with ourselves while\ntouching, supporting and moving with\nsomeone who has a physical disability.\nWe look at ways to establish more of\na peer relationship. This process is a\nrisky one. Conventional and tradition-\nal techniques are challenged, while\nmutual dependency and the unknown\nare brought into the relationship. This\nis a process that medical science has\nlittle familiarity with.\nThe impact of this course as ex-\npressed through responses from the\nstudents and faculty of The Moving\nBody strongly indicate a need and\ndesire for the continuance of this work\nin university, clinical, community and\nartistic settings. *\nThe Moving Body was videotaped and is\navailable to the public (see Dance Map in\nthis issue).",

    "Text": "Accept your limits. I ask that students allow themselves the permission to realize their limitations.\nI also encourage the sudden stretch beyond limitation. To see within this language the existence of\na subtle yet expansive definition of the word 'risk'. \"Isn't that very risky?\" asked a student looking\nup at a friend pivoting in the valley between neck and shoulder of her partner. I believe this work\nand other explorations compatible with Contact always involve the element of risk, whether we are\nrolling along air-born arcs or standing still.\nAs flow does not mean slow, receptivity needn't be measured by passivity. 'Listening' is one of my\nfavorite words in describing the force behind transition.\nAttention needs to wander to stay interested. In the teacher, your partner, yourself.

Besides the basic sense of too much or not enough (alternately, I've been told by students\nhow there is excessive technical input or a frustration due to a casual and modest directive), we learn\nto use the word if it fits. Of course there is still much more to say.\nIn one of his first introductory classes, asking: \"ls the contact point the tension between trust and\nresponsibility?\" In agreement - yes, Danny, there seems to be many levels of lifting experience.\nDancing well with new students is the most advanced part of my learning.",

    "Text": "The Fountain is a form for collective watching and reporting\none's experience of watching. It is a direct way of sharing\nwith a dancer some evidence of what happened in each of\nus as we watched her dance. It can be used for listening\nto music, poetry, looking at a painting, etc., just as well. !rs\nmost important feature is that discussion is not allowed: It\nhas four parts:\n1. Watching\n2. Writing-immediately, for 3 minutes, in silence\n3. Reading-out loud, in a circle, only what you wrote\n4. Collecting and printing what was written\nIn August 1991, feeling a collective need for\nfeedback and support in the new dance and perfor-\nmance community, I conceived of I.D.E.A. (Internation-\nal Dance Exchange, Amsterdam). In October, I collab-\norated with Dutch choreographer Pauline de Groot to\ncreate a platform for such an exchange-monthly\nI.D.E.A. meetings at Pauline's studio \"DE KOE.\" On\nthe Saturday closest to the middle of the month,\nI.D.E.A. sponsors an open showing of work and perfor-\nmance/audience interaction structures, followed by\ninformal exchange.\nAt these meetings, I have been developing a form\ncalled The Fountain, in which spontaneous reflections\nare written during a three-minute pause between\ndances/performances. These spontaneous writings are\nread, without discussion, at the end of the entire show-\ning. The writings are then gathered and published in\nthe now-bimonthly I.D.E.A LOG, nee I.D.E.A. News-\nletter. The Fountain form and its resultant writings\nconstitute the beginning of an on-going experiment\ncentral to the purpose of I.D.E.A.: To further the explo-\nration of dance as a collective experience in present\ntime and space, and to create forms through which\nglimpses of that experience can be passed.\nOver the course of the first I.D.E.A. meetings, I\nfound that by restricting formal performance feedback\nto only reading what was written during the three\nminutes between seeing pieces kept the exchange vital,\nsurprising and full of imagination. To be in communi-\ncation with, rather than about, what was seen opened\nup a more direct and creative transference between\naudience and performer, an exchange in the dimension\ndance comes from: the imagination.\nThe model is conversation: taking each dance as a\nstatement and responding likewise. The realness of\nthe moment and our mutual share in creating that\nmoment is not conditioned or tamed in any way by\ncalling a dance a \"work-in-progress.\" The moment is\nstill absolute; the future we envision may never arrive;\nthe improvements we seek are secondary. In conversa-\ntion, someone says to you, \"I love you!\" You don't\nrespond by telling them they should focus more on\ntheir pronunciation. You say, \"I love you, too.\" Or you\nsay something else. So this experiment is a challenge\nto us to be in the moment with the performer.\nAlthough my dream is to have a gathering of all\nkinds of artists, all kinds of people, the truth remains\nthat we as an audience for each other are primarily\ndancers. And this is, we are, a gold mine of attention\n-'-highly developed attention-for each other. As danc-\ners we are skilled as listeners-listening to our sensa-\ntions, to the moment we are in, to the transformation\nof energy through the moment, to the level of state-\nment that moves you when you see it. It is this won-\nderful degree of listening that we bring with us to each\nOpen Showing. The dances are the tips of the icebergs\nof our experience. They are the part we can show.\nFor complete information on I.D.E.A meetings and I.D.E.A.\nLOG, contact Christina Svane, Ruysdaelkade 25b, 1072 AH\nAmsterdam. Tel. (020) 662-6827.",
